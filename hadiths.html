Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from some of his people from Hisham ibn al-Hakam who has said the following. “Things can be perceived by two means: (1) By the senses and (2) by the heart, intellect. Perceptions of the senses are of three kinds: (1) Perception in the form of penetration, (2) Perception in the form of touching, and (3) Perception without penetration or touCh Perception by means of sounds, smells and tastes are formed through penetration. Perception through touching comes from the knowledge of shapes, such as rectangular or triangular etc., and also softness, hardness, heat and cold. Perception without touch or penetration is that of sight which is capable of perceiving things without touching or penetration, directly or indirectly. Perception through sight needs a path and medium. Its path is air and its medium is the light. If the path is continuous between the viewer and the object and the medium then seeing takes place such as colors and persons. If light falls on something without a path, it will return reflecting what is behind (the observed), like an observer looking into a mirror. Light does not penetrate into the mirror, because it finds no path. So it returns reflecting what lies behind the observed. It is similar to looking into the clear water returns light that reflects what is at the rear. This happens because there is no path for the penetration of light. Intellect dominates the air. It perceives all that is in the air and forms his Wahm (intuitive form of perception). If the heart will not find any thing in the air it comes back and reflects what is in the air. A person of reason should not force his heart against what is not in the air of the issue of the Oneness of Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, otherwise, it will form his Wahm of what is there in the air as mentioned about the eye-witnessing. Allah, the Most High is far and above similarities with the creatures.”",

    "englishText": " 14. A group of our companions narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad, from Ali ibn Hadeed, from Sama’ah ibn Mehran, who said: \"I was with Abu Abdullah (a.s) and a group of his followers were also present. The discussion turned to the topics of intellect and ignorance. Abu Abdullah (a.s) said: 'Recognize intellect and its soldiers, and ignorance and its soldiers, and you will be guided.' Sama’ah said: 'I said, \"May I be your ransom, we know only what you have taught us.\"' Abu Abdullah (a.s) replied: 'Indeed, Allah the Mighty and Majestic created intellect, and it was the first creation among the spiritual beings, on the right side of the Throne, from His light. Then He said to it, \"Move back,\" and it moved back. Then He said to it, \"Come forward,\" and it came forward. Then Allah, blessed and exalted, said: \"I created you as a great creation and honored you over all My creations.\" Then He created ignorance from the dark, salty sea. He said to it, \"Move back,\" and it moved back. Then He said to it, \"Come forward,\" but it did not come forward. He said to it, \"Did you act arrogantly?\" So He cursed it. Then He made for intellect seventy-five soldiers. When ignorance saw the honor Allah had bestowed upon intellect and what He had given it, it harbored enmity towards it. Ignorance said: \"O Lord, this is a creation like me. You created it, honored it, and strengthened it, and I am its opposite. I have no power over it, so give me soldiers like those You have given it.\" Allah said: \"Yes, but if you disobey after that, I will expel you and your soldiers from My mercy.\" Ignorance said: \"I am satisfied.\" So He gave it seventy-five soldiers. \u003Cbr\u003EAmong what He gave to intellect from the seventy-five soldiers were: goodness, which is the minister of intellect, and He made its opposite evil, which is the minister of ignorance; faith, and its opposite disbelief; affirmation, and its opposite denial; hope, and its opposite despair; justice, and its opposite injustice; contentment, and its opposite discontent; gratitude, and its opposite ingratitude; greed, and its opposite hopelessness; reliance (on Allah), and its opposite covetousness; compassion, and its opposite hardness; mercy, and its opposite anger; knowledge, and its opposite ignorance; understanding, and its opposite folly; chastity, and its opposite promiscuity; asceticism, and its opposite desire; gentleness, and its opposite coarseness; fear, and its opposite audacity; humility, and its opposite arrogance; deliberation, and its opposite hastiness; forbearance, and its opposite foolishness; silence, and its opposite verbosity; surrender, and its opposite arrogance; acceptance, and its opposite doubt; patience, and its opposite impatience; forgiveness, and its opposite vengeance; wealth, and its opposite poverty; remembrance, and its opposite forgetfulness; preservation, and its opposite neglect; kindness, and its opposite cutting off; contentment, and its opposite greed; sharing, and its opposite withholding; friendship, and its opposite enmity; loyalty, and its opposite betrayal; obedience, and its opposite disobedience; submission, and its opposite insolence; safety, and its opposite affliction; love, and its opposite hatred; truthfulness, and its opposite lying; truth, and its opposite falsehood; trustworthiness, and its opposite treachery; sincerity, and its opposite hypocrisy; discernment, and its opposite dullness; understanding, and its opposite stupidity; recognition, and its opposite denial; diplomacy, and its opposite disclosure; safeguarding the unseen, and its opposite cunning; concealment, and its opposite revelation; prayer, and its opposite neglect; fasting, and its opposite breaking the fast; striving (in Allah's way), and its opposite retreat; pilgrimage, and its opposite breaking the covenant; protection of speech, and its opposite slander; righteousness to parents, and its opposite disobedience; reality, and its opposite ostentation; virtue, and its opposite vice; concealment, and its opposite display; precaution, and its opposite publicity; fairness, and its opposite bias; preparation, and its opposite transgression; cleanliness, and its opposite filthiness; modesty, and its opposite shamelessness; moderation, and its opposite aggression; rest, and its opposite fatigue; ease, and its opposite difficulty; blessing, and its opposite curse; well-being, and its opposite affliction; uprightness, and its opposite excess; wisdom, and its opposite desire; dignity, and its opposite frivolity; happiness, and its opposite misery; repentance, and its opposite insistence (on sin); seeking forgiveness, and its opposite deception; preservation, and its opposite neglect; supplication, and its opposite disdain; activity, and its opposite laziness; joy, and its opposite sadness; unity, and its opposite separation; generosity, and its opposite stinginess. \u003Cbr\u003EThese qualities from the soldiers of the intellect are not all found together in anyone except in a prophet, or the successor of a prophet, or a believer whose heart Allah has tested for faith. As for the rest of our followers, none of them is free from having some of these soldiers until they are complete and cleansed from the soldiers of ignorance.

    "thaqalaynSanad": " 14. A group of our companions narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad, from Ali ibn Hadeed, from Sama’ah ibn Mehran, who said: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "\"I was with Abu Abdullah (a.s) and a group of his followers were also present. The discussion turned to the topics of intellect and ignorance. Abu Abdullah (a.s) said: 'Recognize intellect and its soldiers, and ignorance and its soldiers, and you will be guided.' Sama’ah said: 'I said, \"May I be your ransom, we know only what you have taught us.\"' Abu Abdullah (a.s) replied: 'Indeed, Allah the Mighty and Majestic created intellect, and it was the first creation among the spiritual beings, on the right side of the Throne, from His light. Then He said to it, \"Move back,\" and it moved back. Then He said to it, \"Come forward,\" and it came forward. Then Allah, blessed and exalted, said: \"I created you as a great creation and honored you over all My creations.\" Then He created ignorance from the dark, salty sea. He said to it, \"Move back,\" and it moved back. Then He said to it, \"Come forward,\" but it did not come forward. He said to it, \"Did you act arrogantly?\" So He cursed it. Then He made for intellect seventy-five soldiers. When ignorance saw the honor Allah had bestowed upon intellect and what He had given it, it harbored enmity towards it. Ignorance said: \"O Lord, this is a creation like me. You created it, honored it, and strengthened it, and I am its opposite. I have no power over it, so give me soldiers like those You have given it.\" Allah said: \"Yes, but if you disobey after that, I will expel you and your soldiers from My mercy.\" Ignorance said: \"I am satisfied.\" So He gave it seventy-five soldiers. \u003Cbr\u003EAmong what He gave to intellect from the seventy-five soldiers were: goodness, which is the minister of intellect, and He made its opposite evil, which is the minister of ignorance; faith, and its opposite disbelief; affirmation, and its opposite denial; hope, and its opposite despair; justice, and its opposite injustice; contentment, and its opposite discontent; gratitude, and its opposite ingratitude; greed, and its opposite hopelessness; reliance (on Allah), and its opposite covetousness; compassion, and its opposite hardness; mercy, and its opposite anger; knowledge, and its opposite ignorance; understanding, and its opposite folly; chastity, and its opposite promiscuity; asceticism, and its opposite desire; gentleness, and its opposite coarseness; fear, and its opposite audacity; humility, and its opposite arrogance; deliberation, and its opposite hastiness; forbearance, and its opposite foolishness; silence, and its opposite verbosity; surrender, and its opposite arrogance; acceptance, and its opposite doubt; patience, and its opposite impatience; forgiveness, and its opposite vengeance; wealth, and its opposite poverty; remembrance, and its opposite forgetfulness; preservation, and its opposite neglect; kindness, and its opposite cutting off; contentment, and its opposite greed; sharing, and its opposite withholding; friendship, and its opposite enmity; loyalty, and its opposite betrayal; obedience, and its opposite disobedience; submission, and its opposite insolence; safety, and its opposite affliction; love, and its opposite hatred; truthfulness, and its opposite lying; truth, and its opposite falsehood; trustworthiness, and its opposite treachery; sincerity, and its opposite hypocrisy; discernment, and its opposite dullness; understanding, and its opposite stupidity; recognition, and its opposite denial; diplomacy, and its opposite disclosure; safeguarding the unseen, and its opposite cunning; concealment, and its opposite revelation; prayer, and its opposite neglect; fasting, and its opposite breaking the fast; striving (in Allah's way), and its opposite retreat; pilgrimage, and its opposite breaking the covenant; protection of speech, and its opposite slander; righteousness to parents, and its opposite disobedience; reality, and its opposite ostentation; virtue, and its opposite vice; concealment, and its opposite display; precaution, and its opposite publicity; fairness, and its opposite bias; preparation, and its opposite transgression; cleanliness, and its opposite filthiness; modesty, and its opposite shamelessness; moderation, and its opposite aggression; rest, and its opposite fatigue; ease, and its opposite difficulty; blessing, and its opposite curse; well-being, and its opposite affliction; uprightness, and its opposite excess; wisdom, and its opposite desire; dignity, and its opposite frivolity; happiness, and its opposite misery; repentance, and its opposite insistence (on sin); seeking forgiveness, and its opposite deception; preservation, and its opposite neglect; supplication, and its opposite disdain; activity, and its opposite laziness; joy, and its opposite sadness; unity, and its opposite separation; generosity, and its opposite stinginess. \u003Cbr\u003EThese qualities from the soldiers of the intellect are not all found together in anyone except in a prophet, or the successor of a prophet, or a believer whose heart Allah has tested for faith. As for the rest of our followers, none of them is free from having some of these soldiers until they are complete and cleansed from the soldiers of ignorance. At that time, they will be in the highest degree with the prophets and successors. This can only be achieved by recognizing intellect and its soldiers and avoiding ignorance and its soldiers. May Allah grant us and you success in obeying Him and seeking His pleasure.'\"",

    "englishText": " 2. (Through the same chain of narrators) it has been narrated from Abi ‘Abdillah (a.s.) who has said the following. “Once, in a meeting in the presence of my father with a group of people also present my father smiled and (the feeling was quite intense it caused) tears flooded his eyes. He then asked, “Do you know what made me laugh?” The narrator has said that they said, “No, we do not know the reason.” The Imam (a.s.) said, “Ibn ‘Abbas thinks he is of the people mention in the following verse of the Holy Quran. “To those who have said, “God is our Lord, “ and who have remained steadfast to their belief, the angels will descend saying, “Do not be afraid or grieved. Receive the glad news of the Paradise which was promised to you.” (41:30). I asked him, “Have you seen the angels, O Ibn ‘Abbas, telling you of the fact that they guard and protect you in this and the next world and provide you complete protection and security from fear and sadness?” The Imam (a.s.) then said that Ibn ‘Abbas said, “Believers are each other’s brothers. . .” (49:10) the whole community is included in this verse.” I then laughed.” Then I said, “O Ibn ‘Abbas, you (perhaps) are right. However, I ask you to swear to Allah and answer me truthfully. Is there any disharmony in the judgment of Allah, Majestic is Whose mention?” He said, “No, there is no disharmony in His judgment.” “I then asked him, “How would you judge the case in which a man strikes the fingers of another man with a sword until they fall. Then another man comes and cuts off his palm. He is brought to you and you are the judge. How would you then judge?” He said, “I will order the one who cut off the palm to pay compensation for the whole hand. I will ask the affected party to reach a settlement with the defendant and for this purpose I send them to the people of justice (arbitrator).” I said, “(In your judgment) disharmony has come in the laws of Allah, Majestic is Whose mention, thus, you invalidated what you said before (that there is no disharmony in the laws and judgment of Allah). Allah, Majestic is Whose mention, disdains to let a judicial case remain on earth without a clarified rule. You must order, as a judge, to cut the palm of the defendant totally and pay compensation for the fingers. Thus, is the judgment of Allah at the night wherein His orders descend. If you would reject after hearing from the Messenger of Allah then Allah will send you to fire just as He blinded you on the day you hid the (truth) in favor of Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.).” Ibn ‘Abbas then said, “Is that why my eyes have become blind?” He further said, “How would you know that? I swear by Allah that my eyes turned blind only because of the flapping of the wing of the angel.” The Imam (a.s.) said, “That made me laugh.

Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) told you that the Night of Determination comes every year. On that night the command for the whole year comes down. For that matter and command is the people with Divine authority after the Messenger of Allah. You then asked, “Who are these people?” He (Ali (a.s.) said, “I myself and the eleven men from my descendents will be the Imams (leaders with divine authority) and the (people to whom angels speak) Muhaddathun.” You then said, “I do not see it (Night of Determination) except with the Messenger of Allah. Then the angel appeared to you; the angels that was speaking to him and said, “O ‘Abdallah, you have lied. My eyes see it (the Night of Determination).of which Ali (a.s.) spoke to you. His (Ali’s ) eyes did not see him (the angel) but his heart understood (the presence of the angel) and he impacted his ears. Then he (angel) flapped you with his wing and you turned blind.” Ibn ‘Abbas then said, “In the matters that we dispute it is up to Allah to judge.” I then said to him, “Has Allah judged one case with two judgments?” He replied, “No, Allah has not done so.” I then said, “Here you perish and cause others to perish.”",

    "thaqalaynSanad": " 2. (Through the same chain of narrators) it has been narrated from Abi ‘Abdillah (a.s.) who has said the following. ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "“Once, in a meeting in the presence of my father with a group of people also present my father smiled and (the feeling was quite intense it caused) tears flooded his eyes. He then asked, “Do you know what made me laugh?” The narrator has said that they said, “No, we do not know the reason.” The Imam (a.s.) said, “Ibn ‘Abbas thinks he is of the people mention in the following verse of the Holy Quran. “To those who have said, “God is our Lord, “ and who have remained steadfast to their belief, the angels will descend saying, “Do not be afraid or grieved. Receive the glad news of the Paradise which was promised to you.” (41:30). I asked him, “Have you seen the angels, O Ibn ‘Abbas, telling you of the fact that they guard and protect you in this and the next world and provide you complete protection and security from fear and sadness?” The Imam (a.s.) then said that Ibn ‘Abbas said, “Believers are each other’s brothers. . .” (49:10) the whole community is included in this verse.” I then laughed.” Then I said, “O Ibn ‘Abbas, you (perhaps) are right. However, I ask you to swear to Allah and answer me truthfully. Is there any disharmony in the judgment of Allah, Majestic is Whose mention?” He said, “No, there is no disharmony in His judgment.” “I then asked him, “How would you judge the case in which a man strikes the fingers of another man with a sword until they fall. Then another man comes and cuts off his palm. He is brought to you and you are the judge. How would you then judge?” He said, “I will order the one who cut off the palm to pay compensation for the whole hand. I will ask the affected party to reach a settlement with the defendant and for this purpose I send them to the people of justice (arbitrator).” I said, “(In your judgment) disharmony has come in the laws of Allah, Majestic is Whose mention, thus, you invalidated what you said before (that there is no disharmony in the laws and judgment of Allah). Allah, Majestic is Whose mention, disdains to let a judicial case remain on earth without a clarified rule. You must order, as a judge, to cut the palm of the defendant totally and pay compensation for the fingers. Thus, is the judgment of Allah at the night wherein His orders descend. If you would reject after hearing from the Messenger of Allah then Allah will send you to fire just as He blinded you on the day you hid the (truth) in favor of Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.).” Ibn ‘Abbas then said, “Is that why my eyes have become blind?” He further said, “How would you know that? I swear by Allah that my eyes turned blind only because of the flapping of the wing of the angel.” The Imam (a.s.) said, “That made me laugh. I left him that day because of the silliness (dark and dullness) in his intellect and reason. I then met him latter and said to him, “O Ibn ‘Abbas, you have not spoken as true as you did yesterday. Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) told you that the Night of Determination comes every year. On that night the command for the whole year comes down.

    "englishText": "(Prophet (sw) continued); O' Ali (as), the believer is the one whom Muslims trust with their wealth and lives, and the Muslim is the one from whose hand and tongue other Muslims are safe, and the emigrant is the one who abandons sins.\nO' Ali (as), the strongest bond of faith is love for the sake of Allah (swt) and hatred for the sake of Allah (swt).\nO' Ali (as), whoever obeys his wife in matters that lead to disobedience, Allah (swt), the Almighty and Majestic, will throw him on his face into the fire.\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said: \"What kind of obedience is that?\"\nThe Prophet (sw) replied: \"Allowing her to go to public baths, weddings, mourning gatherings, and to wear revealing clothing.\"\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, has abolished the arrogance and pride of pre-Islamic ignorance and its boasting about ancestors. Verily, people are from Adam, and Adam is from dust. The most honorable of them in the sight of Allah (swt) is the most pious.\nO' Ali (as), unlawful earnings include the price of a dead animal, the price of a dog, the price of alcohol, the dowry of a prostitute, a bribe in judgment, and the fee of a soothsayer.\nO' Ali (as), whoever seeks knowledge to argue with the foolish, to debate with scholars, or to draw people to himself, he is among the people of Hellfire.\nO' Ali (as), when a person dies, people ask, \"What has he left behind?\" while the angels ask, \"What has he sent ahead?\"\nO' Ali (as), this world is a prison for the believer and a paradise for the disbeliever.\nO' Ali (as), sudden death is a relief for the believer and a regret for the disbeliever.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, revealed to the world: \"Serve those who serve Me, and exhaust those who serve you.\"\nO' Ali (as), if this world were worth the wing of a mosquito in the sight of Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, He (swt) would not have given the disbeliever even a sip of water from it.\nO' Ali (as), every person from the first to the last will wish on the Day of Judgment that they had received from this world only enough to sustain them.\nO' Ali (as), the worst of people is the one who doubts Allah's (swt) decree.\nO' Ali (as), the groaning of the believer is glorification, his shouting is the declaration of God's oneness, his sleep on his bed is worship, and his turning from side to side is striving in the way of Allah (swt). If he recovers, he walks among the people without a sin upon him.\nO' Ali (as), if I were given a leg of meat as a gift, I would accept it, and if I were invited to partake of a leg of meat, I would respond.\nO' Ali (as), women are not required to attend the Friday prayer, congregational prayers, call to prayer, Iqama, visiting the sick, following funeral processions, running between Safa and Marwa, touching the Black Stone, shaving the head, taking up judicial positions, being consulted, slaughtering animals except in necessity, raising their voices in the Talbiyah, standing by graves, listening to sermons, arranging their own marriages, or leaving their husband's house without his permission. If she leaves without his permission, Allah (swt), Jibril, and Mikaeel will curse her. She should not give away anything from her husband's house without his consent, nor should she sleep while he is displeased with her, even if he is unjust to her.\nO' Ali (as), Islam is naked; its clothing is modesty, its adornment is loyalty, its dignity is righteous deeds, and its foundation is piety. Everything has a foundation, and the foundation of Islam is love for us, the Ahlulbayt (as).\nO' Ali (as), bad character is an ill omen, and obeying a woman leads to regret.\nO' Ali (as), if there is ill fortune in anything, it is in the tongue of a woman.\nO' Ali (as), those who carry little burden are saved.\nO' Ali (as), whoever deliberately lies about me, let him prepare his seat in the Fire.\nO' Ali (as), three things increase memory and remove phlegm: chewing frankincense, using the miswak, and reciting the Quran.\nO' Ali (as), the miswak is part of the Sunnah; it purifies the mouth, enhances eyesight, pleases the Most Merciful, whitens the teeth, removes tartar, strengthens the gums, increases appetite, eliminates phlegm, boosts memory, multiplies good deeds, and brings joy to the angels.\nO' Ali (as), sleep is of four types: the sleep of the prophets, peace be upon them, is on their backs; the sleep of the believers is on their right sides; the sleep of the disbelievers and hypocrites is on their left sides; and the sleep of the devils is on their faces.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Almighty and Exalted, did not send any prophet except that He (swt) made his progeny from his own loins, but He (swt) made my progeny from your loins. If it were not for you (as), I (sw) would have had no descendants.\nO' Ali (as), four things break a person's back: a leader who disobeys Allah (swt), yet his orders are followed; a wife who is protected by her husband yet betrays him; poverty that leaves a person without treatment; and a bad neighbour in a permanent residence.\nO' Ali (as), indeed Abdul Muttalib (as), peace be upon him, established five practices during the era of ignorance (Jahiliyyah), which Allah (swt), the Almighty, continued in Islam.\nHe prohibited the wives of fathers for their sons, and Allah (swt), the Almighty, revealed: \"And do not marry women whom your fathers married.\"\nHe discovered a treasure and took out a fifth of it and gave it in charity, and Allah (swt), the Almighty, revealed: \"And know that whatever you obtain of war booty - then indeed, for Allah (swt) is one-fifth of it and for the Messenger...\"\nWhen he dug the well of Zamzam, he named it the provision for the pilgrims, and Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, revealed: \"Have you made the providing of water for the pilgrim and the maintenance of Al-Masjid Al-Haram equal to [the deeds of] the one who believes in Allah (swt) and the Last Day?\"\nO' Ali (as), Abdul Muttalib established the practice of a hundred camels as blood money for killing, and Allah (swt), the Almighty, continued this practice in Islam.\nThere was no fixed number for circumambulation (Tawaf) among the Quraysh, but Abdul Muttalib prescribed seven circuits for them, and Allah (swt), the Almighty, continued this practice in Islam.\nO' Ali (as), Abdul Muttalib never practiced divination by arrows, nor did he worship idols, nor eat anything slaughtered on stone altars, and he used to say: \"I am on the religion of my father Ibrahim, peace be upon him.\"\nO' Ali (as), the most astonishing people in faith and the greatest in certainty will be those who live in the end times; they will not have met the Prophet (sw) nor seen the proof, yet they will believe based on black lines on white paper.\nO' Ali (as), three things harden the heart: listening to idle talk, excessive hunting, and approaching the doors of rulers.\nO' Ali (as), do not pray in the skin of animals whose milk you do not drink and whose meat you do not eat. Do not pray in places known as Dhat Al-Jaysh, Dhat Al-Salasil, or Dhajnan.\nO' Ali (as), eat from eggs that have different ends, from fish that have scales, and from birds that flap their wings when they fly; avoid those that glide. Eat from water birds that have a crop or spurs.\nO' Ali (as), every predatory animal with fangs and every bird with talons is forbidden to eat; do not consume them.\nO' Ali (as), there is no punishment for stealing fruit or palm shoots.\nO' Ali (as), there is no blood money for a fornicator, no punishment for insinuation, no intercession in prescribed punishments, and no oath in severing family ties. A child cannot take an oath against their parent, nor can a wife against her husband, nor a servant against his master. There is no fasting from morning until night, no continuous fasting, and no reverting to a life of ignorance after migration.\nO' Ali (as), a parent is not to be executed for killing their child.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt) does not accept the supplication of a heedless heart.\nO' Ali (as), the sleep of a scholar is better than the worship of a devoted worshiper.\nO' Ali (as), two units of prayer offered by a scholar are better than a thousand units offered by a worshiper.\nO' Ali (as), a woman should not observe voluntary fasting without her husband's permission, nor should a servant without their master's permission, nor should a guest without the host's permission.\nO' Ali (as), fasting on the day of Eid Al-Fitr is forbidden, fasting on the day of Eid Al-Adha is forbidden, continuous fasting is forbidden, silence fasting is forbidden, fasting as a vow for sin is forbidden, and perpetual fasting is forbidden.\nO' Ali (as), there are six consequences of fornication: three in this world and three in the Hereafter. As for those in this world, it takes away dignity, hastens death, and cuts off sustenance. As for those in the Hereafter, they result in a difficult reckoning, the wrath of the Merciful, and eternal punishment in the Fire.\nO' Ali (as), usury consists of seventy parts, the least of which is like a man committing fornication with his mother in the sacred House of Allah (swt).\nO' Ali (as), one dirham gained through usury is greater in sin before Allah (swt) than seventy acts of fornication, all with a forbidden relative, in the sacred House of Allah (swt).\nO' Ali (as), whoever withholds even a small portion of the zakat due on his wealth is neither a believer nor a Muslim, and he has no honor.\nO' Ali (as), the one who neglects zakat will plead to Allah (swt) for a return to the world, as Allah (swt) the Almighty says: \"Until, when death comes to one of them, he says, My Lord (azj), send me back.'\"\nO' Ali (as), whoever is capable of performing Hajj and does not do so is considered a disbeliever, as Allah (swt) the Exalted says: \"And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto Allah (swt) for mankind, for him who can find a way there. And whoever disbelieves, then verily Allah (swt) is Independent of all creation.\"\nO' Ali (as), whoever postpones Hajj until he dies, Allah (swt) will resurrect him on the Day of Judgment as a Jew or a Christian.\nO' Ali (as), charity repels decrees that have been firmly established.\nO' Ali (as), maintaining ties of kinship increases lifespan.\nO' Ali (as), begin your meals with salt and end with salt, for it is a cure for seventy-two diseases.\nO' Ali (as), if I were to stand at the Praised Station (maqam Al Mahmoud), I would intercede for my father (as), my mother {s.a}, my uncle (as), and a brother (as) I had in the pre-Islamic era.\nO' Ali (as), I am the son of the two sacrifices.\nO' Ali (as), I am the answer to the supplication of my father Ibrahim.\nO' Ali (as), intellect is that by which Paradise is attained and the pleasure of the Most Merciful is sought.\nO' Ali (as), the first creation that Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, created was the intellect. He (swt) said to it, \"Come forward,\" and it came forward. Then He (swt) said: \"Go back,\" and it went back.

(Surah Al-A'raf 7:54)\nO' Ali (as), the right of the child upon his father is that he gives him a good name, teaches him good manners, and places him in a righteous environment. The right of the father upon his child is that he should not call him by his name, should not walk ahead of him, should not sit before him, and should not enter the bathhouse with him.\nO' Ali (as), three things are from whispers of Shaytan: eating clay, biting nails with teeth, and consuming one's beard.\nO' Ali (as), may Allah (swt) curse parents who lead their child to disobey them.\nO' Ali (as), parents are responsible for the disobedience of their children in the same way that children are responsible for disobeying their parents.\nO' Ali (as), may Allah (swt) have mercy on parents who encourage their children to be righteous to them.\nO' Ali (as), whoever saddens his parents has indeed disobeyed them.\nO' Ali (as), whoever hears his Muslim brother being backbitten and has the ability to defend him but does not, Allah (swt) will forsake him in this world and the Hereafter.\nO' Ali (as), whoever provides for an orphan with his wealth until the orphan becomes self-sufficient, Paradise is assured for him without doubt.\nO' Ali (as), whoever passes his hand over an orphan's head out of compassion, Allah (swt) will grant him a light for every hair he touched on the Day of Judgment.\nO' Ali (as), there is no poverty worse than ignorance, no wealth more beneficial than intelligence, no loneliness worse than arrogance, no intellect like planning, no piety like refraining from what Allah (swt) has forbidden, no nobility like good character, and no worship like contemplation.\nO' Ali (as), the flaw of speech is lying, the flaw of knowledge is forgetfulness, the flaw of worship is laziness, the flaw of beauty is arrogance, and the flaw of knowledge is envy.\nO' Ali (as), four things are wasted in vain: eating when already full, lighting a lamp under the moonlight, planting crops in barren land, and doing a favor for those who are unworthy of it.\nO' Ali (as), whoever forgets to send blessings upon me has indeed lost the path to Paradise.\nO' Ali (as), beware of the pecking of the crow and the swooping of the lion.\nO' Ali (as), placing my hand inside the mouth of a dragon up to my elbow is more beloved to me than asking from someone who was nothing and then became something.\nO' Ali (as), the most rebellious people against Allah (swt), the Almighty, are those who kill someone other than their killer, strike someone other than their attacker, and those who align themselves with other than their rightful leaders; such a person has indeed disbelieved in what Allah (swt) has revealed to me.\nO' Ali (as), wear the ring on your right hand, for it is a virtue from Allah (swt), the Almighty, for those who are close to Him.\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) asked: \"With what should I wear the ring, O' Messenger of Allah (swt)?\"\nProphet (sw) said: O' Ali (as), wear a ring of red agate, for it was the first mountain to acknowledge Allah's (swt) Lordship (azj), my Prophethood, your successorship, the Imamate of your progeny, Paradise for your followers, and Hellfire for your enemies.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Almighty, looked upon the people of the world and chose Me (sw) from among them over the men of the worlds. Then, He (swt) looked a second time and chose you (as) over the men of the worlds. Then, He (swt) looked a third time and chose the Imams (as) from your (as) progeny over the men of the worlds. Then, He (swt) looked a fourth time and chose (Sayyida) Fatimah {s.a} over the women of the worlds.\nO' Ali (as), I have seen your name paired with mine in three places, and I was comforted by seeing it. When I reached Bayt Al-Maqdis during my ascension to the heavens, I found inscribed on its rock: 'There is no God but Allah (swt), Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (swt). I (swt) have supported Him (sw) with his minister and granted Him (sw) victory through his minister.'\nI (Prophet (sw)) asked Jibril (as): \"Who is my minister?\"\nJibril (as) replied: \"(Imam) Ali ibn Abi Talib (as).\"\n(Prophet (sw) continued); Then, when I reached the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary (Sidrat Al-Muntaha), I found written upon it:\n'Indeed, I am Allah (swt); there is no God but Me (swt) alone.

May Allah (swt) grant you well-being until the end of your appointed term.\"\nThen the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said to Abu Dharr, may Allah (swt) have mercy on him:\n\"O' Abu Dharr, beware of asking from others, for it is an immediate humiliation and hastened poverty, and it brings a lengthy reckoning on the Day of Judgment. O' Abu Dharr, you shall live alone, die alone, and enter Paradise alone. A group of people from Iraq will take care of your washing, shrouding, and burial, and they will be blessed by it.\nO' Abu Dharr, do not ask with your hand, but if something comes to you, accept it.\"\nThen the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said to his companions:\n\"Shall I not inform you of the worst among you?\"\nThey said: \"Indeed, O' Messenger of Allah (swt).\"\nProphet (sw) said: \"Those who walk around spreading gossip, those who create division between loved ones, and those who seek faults in the innocent.\"",

    "englishText": "1.\tWe were told by Abu’l-Abbas, Muhammed bin Ibrahim bin Ishaq al-Talaqani, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Abdul-Aziz bin Yahya al-Jaloudi, that he said: We were told by Hisham bin Ali, and Muhammed bin Zakariya al-Jawhari, that they both said: We were told by Ibn Aisha, with a chain of narrators that he mentioned, that Ali, peace be upon him, was informed that groups of horses (carrying mercenaries belonging) to Mu’awiya reached Anbar and killed a governor in it named Hassaan bin Hassaan. Then he went out, angrily, pulling his robe, until he reached Nakhila, and he was followed by the people. He then went up lofty ground, praised Allah, commended Him and sent blessings upon the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and then said: To proceed, striving is, indeed, a gate from the Gates of Paradise, whom Allah opened to the special ones among His Allies, and that is the garment of godfearness, the protective shield of Allah and His secure tool. Hence, the one who abandons it out of willingness (to something else) away from it, Allah will dress him with the garment of humiliation, the trait of degradation and the coward of the minors. I have, certainly, called you to war against these people, at night and day, in secret and public, and I have said to you: Assault them before they assault you, for by He in whose Hand is my inner self, no people have been assaulted within the core of their homes except that they were humiliated. Then, you did not commit, you drooped, and my saying became heavy upon you, and you took it behind your backs (in neglect), until harries were waged against you. Here is the brother of Ghamid; his horses reached Anbar and they killed Hassaan bin Hassaan, and many men from them, and women. By He in whose Hand is my inner self, it has, certainly, reached me that he would enter into a Muslim and allied (non-Muslim) woman and pull off their anklets and earrings, and then they would leave, having abundance, and none of them would be injured with an injury. If a Muslim individual would die from this out of sorrow, he will not be blameworthy according to me, but rather, he would be worthy of it! How strange, all strangeness, is it of these people to cooperate on their falsehood, and of your failure from (assisting) your truth! If I was to tell you: «Assault them during the winter» you would say: «This is a time of coolness and severe cold», and if I was to tell you: «Assault them during the summer» you would say: «This is (a time of) the severe heat of the summer, so wait for us that the heat might finish from us»! Thus, if you were to flee from heat and cold, then you are, by Allah, more worthy of fleeing from the sword! O you who resemble men, and you are not men, and O masses of boys during puberty, and O you with intellects like those who raise partridges, by Allah, you have, verily, distorted (the reputation of) my ability with your disobedience, and you have, verily, filled my inside with rage, to the extent that Quraish said: «Indeed, the son of Abu Talib is brave, but he has no ability in war». To Allah, how strange are they! And who there is more knowledgeable of it and more intense capability to it than me? For by Allah, I, verily, stood up in it whilst not having reached (the age of) twenty, and today I have become more than sixty. However, there is no opinion (to be executed) for the one who is not obeyed. He said it [1] thrice. Then a man stood up to him, and with him was his brother, and he said: O Commander of the Believers, me and this brother of mine are like what Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said, speaking of Musa: «My Lord, indeed, I do not have other than myself and my brother» (5:25). Hence, command us with your commandment, for by Allah, we shall, verily, adhere to it, even if there was between us and between it (burning) coal of saxaul and thorns of tragacanth. Then he prayed for him for goodness, and then he said: And where are you placed from what I want? Then he, peace be upon him, went down.",

The Qur’an had gathered that for you, so dot open it, and it declared that you should remain in the core (of your home), so do not make it to be in the desert. Indeed, Allah is behind this nation. Certainly, the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, knew your place.

You will be, while you are in that condition, the most obedient you can be to Allah with regards to what He has bound upon you, and (you would be) the most supporting you can be to the Religion, if you were to sit (by abstaining) from it. If I was to remind you of a saying that you know, you would have bit me like the biting of a dotted snake. Aisha then said: How accepting am I to your advice, and how knowledgeable am I of your sincerity. The matter is not as you assume. How good of a march is a march in which two quarreling fractions advanced to me; if I am to sit (by not marching), it will be of no discomfort, and if I am to rise (by marching), it would be towards that which is a must to increase from. Umm Salama then said: If it was adhering strongly from (falling unto) the slip of anyone, Aisha would have the legitimacy to blame the people. How many traditions of Allah’s Messenger have become extinguished, After (the interpretation of)  verses of the Qur’an were extinguished? Allah might remove from a people their intellects, Until it is that which finishes off the head.",

You will be, while you are in that condition, the most obedient you can be to Allah with regards to what He has bound upon you, and (you would be) the most supporting you can be to the Religion, if you were to sit (by abstaining) from it. If I was to remind you of a saying that you know, you would have bit me like the biting of a dotted snake. Aisha then said: How accepting am I to your advice, and how knowledgeable am I of your sincerity. The matter is not as you assume. How good of a march is a march in which two quarreling fractions advanced to me; if I am to sit (by not marching), it will be of no discomfort, and if I am to rise (by marching), it would be towards that which is a must to increase from. Umm Salama then said: If it was adhering strongly from (falling unto) the slip of anyone, Aisha would have the legitimacy to blame the people. How many traditions of Allah’s Messenger have become extinguished, After (the interpretation of)  verses of the Qur’an were extinguished? Allah might remove from a people their intellects, Until it is that which finishes off the head.",

    "author": "Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq",
    "translator": "Sayed Ali Raza Rizvi",
    "englishText": "1. Abu Muhammad Ja`far ibn `Ali ibn Ahmad the jurist resident of Qum then of al-Iylaq (RA‬‬ ‫‪said: Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Ali ibn Sadaqah al-Qummi reported to us‬‬ ‫‪that Abu `Amr Muhammad ibn `Umar ibn `Abd `Aziz al-Ansari al-Kajji related to me that one‬‬ ‫‪who heard from al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali al-Hashimi related to me that‬‬ When `Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS) came to see al-Ma`mun, al-Ma`mun ordered al-Fadl ibn Sahl to summon the prominent theologians from among the rhetoricians such as the Catholicos [al-jathaliq]. The Head of the Rabbis [ra`s al-jalut], the heads of the Sabians, the High Priest [al-hirbidh] of Zoroaster and his followers, Castile Nestus, the Roman medical scientist, and the rest of the theologians in order to hear their words and those of al-Rida (AS). Al-Fadl ibn Sahl gathered them together, then informed al-Ma`mun about their meeting. Al-Ma`mun said: `Let them enter my presence.’ So he did, and then received them with hospitality. He then introduced himself to them saying, `Verily, I have gathered you for something good, and want you to debate with this cousin of mine from medina, who has come tome. Come to me tomorrow morning. None of you should be absent.” They said: “O Commander of the Faithful! We listen and obey you. Allah willing,, we will be here first thing in the morning.” Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said: “We were talking to Abu al-Hasan (AS) when Yasir, the servant who was in the charge of serving Abu al-Hasan, entered and told him, O My Master! Verily, the Commander of the Faithful expressed his greetings to you and said: `May you brother be your ransom! Verily, the rhetoricians, scholars from all religions, and theologians from all nations have all gathered together here with me. Would you like to come to us and have a discussion with them? If you do not wish to do so, do not bother yourself. However, if you prefer, we can come visit you. Abu al-Hasan (AS) then said: “Express my greetings to him, and tell him that I understand what you intend. Allah willing, I will come to you myself tomorrow morning.” Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said; “When Yasir went out, the Imam (AS) turned to me and said: “O Nawfali! You are an Iraqi, and an Iraqi’s heart is not hard. So, what do you think? What is your cousin’s intention in setting up a meeting between me and the pagans and rhetoricians?” Al-Nawfali says I answered, “May I be yoiur ransom! He intends to test you, and wants to know how much knowledge you possess. Verily, he has based his assumption on shaky grounds. By Allah, what he has set up is evil.” The Imam (AS) asked, “And what has he set up?” Al-nawfali said: The heretics and the theologians are different from the learned. That is because a learned does not deny the undeniable, whereas rhetoricians, theologians, and polytheists are people who deny things and try to prove what is not true. If you argue with them and tell them that God is One, they would say, `Confirm His Oneness.’ And if you say that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, they would say, `Prove his Prophethood.’ May I be your ransom! They confuse you and make you disprove your own proofs. They continue to falsify until you back off. Beware of them! May I be your ransom!” Al-Nawfali added, “The Imam (AS) then smiled, and told me, `O Nawfali! Do you fear that they will defeat my arguments?” Al-Nawfali said: `No, by Allah! I have no worries about you. Allah willing, I hope that Allah will make you victorious over them!’ The Imam (AS) asked again, `O Nawfali! Would you like to know when Al-Ma`mun will regret his actions?” He answered, `Yes.’ The Imam (AS) said: When he hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own Torah, with the people of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel with the people of the Psalms quoting their own Psalms, with the Sabians in their own Hebrew language, with the Zoroastrian priests in their own Persian, with the Romans in their own Latin, and with the rhetoricians using their very own languages. So, if I close the avenues of argument in the face of each arguing party and disprove his claim, making him renounce his statement from its onset and referring to my own statement, then al-Ma`mun will realize that he has not achieved what he aspires to achieve. It is then that he will feel regret. And there is no power and no strength save in Allah, the Most High, the Most Great. On the following day, al-Fadl ibn Sahl went in a hurry to see the Imam (AS) and told him, “May I be your ransom! Your cousin is waiting for you. The people have gathered together. When will you go to him?” Al-Rida (AS) told him, “You go ahead, Allah willing, I will come to you.” Then he made ablutions for praying, drank some sawiq, quenched us from it as well, and then we all left. When we reached al-Ma`mun’s place, the meeting was full of people. Muhammad ibn Ja`far, some of the Talibites and Hashimites, and the Commanders of the Army were among those present. When al-Rida (AS) entered, al-Ma`mun stood up, Muhammad ibn Ja`far, and all the Hashimites who were present there, also stood up for him. The Imam (AS) and alMa`mun sat down while all the people were still standing, until al-Ma`mun ordered them to sit down. Al-Ma`mun talked to the Imam for a while. Then al-Ma`mun turned to the Catholicos and said: “O Catholicos! This is my cousin `Ali ibn Musa ibn Ja`far (AS). He is one of the children of Fatimah (AS), the daughter of our Prophet (SA), and `Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS). I would like you to debate with him, but be fair with him.” The Catholicos said: “O Commander of the Faithful! How can I argue with a man who argues with me using a Book I reject, and who believes in a prophet who I do not believe in? Al-Rida (AS) told him, “O Christian! Will you accept to debate with me if I present proofs from your Gospel?” The Catholicos answered, “How could I reject the words of the Bible? I swear to God that I will accept your arguments, even if I dislike them.” Al-Rida (AS) told him, “Ask whatever you wish, and you shall receive an answer.” The Catholicos said: “what is your opinion about the Prophethood of Jesus and his Book? Do you deny either one of them?” Al-Rida (AS) said: I accept the Prophethood of Jesus. I accept his Book. And I accept what he taught his nation, and what was accepted by his disciples. However, I reject the Prophethood of any Jesus who has not professed the Prophethood of Muhammad, his Book, and what he taught his people. The Catholicos said: “Two witnesses are required to validate a testimony. Is that correct?” The Imam (AS) said: “Yes.” The Catholicos Archbishop said: “if that is the case, I challenge you to select who witnesses who are neither Muslim nor Christina, but who do not reject the Prophethood of Muhammad (SA). Likewise, you may ask a similar question from people other than our own nation.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Christian! Now you are speaking fairly. Do you accept a just person who was given preference (over others) by the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary?” The Catholicos replied, “Who is the just one? Name him for me.” The Imam (AS) said: “What is your opinion of John al-Daylami?” The Catholicos responded, “Bravo! Bravo! You have mentioned the person most loved by the Messiah.” The Imam (AS) said: Then I ask you to swear by God, and tell me whether or not the Bible says that John said: `The Messiah has informed me of the religion of Muhammad, the Arab, and has given me the glad tidings about him who will be (a Prophet) after him. Therefore, I have the glad tidings of him to the disciples and they believed in him.’ The Catholicos said: “John did quote this from the Messiah. He did give the glad tidings concerning the coming of a Prophet, his Household, and his Successor. He has not specified when this would happen, and has not named them so that we could identify them.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “If we bring someone here who can recite the Bible, and he recites to you Muhammad’s name, his Household, and his nation, will you believe in him?” The Catholicos replied, “What a sound suggestion!” Al-Rida (AS) turned to Nestus the Roman, and asked hi, “have you memorized the third Book of the Bible?” He answered, “I have thoroughly memorized it.” Then the Imam (AS) addressed the Catholicos and said: “Can you recite the Bible?” The Catholicos said: “Yes, of course.” The Imam said: “Then I will recite to you (some verses from) the third Book. If Muhammad (SA), his Household (AS), and his nation were mentioned in it, then bear witness! And if they have not been mentioned therein, then do not bear witness.” Then the Imam (AS) recited to him some of the verses of the third Book until he reached the reference to the Prophet. He stopped reading and said: “O Christina! I challenge you to swear by the Messiah and his mother. Have you realized that I have knowledge of the Bible?” He replied, “yes.” The Imam (AS) recited to him some verses from the third Book concerning the reference to the Prophet, his Household, and his nation. Then the Imam (AS) said: O Christian! What do you think now? These are the words of Jesus, the son of Mary. If you deny what the Bible says, then you will deny both the Jesus and Moses. If you deny them, then it is incumbent to kill you for blasphemy against your Lord, your Prophet, and your Book. The Catholicos said: “I do not deny the clear things in the Bible. On the contrary, I profess them.” The Imam (AS) asked others who were present, “Bear witness to his profession.” Then the Imam (AS) said to the Catholicos, “O Catholicos! Ask me any other question that you wish to ask.” The Catholicos asked, “What about the disciples of Jesus, the son of Mary? How many were they? And tell me about the scholars of the Bible. How many were then?” Al-Rida (AS) said: You have found the expert! As for (the number of) the disciples, they were twelve men. The best and the most learned of them was Aluqas (Luke). As for the (number of) Christian scholars, there were three men: John (Yohanna), `the great’ at Aj, John at Qirqisiya, and john al-Daylami at Zijan, who made reference to Prophet Muhammad, his Household and his nation. It is he who gave glad tidings to the nation of Jesus and the Children of Israel about him. The Imam (AS) added, “O Christian! By Allah, we believe in Jesus, who believed in Muhammad. We have nothing against Jesus except for his weakness and the paucity of his fasting and prayer. The Catholicos replied, “By Allah, you have corrupted your knowledge! You affair has become weak! I though that you were the most learned of the Muslims!” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “Why?” The Catholicos said: “You said that Jesus was weak in fasting and prayer when, in fact, he never broke fasting during the day, and never slept during the night. He always fasted during the day, and he always prayed throughout the night.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “For whom did he fast and pray?” The Catholicos did no answer, not knowing what to say. Al-Rida (AS) said: “I want to ask you a question.” The Catholicos said: “Ask. I will respond if I have the answer.” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “Why do you deny that Jesus gave life to the dead with the permission of Allah, the Mighty and High?” The Catholicos said: “I deny that because whoever is able to give life to the dead, and to heal the blind and the leprous is a Lord worthy of service.” Al-Rida (AS) said: Very well. However, Elijah [al-Yasa’] performed the same miracles as Jesus did. He walked on water, gave life to the dead, and healed the blind and the leprous Why did his nation not adopt him as a Lord? Why did no anyone worship him as a god other than Allah? The Prophet Ezekiel [Hizqil] did just what Jesus did. He gave life to thirty-five men sixty years after their death. Then the Imam (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and asked him, O Head of the Rabbis! Do you find the following about some of the youth of the Children of Israel in the Torah? When Nebuchadnezzar [Bakht Nasr] invaded Jerusalem, he enslaved the Children of Israel and brought them to Babylonia. Then Allah, the Mighty and High, sent al-Yasa` from them, and he gave life to them. This is in the Torah. No one but an unbeliever of you would deny it. The Head of the Rabbis said: “I have heard about this and know it.” The Imam (AS) said: “You have spoken the truth.” Then the Imam (AS) said: “O Jewish man! See if I read from the following Book of the Torah properly.” The Imam (AS) then recited some of the verses from the Torah for us. The Jewish man, who was surprised at hearing how the Imam (AS) was reciting the Torah, kept moving his body. He then faced the Christian and asked, “O Christian! Were these words revealed before Jesus or were they revealed after him?” The Catholicos answe3red, “They were revealed before him.” Al-Rida (AS) said: The people of Quraysh gathered around the Messenger of Allah (SA) and asked him to give life to their dead. He sent along `Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) with them and told him, “go to the cemetery, and loudly call the people about whom they have asked, say, “O soand-so, so-and-so, etc.” Tell them, “Allah’s Messenger Muhammad says, `Rise with the permission of Allah, the Mighty and High’ Then they all rose and brushed off the dust from their heads.” The people from the tribe of Quraysh walked towards them and asked them about their affairs. They told them that Muhammad (SA) has been raised as a Prophet. The people who had risen from the dead said: “We wish we had lived in his age and believed in him!” He healed the blind, the leprous, and the insane. He spoke with the beasts, the birds, the jinn, and demons. Still, we do not adopt him as a Lord other than Allah, the Mighty and High. We do not deny the miracles of the prophets. Since you have adopted Jesus as a Lord, why do you not adopt al-Yasa` and Hizqil as lords, for they performed the same miracles as did Jesus, the son of Mary, such as giving life to the dead? Moreover, thousands of the Children of Israel left their homeland in fear of death due to the plague. Allah made them die immediately. The people of the village build a fence around them, and left them there until their bones decayed. One of the prophets of the Children of Israel passed by, and he was amazed when he saw so may decayed bones. Allah, the Mighty and high, revealed to him, “Would you like Me to bring them to life so that you can admonish them?” The Prophet said: “Yes, O Lord!” Then Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to him, “Then call them.” He said: “O decayed bones! Rise with Allah’s permission.” They all rose while brushing off the dust from their heads.” Likewise when Abraham (AS), the friend of the Most Compassionate, took the birds, cut them into pieces, and put each piece on a mountain top. He called out to them and they came towards him. Also Moses (AS) the son of `Imran, his companions, and seventy of the men whom he had chosen went to the mountain. They told Moses, “You have seen Allah. So show Him to us like you have seen Him.” Moses told them, “I have not seen Him.” But they said: “We shall never believe in you until we see Allah manifestly.” A thunderbolt struck them, and burned them all up. Only Moses survived. Moses said: `O my Lord! I chose seventy men from among the Children of Israel and brought them to the mountain. Shall I return by myself? How shall my people believe what I must tell them? If You desired You could have destroyed al of us long before. Would you destroy us all for the deeds of the foolish ones among us?’ Then Allah, the Mighty and High, gave life to them after their death. You cannot deny all these things which I have told you, for the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms and the Qur’an have mentioned them. If all those who gave life to the dead, healed the blind, the leprous and the mad, were adopted as lords other than Allah, then you should also adopt them as Lords. O Christians! What is your opinion? The Catholicos said: “Yes. You are right. There is no god but Allah.” Then the Imam (AS) turned towards the Head of Rabbis and told him. O Jewish man! Turn to me. Swear to me by the Ten Commandments which were sent down to Moses, the son of `Imran, that the following statement about the Prophet Muhammad (SA) and his nation is not found in the Torah: When the people of the last nation, who are followers of the Rider of the Camel, who glorifies the Lord enormously, new glorification in new churches (implying mosques), then let the Children of Israel flee towards them and their dominion so that their hearts may be tranquil, since there will be swords in their hands with which they will take revenge on the unbelievers around the globe. Is this not written in the Torah? The Head of the Rabbis said; “Yes, we have found that written in this manner.” Then the Imam (AS) asked the Catholicos, “O Christian! How is your knowledge of the Book of Sha`ya? He answered, “I know it letter by letter.” Then the Imam asked them both, “Do you know that the following statement is made by him, `O people! I have seen the picture of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel, who is as bright as the moon.’” They answered, “Verily, Sha`1ya did say that!” Al-Rida (AS) said: O Christian! Do you know that Jesus said: `I am going to my Lord and your Lord, and the Paraclete [farqilita] is coming who shall testify to my truth just as I testified for him, and he shall explain everything to you, and he shall be the one to expose all the sins of nations, and he shall be the one to smash down the pillars of unbelief?’ The Catholicos said: “We accept whatever you cite from the Bible.” The Imam said: “O Catholicos! Have you found this in the Bible?” The Catholicos said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Catholicos, when you lost the first Bible, with whom did you find it?” The Catholicos said: “We only lost the Bible for one day. Then we found it fresh (in its original state). John and Matthew brought it back to us.” Al-Rida (AS) asked him, How little you know of the Bible and its scholars! If what you say is correct, then why do you have so many disputes between yourselves regarding the Bible? The source of controversy lies in the Bible which you have in your hands today. Had it been the same as the fist Bible, there would be no dispute over it, However, I will prove this for you myself. Know that when the first Bible was lost, the Christians gathered around their scholars and said to them, `Jesus the son of Mary has been killed, and we have lost the Bible. You are the scholars. What do you have?’ Luke, Mark and John told them, `We have memorized the Bible. Do not worry about it. Do not forsake the churches. We will recite each Gospel of the Bible for you on each Sunday until we put it all together.’ Then Luke, Mark, John and Matthew gathered together and put together this Bible after you had lost the first one. These four students were of the first students. Did you know that?” The Catholicos said: “I did not know this before. Now I have learned it from you due to your noble knowledge of the Bible. I heard things from you which I knew deep down, and which my heart acknowledges to be the truth. As a result, I have grown in understanding.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Do you accept the evidence I have presented?” The Catholicos said: “I completely accept the evidence as correct, and bear witness that it is true.” Al-Rida (AS) then told al-Ma’mun, his family, and the others who were present, “Be witnesses to this.” They said: “We bear witness.” Then the Imam (AS) told the Catholicos, I swear by the Son and his Mother to tell us whether you know that Matthew said the following, `The Messiah is the son of David, the son of Abraham, the son of Issac, the son of Jacob, the son of Yehuda, the son of Khadrun.’ Mark said the following regarding the lineage of Jesus, the son of Mary, `He is Allah’s Word placed in the human body. So it turned into the human form.’ Moreover, Luke said: `Jesus the son of Mary and his mother wee humans made of flesh and blood. Then the Holy Sprit entered into them.’ Testify as well that Jesus said the following about himself, `O disciples! I will tell you the truth. No one will ascend to Heaven, except for him who descends there from, except for the Rider of the Camel, the Seal of the Prophets, for he will ascend to the Heavens, and then will descend therefrom. What do you have to say about that? The Catholicos said; “These are the words of Jesus. We do not deny them.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “If so, what do you say about the testimonies of Luke, Mark and Matthew regarding Jesus and the lineage they attributed to him?” The Catholicos said: “They ascribed likes to Jesus.” Al-Rida (A) said: “O people! Did he not just bear witness that they (Luke, Mark and Matthew) are the Scholars of the Bible, and what they said was the truth?” The Catholicos said: “O Scholar of the Muslims! I would like you to excuse me from discussing about these men.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Fine, I will excuse you from that, O Christian! Ask me whatever you wish to ask.” The Catholicos said: “Let someone else ask you questions. By Jesus, I did not think that there was a scholar like you among the Muslims.” Al-Rida (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and said: “Will you ask me questions or should I ask?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “I will ask. However, I will not accept any proofs from you except those form the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms of David, or the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Do not accept any of my proofs unless they are from the Torah as expressed by Moses, the son of `Imran, the Bible as expressed by Jesus, the son of Mary, or the Psalms of David as expressed by David.” The Head of the Rabbis said: “How can you prove the Prophethood of Muhammad (SA)?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Moses, the son of `Imran, Jesus, the son of Mary and David, the Vicegerent of Allah on the Earth, have testified to his Prophethood.” The Head of the Rabbis said: “Provide evidence of the testimony of Moses, the son of `Imran.” Al-Rida (AS) told him, O Jewish man! Do you know that Moses said the following to the Children of Israel, `A prophet will come to you fro among your brethren. Believe in him, and obey him.’ Do you know that the Children of Israel have no brethren other than the Children of Ishamel? Do you know about the ties of kinship between Israel and Ishmael and the relationship that existed between them from the past through Abraham? The Head of the Rabbis said: “These are the words of Moses. I do not deny them.” Al-Rida (AS) asked him, “Has any Prophet other than Muhammad (SA) come from among the brethren of the Children of Israel?” He replied, “No.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Is this not correct in your opinion?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “Yes, but I want you to prove its correctness from the Torah.” Al-Rida (AS) asked him, “Do you deny that the Toray says the following to you? `There came light from Mount Sinai. Light shined upon us from Mount Sa`ir and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran.’” The Head of the Rabbis said: “I am familiar with these words, but I do not know what they mean.” Al-Rida (AS) said: I will inform you about them. What is meant when it says `There came light from Mount Sinai` is a reference to the revelations of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, to Moses on mount Sinai. And what is meant when it says, `Light shined upon us from Mount Sa`ir’ is a reference to the mountain upon which Allah, the Mighty and High, sent revelations of Jesus, the son of Mary. Jesus was on that mountain. And what is meant when it says, `and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran.’ Faran is a mountain that is one day away from Mecca. As you and your friends said: the Prophet Sha`ya has said in the Torah that `I have seen the picture of the Rider of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel, who is as bright as the moon.’ Who is the Rider of the Donkey? Who is the Rider of the Camel? The Head of the Rabbis said: “I do not know who they are.” The Imam (AS) said: “The Rider of the Donkey is Jesus, and the Rider of the Camel is Muhammad (SA). Do you deny that this is from the Torah?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “No, I do not deny that.” Then al-Rida (AS) said: “Do you know the Prophet Hayqua?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “Yes, I know him.” The Imam (AS) said: He said the following which your Book has also stated, `Allah brought down the Bayan from Mount Faran. The heavens are filled with the praise of Ahmad and his nation. He will lead his troops at sea just as he carries them on land. He will bring us a new Book after the destruction of the Holy House (in Jerusalem).’ Did you know the, and do you believe in it? The Head of the Rabbis said: “In fact, the Prophet Hayquq has said this. I will not deny his words. Al-Rida (AS) said: David said in his Psalms which you have also read, `O my Allah! Appoint him who will establish the practice after the cessation (of the prophets). Did you know of any prophet other than Muhammad (SA) who has established the practice after the end of the period of prophecy? The Head of the Rabbis said: “this is what David said. We do not deny it. However, he was referring to Jesus, as it was with him that the age of prophecy came to a close.” Al-Rida (AS) told him, You are wrong. In fact, Jesus endorsed the practices [sunah] of the Torah until Allah raised him up to Himself. It is written in the Bible. The son of the pious woman will go, and the Paraclete will come after him. It is he who will preserve the bonds, explain everything to you, and testify to my truth just as I testified for him. I have brought you the examples, and he will bring you the interpretations. Do you believe that this statement is in the Bible? The Head of the Rabbis said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) replied to him, “O the Head of the Rabbis! I want to ask you about your Prophet Moses.” The Jewish man said: “He brought miracles which the prophets before him had not brought.” The Imam (AS) asked, “Could you give me an example?” The Head of the Rabbis replied, “He split the sea, turned the cane into a slithering serpent, made springs gush from stones, showed his hand white and shining to the onlookers, and other signs the like of which other creatures were unable to bring.” Al-Rida (AS) replied to him, “You are right. They are proofs of his Prophethood. He brought the like of which other creatures were unable to brig. Is it obligatory on you to believe in whoever claims Prophethood, and performs something which all other creatures are unable to perform?” The head of the Rabbis said: “No, since there is no one like Moses considering his position near his Lord and his closeness to Him. It is not incumbent upon us to profess the Prophethood of whoever claims it, unless he brings us miracles similar to those brought by Moses. The Imam (AS) said: Then how come you admit the Prophethood of the other prophets who preceded Moses who did not split the sea; nor did they make twelve springs gush forth from the stones, nor did they show a white shining hand as Moses did, nor did they turn the came into a slithering serpent. The Jewish man replied: I told you that if they performed miracles as evidence for their Prophethood which all other creatures were unable to perform, and if they brought something the like of which Moses had brought, or they followed what Moses had brought, then it is incumbent upon us to believe in them. Al-Rida (AS) replied to him, “O Head of the Rabbis! What has prevented you from professing (the Prophethood of) Jesus, the son of Mary? Jesus brought the dead to life, healed the blind and the leprous, made birds formed of clay and breathed life into them with Allah’s permission.’” The Head of the Rabbis said: “It is said that he did that but we did not see it.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Have you seen the miracles performed by Moses? Have you not received the news by way of Moses’s closest trustworthy companions who said he did them?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “Yes. That is so.” The Imam (AS) said: “Well. The news about the miracles of Jesus, the son of Mary, have reached you in a similar fashion. Why then did you acknowledge Moses and believe in him, but you did not believe in Jesus?” The Head of the Rabbis did not answer. Al-Rida (AS) said: The same is true about Muhammad (SA) and his miracles. The same is true about any other prophet (AS) appointed by Allah. One of the miracles of Muhammad (SA) was that he was a poor hired shepherd. He had not been taught anything. He did not have any teachers. However, the Qur’an which he brought contains the stories of the prophets and the associated news letter by letter. It has narrated news of the past, and the things to come in the future all the way up until the Day of Resurrection. The Qur’an provided information about what people did in hiding or in their homes. The Prophet brought innumerable miracles. The Head of the Rabbis said: “Neither the account about Jesus nor that about Muhammad (SA) is considered correct by us. It is not permissible to admit their Prophethood through what is not correct.” Al-Rida (AS said: “Has the witness who testified for Jesus (AS) and Muhammad (SA) then given false testimony?” The Head of the Rabbis did not answer him. Then the Imam (AS) called the Zoroastrian High Priest. Al-Rida (AS) said to him, “Let me know about Zoroaster who considered himself to be a prophet. What is your proof of his Prophethood?” The Zoroastrian High Priest said: “He performed miracles which no one ever had performed before him. Of course, I have not seen him, but the stories of our ancestors tell us that he made legitimate for us things which others had not made legitimate. Therefore, we follow him.” The Imam (AS) asked, “You believed in the stories which came to you about him, so you followed him, did you not?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: This is the case with all other nations. Stories came to them about what the prophets had accomplished, and what Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (AS) had all brought to them. So why did you not believe in any of these prophets, having believed in Zoroaster through the stories that came to you about him saying that he brought forth what others did not? The Zoroastrian High Priest froze in his place. Then al-Rida (AS) said: “O people! If any of you is opposed to Islam, and wants to ask me any questions, then they should ask me and not be shy.” `Imran the Sabian, who was an expert in theology, stood up and said: O Scholar of the people! I would not have asked you any questions if you had not invited me to ask. I have been to Kufa, Basra, Syria, and Algeria. There I have met many theologians. However, none of them have been able to establish for me the proof that there is One who has no second other than Him, and that he is One Sole Being. Will you permit me to ask you this question? Al-Rida (AS) said: “If `Imran the Sabian is present among the people here, it must be you.” He said: “Yes. It is I.” The Imam (AS) said: “O `Imran! Ask, but I advise you to be fair. Avoid vain talk and nonsense.” `Imran said: “My Master! By Allah, I just want you to prove something which I can adhere to for me. Then I need not seek anything else.” The Imam (AS) said: “Ask whatever you wish to ask.” The crowds moved closer to `Imran and crowded in on him. `Imran the Sabian asked, “let me know of the first thing and what it created.” Al-Rida (AS) replied to him. You asked. Now try to understand. As for the One. He has always been One Being. He has no limits nor does He have transient qualities. He will always remain so. Then, without precedence, He created a different creature with transient qualities and various different limits. He neither places it in anything, not did He limit it by anything. He neither created it like anything, nor did He create other things like it. He then created the creatures in various shapes: pure and impure, different and alike, with various colors, flavors and tastes. He did not create them out of a need for them, nor did He create them to attain a higher rank. He did not sense any increase or decrease in Himself due to this creation. O `Imran! Do you understand this? `Imran said: “By Allah, yes my Master!” The Imam (AS) added, O `Imran! Know that if He had created what He created due to His need for them, then He would have only created things by which He could fulfill His need. In that case, it would have been better for Him to create several times more than what He created, since the more the helpers there were, the more powerful their master would be. O `Imran! In that case, His need would be a never-ending one. The more He would crate, the more newer needs would appear for Him. That is why we say that He did not create the creatures out of need. Through creation He transfers the needs of some of them to others. And He makes some of them nobler than others without any need of the nobler one or without wanting to take any revenge against those whom He had abased. That is how He has created. `Imran asked, “My Master! Was the Being known to Himself by His Own Self?” Al-Rida (AS) said: Knowledge of something is required to distinguish it from other things, and to prove its existence through what is negated about it. However, there was nothing else there to oppose Him to make it necessary to negate. Since there was only Him, there was no need to establish limits. O `Imran Do you understand? `Imran said: “Yes, by Allah, my Master! Then tell me: Through what means did He come to know what He knew. Was it done by conscience or by something else?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “If His Knowledge was acquired through conscience. Can we place any limit to His Conscience, which will end in recognition? `Imran answered, “there is no way out.” The Imam (AS) then asked him, “Then what is that conscience?” `Imran could not provide any answer. Al-Rida (AS) said: Never mind. O `Imran! If I now ask you about that conscience and whether you can recognize it through another conscience, an you answer in the affirmative, have you not then disproved your own statement and claim? O `Imran! Is it not more proper for you to know that the One cannot be described by a conscience? And that the most that can be said about Him is that He has done something, or created something? He is not such that one can conceive any directions or parts for Him as can be imagined for the creatures and their parts. Understand this and base your proper knowledge on it. `Imran asked, “O my Master! Can you let me know what types of limits His creatures have? What are their meanings? And how many varieties of creatures has He created?” The Imam (AS) said: You asked. Now understand. In fact, there are six types of limits for His Creatures. These are the unsubtle; the weighable; the visible; those that have no weight, that is, the spirit; those that are visible but are without any weight, are untouchable, subtle, colorless, and tasteless; and the measurable that are the widths, the forms, width and height. Included among them are deeds and movements which make things, act upon them, change them from one state to another, increase them or reduce them. As for deeds and movements, they pass by since they have no more time than that which is ordained for their need. Whenever a deed is finished and the movement is stopped it ends, but its effects remain just like talking, which ends but its effect remains. `Imran said: “O my Master! Will you let me know about the Creator? If He is One, there is nothing other than Him, and there is nothing with Him, has He not changed (His Essence) by creating the creatures?” Al-Rida (AS) told him, “The Mighty and High does not change through the creation of creatures. The creatures, however, change, due to the changes He has subjected them to.” `Imran asked, “O my Master! By means of what can we recognize Him\u003E” Al-Rida (AS) said: “By means of other than Him.” `Imran asked, “What is other than Him,” Al-Rida (AS) said: “His Will, His Name, His Attribute, and everything else that was created, has emerged and is managed (by Him).” `Imran said: “O my Master! Then what is He?” The Imam (AS) replied, “He is Light. That means that He guided His Creatures from among the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. You have no rights incumbent upon me more than my professing His Unity to you.” `Imran said: “O my Master! Was He not silent before creating the creatures, and then He spoke?” Al-Rida (AS) said: Silence doe not exist unless there is some utterance before it. An example of this is that it is not said that the lamp is silent and does not utter; not is it said that the lamp shines, implying that it want to do something to us. The light shining from the lamp is not considered to be the act of the lamp. It is not something separate from the lamp. Therefore, when it is illuminating us we say that it was lit for us, by which we found our way around. Through this example you can find what you are after and become enlightened in your affairs. `Imran said: “O my Master! I though that the Ever-Existent changed His State through the act of creation.” Al-Rida (AS) said: O `Imran! You claim that the Ever-Existent Being can change in some way as a result of His Action. O `Imran! Have you ever seen that the changes in fire change it? Have you ever seen heat burn itself? Have you ever seen an eye see itself? `Imran said: “No, I have not. O my Master! Will you let me know whether He is in the creatures or the creatures are in Him?” Al-Rida (AS) said: O `Imran! He is greater than that. He is not in the creatures; not are the creatures in Him. He is Exalted above that. I will teach you what you do not know. There is no power and no strength save Allah. Tell me about the mirror: are you in it or is it in you? O `Imran! If neither one of you are in the other; then, how can you see your reflection in it? `Imran said; “Through the light between me and the mirror.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Can you see more light in the mirror than what you perceive with your own eyes?” He answered, “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Then show it to us!” It was then that the man was too baffled to say a word. The Imam (AS) said: “I do not see the light except that it leads to both of you, the mirror and yourself, without being in either one of you. There are many more examples which the ignorant simply cannot comprehend. Allah is the highest such example.” Then the Imam (AS) turned to al-Ma`mun and told him, “It is time to pray.” `Imran said: “O my Master! Do not interrupt my questions since I am feeling inclined towards you in my heart.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “We will pray and come back.” Then the Imam (AS) stood up. Al-Ma`mun got up as well. Al-Rida (AS) prayed inside and the people prayed outside, led by Muhammad ibn Ja`far. Then the Imam (AS) came out, returned to the meeting called out to `Imran, and said: “O `Imran! Ask your questions.” `Imran said: “O my Master! Will you let me know whether the Unity of Allah, the Mighty and High, is perceived through reality or through description?” Al-Rida (AS) said: Certainly, Allah is the Only Initiator and the first Ever-Being. He has always been One without anything to accompany Him. He is the Peerless, and there is no second with Him. He is neither definite nor indefinite. He is neither decisive nor allegorical. He is neither mentioned nor forgotten. No name can describe Him. Time cannot measure His beginning. And time cannot measure His End. He has not been standing upon anything else, nor will He be standing upon anything. There is nothing which supports Him. There is nothing on which He leans. He has all these attributes before creating anything, when there was nothing but Him. Whatever you attribute to Him will be originated attributes which are the only means for understanding Him, which anyone possessing understanding can comprehend. Know that innovation, will, and intent are different words that express the same meaning. His foremost innovation, intent and will were the letters which He established as the origin of everything, the evidence for all perceived things, and the separator for all vague things. Everything was separated by these letters; thing such as the names for right and wrong, action and object, meaning and meaningless. All affairs were run based on them. He did not establish any limited meaning for them other than what they were themselves when He originated the letters. He did not establish for them any existence other than themselves since they were originated via innovation. Light is Allah’s first action. He is the Light of the heavens and the earth. It was through that action that the letters became object. They are the letters upon which speech is based. Expressions are all from Allah, the Mighty and High, who taught them to His Creatures. There are thirty-three letters. Twenty-eight of them are the letters on which the Arabic language is based. Twenty-two of Twenty-eight letters show the letters of the Assyrian and Hebrew languages. Five of them were separated, and are in the rest of the languages of non-Arabs in the regions. These are the five letters which were separated from the twenty-eight letters. Therefore, there are thirty-three letters. It is not permissible to mention more about them than what we have mentioned regarding these fie letters which were separated. He then established the letters after counting them and numbering them as His own action, like the Word of the Mighty and High: `Be,’ and it is. Here `be’ refers to His Creation, and `what is created’ refers to the creature. Thus, the first creation by Allah, the Mighty and High, is innovation which has neither weight nor any movement. It is neither heard nor does it have color or touch. And the second thing that was created are the letters which have neither weight nor color. They are neither heard nor described. They are not visible. The third creature includes all the various kinds of things which are perceptible, touchable, tasteable, and visible. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, existed before innovation as there has been nothing before the Mighty and High, and nothing with him. Innovation was created before the letters were created, and the letters do not indicate anything other than themselves. Al-Ma`mun asked, “How come they do not indicate anything other than themselves?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, never combines any of them together unless to mean something, When He combines several letters together, say four, five or six or more, He uses them to originate a new meaning which did not exist before.” `Imran asked, “How can we understand them?” Al-Rida (AS) said: This is how it can be understood. When you only want to refer to the letters and not anything else, you mention them one by one and say, a b c d … to the end. Here you find no meaning in them other than themselves. But when you put several letters together y construct names and attributes for a meaning which you have in mind. They will not demonstrate the meaning for which they were intended. Did you understand this? `Imran said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: Know that an attribute cannot be without what it describes. Also, a name cannot be without a meaning. A limit cannot be without the limited. All attributes and names indicate perfection and existence. They do not indicate encompassment, as the limits do. Limits make squares, make triangles, and make hexagons. Verily, the recognition of Allah, the Mighty and High, is perceived by attributes and names, not by limits such as length, width, smallness, largeness, color, weight, and the like. No such limits are applicable to Allah, the High and the All-Holy, so that His creatures could recognize Him by recognizing themselves. This is certain as I said: but the attributes of Allah, the Mighty and High, prove Him. He can be understood through His Names. He can be reasoned upon by referring to His creatures. A true seeker doe not need to see Him with his own eyes, hear Him with his own ears, touch Him with his own hands, or encompass Him with his own heart. Were it not the case that His attributes proved Him, Exalted is His Praise, and His Names denoted Him, it was not possible for the taught knowledge of the creatures to perceive Him. Then the creatures would have worshipped His Names and Attributes instead of His meaning. Were it any different, the only worshipped one would have been other than Allah, the Exalted, since his Attributes and Names are other than Him. Did you understand?” `Imran said: “Yes, my Master, Please tell me more.” Al-Rida (AS) said: Beware of the saying of the ignorant ones, those whose hearts are blind, and who are in loss. They are those who claim that Allah, the Mighty and High and the All-Holy, is present in the hereafter for the Reckoning concerning rewards and punishments, but He is not present in this world for the acts of obedience and hope.’ If it were that Allah, the Mighty and High’s, presence was a source of His being defective in this world. He would not be present in the Hereafter either. However, these people have gone astray and have become blind and deaf towards the truth regarding what they do not know. That is the Word of the Mighty and High: But whosoever is blind in this (world), he shall also be blind in the Hereafter, and more erring from the way, i.e. blindness from existing realities. Intellectuals know that reasoning about what exists in the Hereafter is only possible through what exists in this world. Whoever tries to adopt knowledge of that world based upon his own personal views, and seek its existence, or tries to perceive it through his own soul and not through anything else would only get more distant from the facts about that world. That is because Allah, the Mighty and High, has given the knowledge of that world to a special group of people who think, know, and understand. `Imran asked, “O My Master, please inform me: Is innovation a created being or not?” Imam al-Rida (AS) answered, It is still creation which cannot be perceived through stillness. It is a created being since it has emerged. And it is Allah who made it emerged. Thus, it has become a creature. In other words, there only exist Allah, the Mighty and High, and His Creatures. There exists no third thing in between, and there is no third thing other than them. Whatever Allah, the Mighty and High, creates dos not disobey from being His Creature. What is crated is ether still, moving, different, harmonious, known, or ambiguous. Whatever is bounded is the creature of Allah, the Mighty and High. Moreover, know that all the things which the senses find for you are meanings perceived by the senses, and every sense demonstrates what Allah, the Mighty and High, has placed in its perception, and the heart understands all of that. Know that the One who is Ever-Standing without any ordination or bounds created creatures ordained by bounds and ordination. What He created were two creatures: the ordination and the ordained. Neither one had any color, taste or weight. He established one as the means of perceived the other and made them such that they could be perceived on their own. He did not create anything which could stand alone relying only on itself, so as to provide a means for arguing about and proving His Existence. Thus, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is Peerless and One. There is no second to support Him in order to enable Him to stand, or to assist Him or protect Him. However, the creatures support one another through the permission and will of Allah. People have differences of opinion over this subject to the extent that they have gone astray, become perplexed, and seek salvation from darkness by means of darkness through describing Allah using their own qualities. In this way, they have strayed far from the truth. Had they described Allah, the Mighty and High, using His Attributes, and described the creatures with the qualities of the creatures, they would have spoken through understanding and certitude and would not have come up with so many differences of opinion over Him. Since they sought what would perplex them, they entrapped themselves and became confused. Allah guides whomsoever He wills to the Straight Path. `Imran said: “O my Master! I bear witness that He is just as you have described. However, I still have one more question to ask.” The Imam (AS) said: “Ask whatever you wish to ask.” `Imran said: “I want to ask you what the All-Wise is contained in. Has anything encompassed Him? Does He change from one state to another? Is He in need of anything?” Al-Rida (AS) said: O `Imran! I will tell you, so understand. The one whom you question is the most ambiguous issue which the creatures face. As for those who are deficient in understanding, they do not recognize Him. As for those who are just and can reason, they are not incapable of understanding Him. First of all, if He had created the creatures due to need, then it would be proper to say that He changes His location to the location of what He creates because of His need for them. However, the Mighty and High, has not created anything out of need. He is always stable, neither in something, nor on something. However, it is the creatures which hold each other, enter into one another, and leave one another. Allah, the Mighty and High and the All-Holy, holds all of that by his Might. He does not enter anything and does not leave anything. Its preservation does not tire Him, nor is He incapable of holding it. None of the creatures know how that is, except for Allah, the Mighty and high, and His Messengers, the people who know His Secrets, those who run the affairs, and His Guardians who carry out His laws. In fact, His command is like the twinkling of an eye, or even closer that that. If He wills a thing, He only says to it `Be,’ and it is, according to His Will and Intent. Nothing that he has created is closer to Him than any other thing, nor is He father away from anything than another. O `Imran Have you understood? `Imran said: “Yes, my Master. I have understood. I bear witness that Allah is as you described Him to be and as you have described His Unity. I also bear witness that Muhammad is His Servant, who is appointed to guide and lead to the right religion.” He then faced the direction of Mecca, and fell into prostration. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said: When the other rhetoricians heard what `Imran the Sabian said, who was very hard to defeat in arguments and no one had ever defeated him before in arguments, not of them dared approach al-Rida (AS), and they asked him no more questions. It became nightfall. Then al-Ma`mun and al-Rida stood up, went inside and the people left. I was sitting alone with some of my friends when Muhammad ibn Ja`far called me in. I went to see him. He asked me, “O Nawfali! Did you see what your friend (the Imam) did?” Al-Nawfali replied, “No, by Allah! I did not think that `Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS) could plumb such depths. We did not know him in this way. He never spoke about theology in Medina, and theologians never gathered around him.” I further said: “The pilgrims used to come to him and ask him about the lawful and the unlawful and he answered them. Sometimes rhetoricians came to him and argued with him.” Muhammad ibn Ja`far said: “O Abu Muhammad, I fear that this man (al-Ma`mun) will envy him, poison him or inure him. So advise him to refrain from these things.” Al-Nawfali added, “He will not listen to me. This man (al-Ma`mun) only intended to test him to see whether he possesses the knowledge of his forefathers.” He said to me, “Tell him that his uncle does not like him to do such things, and wants him to stop them for different characteristics.” When we returned to Al-Rida’s house, I related to him the message from his uncle. Then the Imam smiled and said: “May Allah protect my uncle. I know him well. Why is he upset? Young man! Go to `Imran the Sabian, and bring him here.” I said: “May I be your ransom! I know where he is. He is with some of the Shi`ite brethren.” The Imam (AS) said: “Do not worry. Get a horse for him to ride on, and bring him here.” I went and brought `Imran. The Imam welcomed him, and asked for a robe of honor which he (AS) put on `Imran. The Imam also gave him a horse, and asked for ten thousand dinars which he (AS) donated to `Imran. `Imran said: “May I be your ransom! You have followed in the footsteps of your grandfather, the Commander of the Faithful (AS).” The Imam (AS) said: “We prefer this.” Then the Imam (AS) ordered dinner, had me sit on his right side, and had `Imran sit on his left side. After eating dinner, the Imam (AS) told `Imran, “Go now and come back in the morning. Then I will give you food from medina.” From then do many people came to `Imran to debate. He used to respond to their arguments and disprove them until they left. Al-Ma`mun granted him ten thousand dirhams. Al-Fadl also gave him some money. Then he appointed him as the director over the alms in (the city of) Balkh where he attained much good.",
    "arabicText": "1 - حدثنا أبو محمد جعفر بن علي بن أحمد الفقيه القمي ثم الإيلاقي رضي الله عنه، قال: أخبرنا أبو محمد الحسن بن محمد بن علي بن صدقة القمي، قال: حدثني أبو عمرو محمد بن عمر بن عبد العزيز الأنصاري الكجي، قال: حدثني من سمع الحسن بن محمد النوفلي ثم الهاشمي، يقول: لما قدم علي بن موسى الرضا عليهما السلام، إلى المأمون أمر الفضل بن سهل أن يجمع له أصحاب المقالات مثل الجاثليق و رأس الجالوت ورؤساء الصابئين والهربذ الأكبر وأصحاب زردهشت وقسطاس الرومي  والمتكلمين ليسمع كلامه وكلامهم، فجمعهم الفضل بن سهل، ثم أعلم المأمون باجتماعهم، فقال: أدخلهم علي، ففعل، فرحب بهم المأمون، ثم قال لهم: إني إنما جمعتكم لخير، وأحببت أن تناظروا ابن عمي هذا المدني القادم علي، فإذا كان بكره فاغدوا علي ولا يتخلف منكم أحد، فقالوا: السمع والطاعة يا أمير المؤمنين نحن مبكرون إن شاء الله. قال الحسن بن محمد النوفلي: فبينا نحن في حديث لنا عند أبي الحسن الرضا عليه السلام إذ دخل علينا ياسر الخادم وكان يتولى أمر أبي الحسن عليه السلام فقال: يا سيدي إن أمير المؤمنين يقرئك السلام فيقول: فداك أخوك إنه اجتمع إلي أصحاب المقالات وأهل الأديان والمتكلمون من جميع الملل فرأيك في البكور علينا إن أحببت كلامهم  وإن كرهت كلامهم فلا تتجشم  وإن أحببت أن نصير إليك خف ذلك علينا، فقال أبو الحسن عليه السلام: أبلغه السلام وقل له: قد علمت ما أردت، وأنا صائر إليك بكرة إن شاء الله. قال الحسن بن محمد النوفلي: فلما مضى ياسر التفت إلينا، ثم قال لي: يا نوفلي أنت عراقي ورقة العراقي غير غليظة  فما عندك في جمع ابن عمك علينا أهل الشرك وأصحاب المقالات؟ فقلت: جعلت فداك يريد الامتحان ويحب أن يعرف ما عندك، ولقد بنى على أساس غير وثيق البنيان وبئس والله ما بني، فقال لي: وما بناؤه في هذا الباب؟ قلت: إن أصحاب البدع والكلام خلاف العلماء، وذلك أن العالم لا ينكر غير المنكر، وأصحاب المقالات والمتكلمون وأهل الشرك أصحاب إنكار ومباهتة، وإن احتججت عليهم أن الله واحد قالوا: صحح وحدانيته، وإن قلت: إن محمدا صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم رسول الله قالوا: أثبت رسالته، ثم يباهتون الرجل وهو يبطل عليهم بحجته، ويغالطونه حتى يترك قوله، فاحذرهم جعلت فداك، قال: فتبسم عليه السلام ثم قال: يا نوفلي أتخاف أن يقطعوا علي حجتي؟  قلت: لا والله ما خفت عليك قط وإني لأرجو أن يظفرك الله بهم إن شاء الله، فقال لي: يا نوفلي أتحب أن تعلم متى يندم المأمون، قلت: نعم، قال: إذا سمع احتجاجي على أهل التوراة بتوراتهم وعلى أهل الإنجيل بإنجيلهم وعلى أهل الزبور بزبورهم وعلى الصابئين بعبرانيتهم وعلى الهرابذة بفارسيتهم وعلى أهل الروم بروميتهم وعلى أصحاب المقالات بلغاتهم، فإذا قطعت كل صنف ودحضت حجته وترك مقالته ورجع إلى قولي علم المأمون أن الموضع الذي هو بسبيله ليس هو بمستحق له، فعند ذلك تكون الندامة منه، ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله العلي العظيم. فلما أصبحنا أتانا الفضل بن سهل فقال له: جعلت فداك ابن عمك ينتظرك، وقد اجتمع القوم فما رأيك في إتيانه، فقال له الرضا عليه السلام: تقدمني فإني صائر إلى ناحيتكم إن شاء الله، ثم توضأ عليه السلام وضوء الصلاة وشرب شربة سويق وسقانا منه، ثم خرج وخرجنا معه حتى دخلنا على المأمون، فإذا المجلس غاص بأهله ومحمد بن جعفر في جماعة الطالبيين والهاشميين، والقواد حضور، فلما دخل الرضا عليه السلام قام المأمون وقام محمد بن جعفر وقام جميع بني هاشم، فما زالوا وقوفا والرضا عليه السلام جالس مع المأمون حتى أمرهم بالجلوس، فلم يزل المأمون مقبلا عليه يحدثه ساعة. ثم التفت إلى جاثليق، فقال: يا جاثليق هذا ابن عمي علي بن موسى - ابن جعفر وهو من ولد فاطمة بنت نبينا، وابن علي بن أبي طالب عليهم السلام فأحب أن تكلمه وتحاجه وتنصفه، فقال الجاثليق، يا أمير المؤمنين كيف أحاج رجلا يحتج علي بكتاب أنا منكره ونبي لا أو من به. فقال له الرضا عليه السلام: يا نصراني فإن احتججت عليك بإنجيلك أتقر به؟! قال الجاثليق: وهل أقدر على دفع ما نطق به الإنجيل؟ نعم والله أقر به على رغم أنفي، فقال له الرضا عليه السلام: سل عما بدا لك وافهم الجواب، قال الجاثليق: ما تقول في نبوة عيسى عليه السلام وكتابه هل تنكر منهما شيئا؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: أنا مقر بنبوة عيسى وكتابه وما بشر به أمته وأقر به الحواريون، وكافر بنبوة كل عيسى لم يقر بنبوة محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم و بكتابه ولم يبشر به أمته، قال الجاثليق: أليس إنما تقطع الأحكام بشاهدي عدل؟ قال: بلى، قال: فأقم شاهدين من غير أهل ملتك على نبوة محمد ممن لا تنكره النصرانية وسلنا مثل ذلك من غير أهل ملتنا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: الآن جئت بالنصفة يا نصراني، ألا تقبل مني العدل المقدم عند المسيح عيسى بن مريم، قال الجاثليق: ومن هذا العدل؟ سمه لي، قال: ما تقول في يوحنا الديلمي؟ قال: بخ بخ ذكرت أحب الناس إلى المسيح، قال: فأقسمت عليك هل نطق الإنجيل أن يوحنا قال: إن المسيح أخبرني بدين محمد العربي وبشرني به أنه يكون من بعده فبشرت به الحواريين فآمنوا به؟! قال الجاثليق: قد ذكر ذلك يوحنا عن المسيح وبشر بنبوة رجل وبأهل بيته ووصيه، ولم يلخص متى يكون ذلك ولم يسم لنا القوم فنعرفهم، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فأن جئناك بمن يقرء الإنجيل فتلا عليك ذكر محمد وأهل بيته وأمته أتؤمن به؟! قال: سديدا، قال الرضا عليه السلام لقسطاس الرومي: كيف حفظك للسفر الثالث من الإنجيل؟ قال: ما أحفظني له، ثم التفت إلى رأس الجالوت فقال له: ألست تقرء الإنجيل؟! قال: بلى لعمري قال: فخذ على السفر الثالث، فإن كان فيه ذكر محمد وأهل بيته وأمته سلام الله عليهم فاشهدوا لي وإن لم يكن فيه ذكره فلا تشهدوا لي، ثم قرأ عليه السلام السفر الثالث حتى إذا بلغ ذكر النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وقف، ثم قال: يا نصراني إني أسألك بحق المسيح وأمه أتعلم أني عالم بالإنجيل؟! قال: نعم، ثم تلا علينا ذكر محمد وأهل بيته وأمته، ثم قال: ما تقول يا نصراني هذا قول عيسى بن مريم؟! فإن كذبت ما ينطق به الإنجيل فقد كذبت عيسى و موسى عليهما السلام، ومتى أنكرت هذا الذكر وجب عليك القتل لأنك تكون قد كفرت بربك ونبيك وبكتابك، قال الجاثليق: لا أنكر ما قد بان لي في الإنجيل وإني لمقر به، قال الرضا عليه السلام: اشهدوا على إقراره. ثم قال: يا جاثليق سل عما بدا لك، قال الجاثليق: أخبرني عن حواري عيسى بن مريم كم كان عدتهم؟ وعن علماء الإنجيل كم كانوا؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: على الخبير سقطت، أما الحواريون فكانوا اثني عشر رجلا، وكان أفضلهم وأعلمهم ألوقا  وأما علماء النصارى فكانوا ثلاثة رجال: يوحنا الأكبر بأج، ويوحنا بقرقيسيا، ويوحنا الديلمي بزجان  وعنده كان ذكر النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وذكر أهل بيته وأمته وهو الذي بشر أمة عيسى وبني إسرائيل به. ثم قال عليه السلام: يا نصراني والله إنا لنؤمن بعيسى الذي آمن بمحمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وما ننقم على عيسا كم شيئا إلا ضعفه وقلة صيامه وصلاته، قال الجاثليق: أفسدت والله علمك وضعفت أمرك، وما كنت ظننت إلا أنك أعلم أهل الإسلام، قال الرضا عليه السلام: وكيف ذلك؟! قال الجاثليق: من قولك: إن عيسا كم كان ضعيفا قليل الصيام قليل الصلاة، وما أفطر عيسى يوما قط ولا نام بليل قط. وما زال صائم الدهر، قائم الليل، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فلمن كان يصوم ويصلي؟! قال: فخرس الجاثليق وانقطع. قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا نصراني إني أسألك عن مسألة، قال: سل فإن كل عندي علمها أجبتك، قال الرضا عليه السلام: ما أنكرت أن عيسى كان يحيى الموتى بإذن الله عز وجل، قال الجاثليق: أنكرت ذلك من قبل أن من أحيى الموتى وأبرأ الأكمه والأبرص فهو رب مستحق لأن يعبد  قال الرضا عليه السلام: فإن اليسع قد صنع مثل ما صنع عيسى  مشى على الماء وأحيى الموتى وأبرأ الأكمه والأبرص فلم يتخذه أمته ربا ولم يعبده أحد من دون الله عز وجل، ولقد صنع حزقيل النبي عليه السلام  مثل ما صنع عيسى بن مريم عليه السلام فأحيا خمسة وثلاثين ألف رجل من بعد موتهم بستين سنة، ثم التفت إلى رأس الجالوت فقال له: يا رأس الجالوت أتجد هؤلاء في شباب بني إسرائيل في التوراة؟! اختارهم بخت نصر من سبي بني إسرائيل حين غزا بيت المقدس ثم انصرف بهم إلى بابل فأرسله الله عز وجل إليهم فأحياهم  هذا في التوراة لا يدفعه إلا كافر منكم  قال رأس الجالوت: قد سمعنا به و عرفناه، قال: صدقت، ثم قال عليه السلام: يا يهودي خذ على هذا السفر من التوراة فتلا عليه السلام علينا من التوراة آيات، فأقبل اليهودي يترجح لقراءته ويتعجب  ثم أقبل على النصراني فقال: يا نصراني أفهؤلاء كانوا قبل عيسى أم عيسى كان قبلهم؟! قال: بل كانوا قبله، قال الرضا عليه السلام: لقد اجتمعت قريش إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فسألوه أن يحيي لهم موتاهم، فوجه معهم علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام فقال له: اذهب إلى الجبانة فناد بأسماء هؤلاء الرهط الذين يسألون عنهم بأعلى صوتك يا فلان و يا فلان ويا فلان يقول لكم محمد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: قوموا بإذن الله عز وجل، فقاموا ينفضون التراب عن رؤوسهم، فأقبلت قريش تسألهم عن أمورهم، ثم أخبروهم أن محمد قد بعث نبيا، وقالوا: وددنا أنا أدركناه فنؤمن به ولقد أبرأ الأكمه و الأبرص والمجانين وكلمه البهائم والطير والجن والشياطين ولم نتخذه ربا من دون الله عز وجل، ولم ننكر لأحد من هؤلاء فضلهم، فمتى اتخذتم عيسى ربا جاز لكم أن تتخذوا اليسع وحزقيل ربا لأنهما قد صنعا مثل ما صنع عيسى من إحياء الموتى، وغيره أن قوما من بني إسرائيل هربوا من بلادهم من الطاعون وهم ألوف حذر الموت فأماتهم الله في ساعة واحدة، فعمد أهل تلك القرية فحظروا عليهم حظيرة فلم يزالوا فيها حتى نخرت عظامهم وصاروا رميما، فمر بهم نبي من أنبياء بني إسرائيل فتعجب منهم ومن كثرة العظام البالية، فأوحى الله إليه أتحب أن أحييهم لك فتنذرهم؟ قال: نعم يا رب، فأوحى الله عز وجل إليه أن نادهم، فقال: أيتها العظام البالية قومي بإذن الله عز وجل فقاموا أحياء أجمعون ينفضون التراب عن رؤوسهم . ثم إبراهيم عليه السلام خليل الرحمن حين أخذ الطيور وقطعهن قطعا ثم وضع على كل جبل منهن جزءا ثم ناديهن فأقبلن سعيا إليه، ثم موسى بن عمران وأصحابه والسبعون الذين اختارهم صاروا معه إلى الجبل فقالوا له: إنك قد رأيت الله سبحانه فأرناه كما رأيته، فقال لهم: إني لم أره، فقالوا: لن نؤمن لك حتى نرى الله جهرة، فأخذتهم الصاعقة فاحترقوا عن آخرهم وبقي موسى وحيدا، فقال: يا رب اخترت سبعين رجلا من بني إسرائيل فجئت بهم وأرجع وحدي، فكيف يصدقني قومي بما أخبرهم به، فلو شئت أهلكتهم من قبل وإياي أفتهلكنا بما فعل السفهاء منا، فأحياهم الله عز وجل من بعد موتهم، وكل شئ ذكرته لك من هذا لا تقدر على دفعه لأن التوراة والإنجيل والزبور والفرقان قد نطقت به، فإن كان كل من أحيى الموتى وأبرأ الأكمه والأبرص والمجانين يتخذ ربا من دون الله فاتخذ هؤلاء كلهم أربابا، ما تقول يا نصراني؟! قال الجاثليق: القول قولك ولا إله إلا الله. ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى رأس الجالوت فقال: يا يهودي أقبل علي أسألك بالعشر الآيات التي أنزلت على موسى بن عمران عليه السلام هل تجد في التوراة مكتوبا نبأ محمد وأمته: إذا جاءت الأمة الأخيرة أتباع راكب البعير يسبحون الرب جدا جدا تسبيحا جديدا في الكنائس الجدد، فليفرغ بنوا إسرائيل إليهم وإلى ملكهم لتطمئن قلوبهم، فإن بأيديهم سيوفا ينتقمون بها من الأمم الكافرة في أقطار الأرض، هكذا هو في التوراة مكتوب؟! قال رأس الجالوت: نعم إنا لنجده كذلك، ثم قال: للجاثليق: يا نصراني كيف علمك بكتاب شعيا؟ قال: أعرفه حرفا حرفا، قال الرضا عليه السلام لهما: أتعرفان هذا من كلامه: (يا قوم إني رأيت صورة راكب الحمار لابسا جلابيب النور، ورأيت راكب البعير ضوؤه مثل ضوء القمر)؟ فقالا: قد قال ذلك شعيا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا نصراني هل تعرف في الإنجيل قول عيسى: إني ذاهب إلى ربي وربكم والفارقليطا جاء  هو الذي يشهد لي بالحق كما شهدت له، وهو الذي يفسر لكم كل شئ، وهو الذي يبدي فضائح الأمم، وهو الذي يكسر عمود الكفر؟ فقال الجاثليق: ما ذكرت شيئا مما في الإنجيل إلا ونحن مقرون به، فقال: أتجد هذا في الإنجيل ثابتا يا جاثليق؟! قال: نعم. قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا جاثليق ألا تخبرني عن الإنجيل الأول حين افتقدتموه عند من وجدتموه ومن وضع لكم هذا الإنجيل؟ قال له: ما افتقدنا الإنجيل إلا يوما واحدا حتى وجدنا غضا طريا فأخرجه إلينا يوحنا ومتى، فقال الرضا عليه السلام: ما أقل معرفتك بسر الإنجيل وعلمائه، فإن كان كما تزعم فلم اختلفتم في الإنجيل  إنما وقع الاختلاف في هذا الإنجيل الذي في أيديكم اليوم  فلو كان على العهد الأول لم تختلفوا فيه، ولكني مفيدك علم ذلك، اعلم أنه لما افتقد الإنجيل الأول اجتمعت النصارى إلى علمائهم فقالوا لهم: قتل عيسى بن مريم عليه السلام وافتقدنا الإنجيل وأنتم العلماء فما عندكم؟ فقال لهم ألوقا ومر قابوس: إن الإنجيل في صدورنا، ونحن نخرجه إليكم سفرا سفرا في كل أحد، فلا تحزنوا عليه ولا تخلوا الكنائس، فإنا سنتلوه عليكم في كل أحد سفرا سفرا حتى نجمعه لكم كله، فقعد ألوقا ومر قابوس  ويوحنا ومتى ووضعوا لهم هذا الإنجيل بعد ما افتقدتم الإنجيل الأول، وإنما كان هؤلاء الأربعة تلاميذ التلاميذ الأولين، أعلمت ذلك؟ قال الجاثليق: أما هذا فلم أعلمه وقد علمته الآن، وقد بان لي من فضل علمك بالإنجيل  وسمعت أشياء مما علمته شهد قلبي أنها حق فاستزدت كثيرا من الفهم. فقال له الرضا عليه السلام: فكيف شهادة هؤلاء عندك؟ قال: جائزة، هؤلاء علماء الإنجيل وكل ما شهدوا به فهو حق، فقال الرضا عليه السلام للمأمون ومن حضره من أهل بيته ومن غيرهم: اشهدوا عليه، قالوا: قد شهدنا، ثم قال للجاثليق: بحق الابن وأمه هل تعلم أن متى قال: (إن المسيح هو ابن داود بن إبراهيم بن إسحاق بن يعقوب بن يهودا بن حضرون )، وقال مرقابوس في نسبة عيسى بن - مريم: (إنه كلمة الله أحلها في جسد الآدمي فصارت إنسانا)، وقال ألوقا: (إن عيسى ابن مريم وأمه كانا إنسانين من لحم ودم فدخل فيهما روح القدس)؟  ثم إنك تقول من شهادة عيسى على نفسه: حقا أقول لكم يا معشر الحواريين: إنه لا يصعد إلى السماء إلا ما نزل منها  إلا راكب البعير خاتم الأنبياء فإنه يصعد إلى السماء وينزل، فما تقول في هذا القول؟ قال الجاثليق: هذا قول عيسى لا ننكره قال الرضا عليهما السلام،: فما تقول في شهادة ألوقا ومر قابوس ومتى على عيسى وما نسبوه إليه؟  قال الجاثليق: كذبوا على عيسى، قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا قوم أليس قد زكاهم وشهد أنهم علماء الإنجيل وقولهم حق؟! فقال الجاثليق: يا عالم المسلمين  أحب أن تعفيني من أمر هؤلاء، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فإنا قد فعلنا، سل يا نصراني عما بدا لك، قال الجاثليق: ليسألك غيري، فلا وحق المسيح ما ظننت أن في علماء المسلمين مثلك. فالتفت الرضا عليه السلام إلى رأس الجالوت فقال له: تسألني أو أسألك؟ قال: بل أسألك، ولست أقبل منك حجة إلا من التوراة أو من الإنجيل أو من زبور داود أو مما في صحف إبراهيم وموسى  فقال الرضا عليه السلام:: تقبل مني حجة إلا بما تنطق به التوراة على لسان موسى بن عمران والإنجيل على لسان عيسى بن مريم و الزبور على لسان داود، فقال رأس الجالوت: من أين تثبت نبوة محمد؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: شهد بنبوته صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم موسى بن عمران وعيسى بن مريم وداود خليفة الله عز وجل في الأرض، فقال له: أثبت قول موسى بن عمران، قال الرضا عليه السلام: هل تعلم يا يهودي أن موسى أوصى بني إسرائيل فقال لهم: إنه سيأتيكم نبي هو من إخوتكم فبه فصدقوا، ومنه فاسمعوا، فهل تعلم أن لبني إسرائيل إخوة غير ولد إسماعيل إن كنت تعرف قرابه إسرائيل من إسماعيل والنسب الذي بينهما من قبل إبراهيم عليه السلام؟ فقال رأس الجالوت: هذا قول موسى لا ندفعه، فقال له الرضا عليه السلام: هل جاءكم من إخوة بني إسرائيل نبي غير محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم؟! قال: لا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: أوليس قد صح هذا عندكم؟! قال: نعم، ولكني أحب أن تصححه لي من التوراة، فقال له الرضا عليه السلام: هل تنكر أن التوراة تقول لكم: جاء النور من جبل طور سيناء، وأضاء لنا من جبل ساعير  واستعلن علينا من جبل فاران؟ قال رأس الجالوت: أعرف هذه الكلمات وما أعرف تفسيرها، قال الرضا عليه السلام: أنا أخبرك به، أما قوله: جاء النور من جبل طور سيناء فذلك وحي الله تبارك وتعالى الذي أنزله على موسى عليه السلام على جبل طور سيناء، وأما قوله: وأضاء لنا من جبل ساعير فهو الجبل الذي أوحى الله عز وجل إلى عيسى بن مريم عليه السلام وهو عليه، و أما قوله: واستعلن علينا من جبل فاران فذلك جبل من جبال مكة بينه وبينها يوم، وقال شعيا النبي عليه السلام فيما تقول أنت وأصحابك في التوراة : رأيت راكبين أضاء لهما الأرض، أحدهما راكب على حمار والآخر على جمل، فمن راكب الحمار ومن راكب الجمل؟! قال رأس الجالوت: لا أعرفهما فخبرني بهما، قال عليه السلام: أما راكب الحمار فعيسى بن مريم، وأما راكب الجمل فمحمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم، أتنكر هذا من التوراة؟! قال: لا ما أنكره، ثم قال الرضا عليه السلام: هل تعرف حيقوق النبي  قال: نعم إني به لعارف، قال عليه السلام: فإنه قال وكتابكم ينطق به: جاء الله بالبيان من جبل فاران، وامتلئت السماوات من تسبيح أحمد وأمته، يحمل خيله في البحر كما يحمل في البر، يأتينا بكتاب جديد بعد خراب بيت المقدس - يعني بالكتاب القرآن - أتعرف هذا وتؤمن به؟ قال رأس الجالوت: قد قال ذلك حيقوق عليه السلام ولا ننكر قوله، قال الرضا عليه السلام: وقد قال داود في زبوره وأنت تقرء: اللهم ابعث مقيم السنة بعد الفترة، فهل تعرف نبيا أقام السنة بعد الفترة غير محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم؟! قال رأس الجالوت: هذا قول داود نعرفه ولا ننكره، ولكن عني بذلك عيسى، و أيامه هي الفترة، قال الرضا عليه السلام: جهلت، إن عيسى لم يخالف السنة وقد كان موافقا لسنة التوراة حتى رفعه الله إليه، وفي الإنجيل مكتوب: إن ابن البرة ذاهب والفارقليطا جاء من بعده  وهو الذي يخفف الآصار، ويفسر لكم كل شئ، ويشهد لي كما شهدت له، أنا جئتكم بالأمثال، وهو يأتيكم بالتأويل، (هامش صفحة 428)  فيما اليوم بأيدي الناس أشعيا بألف في أوله، وقد مر احتمالان في التوراة في قصة حزقيل.  فيما اليوم بأيدي الناس (حبقوق) بالباء الموحدة بعد الحاء.  في البحار والعيون وفي نسخة (ه) (البارقلطا) بالباء الموحدة مكان الفاء. أتؤمن بهذا في الإنجيل؟! قال نعم لا أنكره. فقال له الرضا عليه السلام: يا رأس الجالوت أسألك عن نبيك موسى بن عمران، فقال: سل، قال: ما الحجة على أن موسى ثبتت نبوته؟ قال اليهودي أنه جاء بما لم يجئ به أحد من الأنبياء قبله، قال له: مثل ماذا؟ قال مثل فلق البحر، وقلبه العصا حية تسعى، وضربة الحجر فانفجرت منه العيون، وإخراجه يده بيضاء للناظرين وعلامات لا يقدر الخلق على مثلها، قال له الرضا عليه السلام: صدقت، إذا كانت حجته على نبوته أنه جاء بما لا يقدر الخلق على مثله أفليس كل من ادعى أنه نبي ثم جاء بما لا يقدر الخلق على مثله وجب عليكم تصديقه؟ قال لا لأن موسى لم يكن له نظير لمكانه من ربه وقربه منه، ولا يجب علينا الاقرار بنبوة من ادعاها حتى يأتي من الأعلام بمثل ما جاء به، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فكيف أقررتم بالأنبياء الذين كانوا قبل موسى عليه السلام ولم يفلقوا البحر ولم يفجروا من الحجر اثنتي عشر عينا ولم يخرجوا أيديهم بيضاء مثل إخراج موسى يده بيضاء ولم يقلبوا العصا حية تسعى؟! قال له اليهودي: قد خبرتك أنه متى جاؤوا على دعوى نبوتهم من الآيات بما لا يقدر الخلق على مثله ولو جاؤوا بما لم يجئ به موسى أو كان على غير ما جاء به موسى وجب تصديقهم  قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا رأس الجالوت فما يمنعك من الاقرار بعيسى بن مريم وقد كان يحيي الموتى ويبرئ الأكمه والأبرص و يخلق من الطين كهيئة الطير ثم ينفخ فيه فيكون طيرا بإذن الله؟ قال رأس الجالوت: يقال: إنه فعل ذلك ولم نشهده، قال له الرضا عليه السلام: أرأيت ما جاء به موسى من الآيات شاهدته؟! أليس أنما جاء في الأخبار به من ثقات أصحاب موسى أنه فعل ذلك؟! قال: بلى، قال: فكذلك أتتكم الأخبار المتواترة بما فعل عيسى بن مريم فكيف صدقتم بموسى ولم تصدقوا بعيسى؟! فلم يحر جوابا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: و كذلك أمر محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وما جاء به وأمر كل نبي بعثة الله، ومن آياته أنه كان يتيما فقيرا راعيا أجيرا لم يتعلم كتابا ولم يختلف إلى معلم، ثم جاء بالقرآن الذي فيه (هامش صفحة 429)  قوله: (وجب تصديقهم) جواب لمتى جاؤوا، و (لوا) وصلية بين الشرط والجزاء. قصص الأنبياء وأخبارهم حرفا حرفا وأخبار من مضى ومن بقي إلى يوم القيامة، ثم كان يخبرهم بأسرارهم وما يعملون في بيوتهم، وجاء بآيات كثيرة لا تحصى، قال رأس الجالوت: لم يصح عندنا خبر عيسى ولا خبر محمد، ولا يجوز لنا أن نقر لهما بما لم يصح، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فالشاهد الذي شهد لعيسى ولمحمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم شاهد زور؟!  فلم يحر جوابا. ثم دعا عليه السلام بالهربذ الأكبر فقال له الرضا عليه السلام: أخبرني عن زردهشت الذي تزعم أنه نبي ما حجتك على نبوته: قال: إنه أتى بما لم يأتنا به أحد قبله ولم نشهده ولكن الأخبار من أسلافنا وردت علينا بأنه أحل لنا ما لم يحله غيره فاتبعناه، قال عليه السلام: أفليس إنما أتتكم الأخبار فاتبعتموه؟! قال: بلى، قال: فكذلك سائر الأمم السالفة أتتهم الأخبار بما أتى به النبيون وأتى به موسى وعيسى ومحمد صلوات الله عليهم فما عذركم في ترك الاقرار لهم إذا كنتم إنما أقررتم بزردهشت من قبل الأخبار المتواترة بأنه جاء بما لم يجئ به غيره؟! فانقطع الهربذ مكانه. فقال الرضا عليه السلام: يا قوم إن كان فيكم أحد يخالف الإسلام وأراد أن يسأل فليسأل غير محتشم، فقام إليه عمران الصابئ وكان واحدا في المتكلمين فقال: يا عالم الناس لولا أنك دعوت إلى مسألتك لم أقدم عليك بالمسائل، ولقد دخلت الكوفة والبصرة والشأم والجزيرة ولقيت المتكلمين فلم أقع على أحد يثبت لي واحدا ليس غيره قائما بوحدانيته، أفتأذن لي أن أسألك؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: إن كان في الجماعة عمران الصابئ فأنت هو، فقال: أنا هو، فقال عليه السلام: سل يا عمران وعليك بالنصفة، وإياك والخطل والجور، قال: والله يا سيدي ما أريد إلا أن تثبت لي شيئا أتعلق به فلا أجوزه، قال عليه السلام: سل عما بدا لك، فازدحم عليه الناس و انضم بعضهم إلى بعض، فقال عمران الصابئ: أخبرني عن الكائن الأول وعما خلق، قال عليه السلام: سألت فافهم، أما الواحد فلم يزل واحدا كائنا لا شئ معه بلا حدود ولا أعراض ولا يزال كذلك، ثم خلق خلقا مبتدعا مختلفا بأعراض وحدود (هامش صفحة 430)  المراد بالشاهد شعيا وحيقوق وداود الذين مرت شهادتهم. مختلفة لا في شئ أقامه ولا في شئ حده ولا على شئ حذاه ولا مثله له  فجعل من بعد ذلك الخلق صفوة وغير صفوة واختلافا وائتلافا وألوانا وذوقا وطعما لا لحاجة كانت منه إلى ذلك ولا لفضل منزلة لم يبلغها إلا به، ولا رأى لنفسه فيما خلق زيادة ولا نقصانا، تعقل هذا يا عمران؟ قال: نعم والله يا سيدي، قال عليه السلام: واعلم يا عمران أنه لو كان خلق ما خلق لحاجة لم يخلق إلا من يستعين به على حاجته ولكان ينبغي أن يخلق أضعاف ما خلق لأن الأعوان كلما كثروا كان صاحبهم أقوى، والحاجة يا عمران لا يسعها لأنه لم يحدث من الخلق شيئا إلا حدثت فيه حاجة أخرى  ولذلك أقول: لم يخلق الخلق لحاجة، ولكن نقل بالخلق الحوائج بعضهم إلى بعض وفضل بعضهم على بعض بلا حاجة منه إلى من فضل ولا نقمة منه على من أذل،، فلهذا خلق . قال عمران: يا سيدي هل كان الكائن معلوما في نفسه عند نفسه؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: إنما تكون المعلمة بالشئ لنفي خلافه وليكون الشئ نفسه بما نفى عنه موجودا، ولم يكن هناك شئ يخالفه فتدعوه الحاجة إلى نفي ذلك الشئ عن نفسه بتحديد علم منها  أفهمت يا عمران؟ قال: نعم والله يا سيدي، فأخبرني بأي شئ علم ما علم أبضمير أم بغير ذلك؟  قال الرضا عليه السلام: أرأيت إذا علم بضمير هل تجد بدا من أن تجعل لذلك الضمير حدا ينتهي إليه المعرفة؟! قال عمران: لا بد من ذلك ، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فما ذلك الضمير؟ فانقطع ولم يحر جوابا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: لا بأس، وإن سألتك عن الضمير نفسه تعرفه بضمير آخر؟! فقال الرضا عليه السلام: أفسدت عليك قولك ودعواك يا عمران، أليس ينبغي أن تعلم أن الواحد ليس يوصف بضمير، وليس يقال له أكثر من فعل وعمل وصنع وليس يتوهم منه مذاهب وتجزئة كمذاهب المخلوقين وتجزئتهم  فاعقل ذلك وابن عليه ما علمت صوابا. قال عمران: يا سيدي ألا تخبرني عن حدود خلقه كيف هي وما معانيها و على كم نوع يتكون، قال عليه السلام: قد سألت فافهم، إن حدود خلقه على ستة أنواع  ملموس وموزون ومنظور إليه. وما لا وزن له  وهو الروح، ومنها منظور إليه و ليس له وزن ولا لمس ولا حس ولا لون ولا ذوق. والتقدير، والأعراض، والصور، والعرض، والطول. ومنها العمل والحركات التي تصنع الأشياء وتعلمها  وتغيرها من حال إلى حال وتزيدها وتنقصها، وأما الأعمال والحركات فإنها تنطلق لأنها لا وقت لها أكثر من قدر ما يحتاج إليه، فإذا فرغ من الشئ انطلق بالحركة وبقي الأثر، ويجري مجرى الكلام الذي يذهب ويبقى أثره. قال له عمران: يا سيدي ألا تخبرني عن الخالق إذا كان واحدا لا شئ غيره ولا شئ معه أليس قد تغير بخلقه الخلق؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: لم يتغير عز وجل بخلق الخلق، ولكن الخلق يتغير بتغييره. قال عمران: فبأي شئ عرفناه؟ قال عليه السلام: بغيره، قال: فأي شئ غيره؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: مشيته واسمه وصنفه وما أشبه ذلك، وكل ذلك محدث مخلوق مدبر. قال عمران: يا سيدي فأي شئ هو؟ قال عليه السلام: هو نور، بمعنى أنه هاد لخلقه من أهل السماء وأهل الأرض، وليس لك علي أكثر من توحيدي إياه قال عمران: يا سيدي أليس قد كان ساكتا قبل الخلق لا ينطق ثم نطق؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: لا يكون السكوت إلا عن نطق قبله  والمثل في ذلك أنه لا يقال للسراج: هو ساكت لا ينطق، ولا يقال: إن السراح ليضيئ فيما يريد أن يفعل بنا لأن الضوء من السراج ليس بفعل منه ولا كون، وإنما هو ليس شئ غيره، فلما استضاء لنا قلنا: قد أضاء لنا حتى استضأنا به، فبهذا تستبصر أمرك . قال عمران: يا سيدي فإن الذي كان عندي أن الكائن قد تغير في فعله عن حاله بخلقه الخلق، قال الرضا عليه السلام: أحلت يا عمران في قولك: إن الكائن يتغير في وجه من الوجوه حتى يصيب الذات منه ما يغيره، يا عمران هل تجد النار يغيرها تغير نفسها، أو هل تجد الحرارة تحرق نفسها، أو هل رأيت بصيرا قط رأى بصره؟  قال عمران: لم أر هذا. ألا تخبرني يا سيدي أهو في الخلق أم الخلق فيه؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: جل يا عمران عن ذلك، ليس هو في الخلق ولا الخلق فيه، تعالى عن ذلك، وسأعلمك ما تعرفه به ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله، أخبرني عن المرأة أنت فيها أم هي فيك؟! (هامش صفحة 434)  لأنه عدم الملكة ولا يصح إلا فيما تصح ملكته، فليس الله ساكتا ولا ناطقا بالمعنى الذي فينا حتى يلزم فيه التغير والتركيب، كما لا يقال للسراج: أنه ساكت حين طفئه ولا أنه ناطق حين أضاءته، وقوله: (ولا يقال إن السراج ليضيئ فيما يريد - الخ) كأنه تمثيل وبيان لقوله: (هو نور) حتى لا يتوهم السامع من تفسيره بالهادي أن النور كون وإحداث وراء ذاته تعالى، بل هو هو وليس شئ غيره على ما صرح به في أحاديث الباب العاشر و ما بعده، كما أن الضوء عين السراج لا أنه كون وإحداث وراء ذاته، وللمجلسي - رحمه الله - في تفسير هذا الكلام غير ذلك.  في نسخة (د) (يستقر أمرك).  المراد بهذه الأمثلة بيان أن الشئ لا يتغير من قبل نفسه ولا من قبل فعله، بل إنما يتغير بتأثير غيره، فإذا امتنع تأثير الغير فيه امتنع تغيره. فإن كان ليس واحد منكما في صاحبه فبأي شئ استدللت بها على نفسك؟! قال عمران: بضوء بيني وبينها، فقال الرضا عليه السلام: هل ترى من ذلك الضوء في المرآة أكثر مما تراه في عينك؟ قال: نعم، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فأرناه، فلم يحر جوابا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فلا أرى النور إلا وقد دلك ودل المرآة على أنفسكما من غير أن يكون في واحد منكما، ولهذا أمثال كثيرة غير هذا لا يجد الجاهل فيها مقالا، ولله المثل الأعلى. ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى المأمون فقال: الصلاة قد حضرت، فقال عمران: يا سيدي لا تقطع علي مسألتي فقد رق قلبي، قال الرضا عليه السلام: نصلي ونعود، فنهض ونهض المأمون: فصلى الرضا عليه السلام داخلا، وصلى الناس خارجا خلف محمد ابن جعفر، ثم خرجا، فعاد الرضا عليه السلام إلى مجلسه ودعا بعمران فقال: سل يا عمران، قال: يا سيدي ألا تخبرني عن الله عز وجل هل يوحد بحقيقة أو يوحد بوصف؟  قال الرضا عليه السلام: إن الله المبدئ الواحد الكائن الأول لم يزل واحدا لا شئ معه، فردا لا ثاني معه، لا معلوما ولا مجهولا ولا محكما ولا متشابها ولا مذكورا ولا منسيا، ولا شيئا يقع عليه اسم شئ من الأشياء غيره، ولا من وقت كان ولا إلى وقت يكون، ولا بشئ قام، ولا إلى شئ يقوم، ولا إلى شئ استند، ولا في شئ استكن وذلك كله قبل الخلق إذ لا شئ غيره  وما أوقعت عليه من الكل فهي صفات محدثة وترجمة يفهم بها من فهم . واعلم أن الابداع والمشية والإرادة معناها واحد وأسماؤها ثلاثة، وكان أول إبداعه وإرادته ومشيته الحروف التي جعلها أصلا لكل شئ ودليلا على كل مدرك وفاصلا لكل مشكل، وتلك الحروف تفريق كل شئ  من اسم حق وباطل أو فعل أو مفعول أو معنى أو غير معنى، وعليها اجتمعت الأمور كلها، ولم يجعل للحروف في إبداعه لها معنى غير أنفسها يتناهى ولا جود  لأنها مبدعة بالإبداع، و النور في هذا الموضع أول فعل الله الذي هو نور السماوات والأرض، والحروف هي المفعول بذلك الفعل، وهي الحروف التي عليها الكلام والعبارات كلها من الله عز وجل، علمها خلقه، وهي ثلاثة وثلاثون حرفا، فمنها ثمانية وعشرون حرفا تدل على اللغات العربية، ومن الثمانية والعشرين اثنان وعشرون حرفا  تدل على اللغات السريانية والعبرانية. ومنها خمسة أحرف متحرفة في سائر اللغات من العجم لأقاليم اللغات كلها، وهي خمسة أحرف تحرفت من الثمانية والعشرين الحرف من اللغات  فصارت الحروف ثلاثة وثلاثين حرفا، فأما الخمسة المختلفة فبحجج  لا يجوز ذكرها أكثر مما ذكرناه، ثم جعل الحروف بعد إحصائها  وإحكام عدتها فعلا منه كقوله عز وجل: (كن فيكون) وكن منه صنع، وما يكون به المصنوع، فالخلق الأول من الله عز وجل الابداع لا وزن له ولا حركة ولا سمع ولا لون ولا حس، والخلق الثاني الحروف لا وزن لها ولا لون، وهي مسموعة موصوفة غير منظور إليها، والخلق الثالث ما كان من الأنواع كلها محسوسا ملموسا ذا ذوق منظورا إليه، والله تبارك وتعالى سابق للإبداع لأنه ليس قبله عز وجل شئ ولا كان معه شئ، والإبداع سابق للحروف، والحروف لا تدل على غير أنفسها قال المأمون: وكيف لا تدل على غير أنفسها؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: لأن الله تبارك و تعالى لا يجمع منها شيئا لغير معنى أبدا، فإذا ألف منها أحرفا أربعة أو خمسه أو ستة أو أكثر من ذلك أو أقل لم يؤلفها لغير معنى ولم يك إلا لمعنى محدث لم يكن قبل ذلك شيئا. قال عمران: فكيف لنا بمعرفة ذلك؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: أما المعرفة فوجه ذلك وبابه أنك تذكر الحروف  إذا لم ترد بها غير أنفسها ذكرتها فردا فقلت: ا ب ت ث ج ح خ حتى تأتي على آخرها فلم تجد لها معنى غير أنفسها، فإذا ألفتها وجمعت منها أحرفا وجعلتها اسما وصفة لمعنى ما طلبت ووجه ما عنيت كانت دليلة على معانيها داعية إلى الموصوف بها، أفهمته؟ قال: نعم. قال الرضا عليه السلام: واعلم أنه لا يكون صفة لغير موصوف ولا اسم لغير معنى ولا حد لغير محدود، والصفات والأسماء كلها تدل على الكمال والوجود، ولا تدل على الإحاطة كما تدل على الحدود التي هي التربيع والتثليث والتسديس لأن الله عز وجل وتقدس تدرك معرفته بالصفات والأسماء، ولا تدرك بالتحديد بالطول و العرض والقلة والكثرة واللون والوزن وما أشبه ذلك، وليس يحل بالله جل و تقدس شئ من ذلك حتى يعرفه خلقه بمعرفتهم أنفسهم بالضرورة التي ذكرنا  ولكن يدل على الله عز وجل بصفاته ويدرك بأسمائه ويستدل عليه بخلقه حتى لا يحتاج في ذلك الطالب المرتاد إلى رؤية عين ولا استماع أذن ولا لمس كف ولا إحاطة بقلب، فلو كانت صفاته جل ثناؤه لا تدل عليه وأسماؤه لا تدعو إليه والمعلمة من الخلق لا تدركه لمعناه  كانت العبادة من الخلق لأسمائه وصفاته دون معناه، فلولا أن ذلك كذلك لكان المعبود الموحد غير الله تعالى لأن صفاته وأسماءه غيره، أفهمت؟ قال: نعم يا سيدي زدني. قال الرضا عليه السلام: إياك وقول الجهال أهل العمى والضلال الذين يزعمون أن الله عز وجل وتقدس موجود في الآخرة للحساب والثواب والعقاب، وليس بموجود في الدنيا للطاعة والرجاء، ولو كان في الوجود لله عز وجل نقص و اهتضام لم يوجد في الآخرة أبدا، ولكن القوم تاهوا وعموا وصموا عن الحق من حيث لا يعلمون، وذلك قوله عز وجل: ﴿ومن كان في هذه أعمى فهو في الآخرة أعمى وأضل سبيلا﴾  يعني أعمى عن الحقائق الموجودة، وقد علم ذووا الألباب أن الاستدلال على ما هناك لا يكون إلا بما ههنا، ومن أخذ علم ذلك برأيه وطلب وجوده وإدراكه عن نفسه دون غيرها لم يزدد من علم ذلك إلا بعدا لأن الله عز وجل جعل علم ذلك خاصة عند قوم يعقلون ويعلمون ويفهمون. قال عمران: يا سيدي ألا تخبرني عن الابداع خلق هو أم غير خلق؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: بل خلق ساكن لا يدرك بالسكون وإنما صار خلقا لأنه شئ محدث، والله الذي أحدثه فصار خلقا له، وإنما هو الله عز وجل وخلقه لا ثالث بينهما ولا ثالث غيرهما، فما خلق الله عز وجل لم يعد أن يكون خلقه، وقد يكون الخلق ساكنا ومتحركا ومختلفا ومؤتلفا ومعلوما ومتشابها، وكل ما وقع عليه حد فهو خلق الله عز وجل. واعلم أن كل ما أوجدتك الحواس فهو معنى مدرك للحواس  وكل حاسة تدل على ما جعل الله عز وجل لها في إدراكها، والفهم من القلب بجميع ذلك كله . واعلم أن الواحد الذي هو قائم بغير تقدير ولا تحديد خلق خلقا مقدرا بتحديد وتقدير، وكان الذي خلق خلقين اثنين التقدير والمقدر، فليس في كل واحد منهما لون ولا ذوق ولا وزن  فجعل أحدهما يدرك بالآخر، وجعلهما مدركين بأنفسهما، ولم يخلق شيئا فردا قائما بنفسه دون غيره للذي أراد من الدلالة على نفسه وإثبات وجوده  والله تبارك وتعالى  فرد واحد لا ثاني معه يقيمه ولا يعضده ولا يمسكه  والخلق يمسك بعضه بعضا بإذن الله ومشيته، وإنما اختلف الناس في هذا الباب حتى تاهوا وتحيروا وطلبوا الخلاص من الظلمة بالظلمة في وصفهم الله بصفة أنفسهم فازدادوا من الحق بعدا، ولو وصفوا الله عز وجل بصفاته ووصفوا المخلوقين بصفاتهم لقالوا بالفهم واليقين ولما اختلفوا، فلما طلبوا من ذلك ما تحيروا فيه ارتبكوا  والله يهدي من يشاء إلى صراط مستقيم. قال عمران: يا سيدي أشهد أنه كما وصفت، ولكن بقيت لي مسألة، قال: سل عما أردت، قال: أسألك عن الحكيم في أي شئ هو، وهل يحيط به شئ، وهل يتحول من شئ إلى شئ، أوبه حاجة إلى شئ؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: أخبرك يا عمران فاعقل ما سألت عنه فإنه من أغمض ما يرد على المخلوقين في مسائلهم، وليس يفهمه المتفاوت عقله، العازب علمه  ولا يعجز عن فهمه أولوا العقل المنصفون، أما أول ذلك فلو كان خلق ما خلق لحاجة منه لجاز لقائل أن يقول: يتحول إلى ما خلق لحاجته إلى ذلك ولكنه عز وجل لم يخلق شيئا لحاجته  ولم يزل ثابتا لا في شئ ولا على شئ إلا أن الخلق يمسك بعضه بعضا ويدخل بعضه في بعض ويخرج منه، والله عز وجل وتقدس بقدرته يمسك ذلك كله يدخل في شئ ولا يخرج منه ولا يؤوده حفظه ولا يعجز عن إمساكه، ولا يعرف أحد من الخلق كيف ذلك إلا الله عز وجل ومن أطلعه عليه من رسله وأهل سره والمستحفظين لأمره وخزانه القائمين بشريعته، وإنما أمره كلمح البصر أو هو أقرب  إذا شاء شيئا فإنما يقول له: كن، فيكون بمشيته وإرادته، وليس شئ من خلقه أقرب إليه من شئ، ولا شئ منه هو أبعد منه من شئ  أفهمت يا عمران؟ قال: نعم يا سيدي قد فهمت وأشهد أن الله على ما وصفته ووحدته، وأن محمدا عبده المبعوث بالهدى ودين الحق، ثم خر ساجدا نحوا القبلة وأسلم. قال الحسن بن محمد النوفلي: فلما نظر المتكلمون إلى كلام عمران الصابئ وكان جدلا لم يقطعه عن حجته أحد قط لم يدن من الرضا عليه السلام أحد منهم ولم يسألوه عن شئ، وأمسينا فنهض المأمون والرضا عليه السلام فدخلا وانصرف الناس، و كنت مع جماعة من أصحابنا إذ بعث إلي محمد بن جعفر فأتيته، فقال لي: يا نوفلي أما رأيت ما جاء به صديقك، لا والله ما ظننت أن علي بن موسى خاض في شئ من هذا قط، ولا عرفناه به أنه كان يتكلم بالمدينة أو يجتمع إلى أصحاب الكلام، قلت، قد كان الحاج يأتونه فيسألونه عن أشياء من حلالهم وحرامهم فيجيبهم، و كلمه من يأتيه لحاجة  فقال محمد بن جعفر: يا أبا محمد إني أخاف عليه أن يحسده هذا الرجل فيسمه أو يفعل به بلية، فشر عليه بالإمساك عن هذه الأشياء، قلت: إذا لا يقبل مني  وما أراد الرجل إلا امتحانه ليعلم هل عنده شئ من علوم آبائه عليهم السلام فقال لي: قل له: إن عمك قد كره هذا الباب وأحب أن تمسك عن هذه الأشياء لخصال شتى، فلما انقلبت إلى منزل الرضا عليه السلام أخبرته بما كان من عمه محمد بن جعفر فتبسم، ثم قال: حفظ الله عمي ما أعرفني به لم كره ذلك، يا غلام صر إلى عمران الصابئ فأتني به. فقلت: جعلت فداك أنا أعرف موضعه هو عند بعض إخواننا من الشيعة، قال عليه السلام: فلا بأس قربوا إليه دابة، فصرت إلى عمران فأتيته به فرحب به ودعا بكسوة فخلعها عليه وحمله  ودعا بعشرة آلاف درهم فوصله بها، فقلت: جعلت فداك حكيت فعل جدك أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام، فقال: هكذا نحب  ثم دعا عليه السلام بالعشاء فأجلسني عن يمينه وأجلس عمران عن يساره حتى إذا فرغنا قال لعمران: انصرف مصاحبا وبكر علينا نطعمك طعام المدينة، فكان عمران بعد ذلك يجتمع عليه المتكلمون من أصحاب المقالات فيبطل أمرهم حتى اجتنبوه، ووصله المأمون بعشرة آلاف درهم، وأعطاه الفضل مالا وحمله، و ولاه الرضا عليه السلام صدقات بلخ فأصاب الرغائب.  باب ذكر مجلس الرضا عليه السلام مع سليمان المروزي متكلم خراسان عند المأمون في التوحيد ",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "1. Abu Muhammad Ja`far ibn `Ali ibn Ahmad the jurist resident of Qum then of al-Iylaq (RA‬‬ ‫‪said: Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Ali ibn Sadaqah al-Qummi reported to us‬‬ ‫‪that Abu `Amr Muhammad ibn `Umar ibn `Abd `Aziz al-Ansari al-Kajji related to me that one‬‬ ‫‪who heard from al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali al-Hashimi related to me that‬‬ ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "When `Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS) came to see al-Ma`mun, al-Ma`mun ordered al-Fadl ibn Sahl to summon the prominent theologians from among the rhetoricians such as the Catholicos [al-jathaliq]. The Head of the Rabbis [ra`s al-jalut], the heads of the Sabians, the High Priest [al-hirbidh] of Zoroaster and his followers, Castile Nestus, the Roman medical scientist, and the rest of the theologians in order to hear their words and those of al-Rida (AS). Al-Fadl ibn Sahl gathered them together, then informed al-Ma`mun about their meeting. Al-Ma`mun said: `Let them enter my presence.’ So he did, and then received them with hospitality. He then introduced himself to them saying, `Verily, I have gathered you for something good, and want you to debate with this cousin of mine from medina, who has come tome. Come to me tomorrow morning. None of you should be absent.” They said: “O Commander of the Faithful! We listen and obey you. Allah willing,, we will be here first thing in the morning.” Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said: “We were talking to Abu al-Hasan (AS) when Yasir, the servant who was in the charge of serving Abu al-Hasan, entered and told him, O My Master! Verily, the Commander of the Faithful expressed his greetings to you and said: `May you brother be your ransom! Verily, the rhetoricians, scholars from all religions, and theologians from all nations have all gathered together here with me. Would you like to come to us and have a discussion with them? If you do not wish to do so, do not bother yourself. However, if you prefer, we can come visit you. Abu al-Hasan (AS) then said: “Express my greetings to him, and tell him that I understand what you intend. Allah willing, I will come to you myself tomorrow morning.” Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said; “When Yasir went out, the Imam (AS) turned to me and said: “O Nawfali! You are an Iraqi, and an Iraqi’s heart is not hard. So, what do you think? What is your cousin’s intention in setting up a meeting between me and the pagans and rhetoricians?” Al-Nawfali says I answered, “May I be yoiur ransom! He intends to test you, and wants to know how much knowledge you possess. Verily, he has based his assumption on shaky grounds. By Allah, what he has set up is evil.” The Imam (AS) asked, “And what has he set up?” Al-nawfali said: The heretics and the theologians are different from the learned. That is because a learned does not deny the undeniable, whereas rhetoricians, theologians, and polytheists are people who deny things and try to prove what is not true. If you argue with them and tell them that God is One, they would say, `Confirm His Oneness.’ And if you say that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, they would say, `Prove his Prophethood.’ May I be your ransom! They confuse you and make you disprove your own proofs. They continue to falsify until you back off. Beware of them! May I be your ransom!” Al-Nawfali added, “The Imam (AS) then smiled, and told me, `O Nawfali! Do you fear that they will defeat my arguments?” Al-Nawfali said: `No, by Allah! I have no worries about you. Allah willing, I hope that Allah will make you victorious over them!’ The Imam (AS) asked again, `O Nawfali! Would you like to know when Al-Ma`mun will regret his actions?” He answered, `Yes.’ The Imam (AS) said: When he hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own Torah, with the people of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel with the people of the Psalms quoting their own Psalms, with the Sabians in their own Hebrew language, with the Zoroastrian priests in their own Persian, with the Romans in their own Latin, and with the rhetoricians using their very own languages. So, if I close the avenues of argument in the face of each arguing party and disprove his claim, making him renounce his statement from its onset and referring to my own statement, then al-Ma`mun will realize that he has not achieved what he aspires to achieve. It is then that he will feel regret. And there is no power and no strength save in Allah, the Most High, the Most Great. On the following day, al-Fadl ibn Sahl went in a hurry to see the Imam (AS) and told him, “May I be your ransom! Your cousin is waiting for you. The people have gathered together. When will you go to him?” Al-Rida (AS) told him, “You go ahead, Allah willing, I will come to you.” Then he made ablutions for praying, drank some sawiq, quenched us from it as well, and then we all left. When we reached al-Ma`mun’s place, the meeting was full of people. Muhammad ibn Ja`far, some of the Talibites and Hashimites, and the Commanders of the Army were among those present. When al-Rida (AS) entered, al-Ma`mun stood up, Muhammad ibn Ja`far, and all the Hashimites who were present there, also stood up for him. The Imam (AS) and alMa`mun sat down while all the people were still standing, until al-Ma`mun ordered them to sit down. Al-Ma`mun talked to the Imam for a while. Then al-Ma`mun turned to the Catholicos and said: “O Catholicos! This is my cousin `Ali ibn Musa ibn Ja`far (AS). He is one of the children of Fatimah (AS), the daughter of our Prophet (SA), and `Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS). I would like you to debate with him, but be fair with him.” The Catholicos said: “O Commander of the Faithful! How can I argue with a man who argues with me using a Book I reject, and who believes in a prophet who I do not believe in? Al-Rida (AS) told him, “O Christian! Will you accept to debate with me if I present proofs from your Gospel?” The Catholicos answered, “How could I reject the words of the Bible? I swear to God that I will accept your arguments, even if I dislike them.” Al-Rida (AS) told him, “Ask whatever you wish, and you shall receive an answer.” The Catholicos said: “what is your opinion about the Prophethood of Jesus and his Book? Do you deny either one of them?” Al-Rida (AS) said: I accept the Prophethood of Jesus. I accept his Book. And I accept what he taught his nation, and what was accepted by his disciples. However, I reject the Prophethood of any Jesus who has not professed the Prophethood of Muhammad, his Book, and what he taught his people. The Catholicos said: “Two witnesses are required to validate a testimony. Is that correct?” The Imam (AS) said: “Yes.” The Catholicos Archbishop said: “if that is the case, I challenge you to select who witnesses who are neither Muslim nor Christina, but who do not reject the Prophethood of Muhammad (SA). Likewise, you may ask a similar question from people other than our own nation.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Christian! Now you are speaking fairly. Do you accept a just person who was given preference (over others) by the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary?” The Catholicos replied, “Who is the just one? Name him for me.” The Imam (AS) said: “What is your opinion of John al-Daylami?” The Catholicos responded, “Bravo! Bravo! You have mentioned the person most loved by the Messiah.” The Imam (AS) said: Then I ask you to swear by God, and tell me whether or not the Bible says that John said: `The Messiah has informed me of the religion of Muhammad, the Arab, and has given me the glad tidings about him who will be (a Prophet) after him. Therefore, I have the glad tidings of him to the disciples and they believed in him.’ The Catholicos said: “John did quote this from the Messiah. He did give the glad tidings concerning the coming of a Prophet, his Household, and his Successor. He has not specified when this would happen, and has not named them so that we could identify them.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “If we bring someone here who can recite the Bible, and he recites to you Muhammad’s name, his Household, and his nation, will you believe in him?” The Catholicos replied, “What a sound suggestion!” Al-Rida (AS) turned to Nestus the Roman, and asked hi, “have you memorized the third Book of the Bible?” He answered, “I have thoroughly memorized it.” Then the Imam (AS) addressed the Catholicos and said: “Can you recite the Bible?” The Catholicos said: “Yes, of course.” The Imam said: “Then I will recite to you (some verses from) the third Book. If Muhammad (SA), his Household (AS), and his nation were mentioned in it, then bear witness! And if they have not been mentioned therein, then do not bear witness.” Then the Imam (AS) recited to him some of the verses of the third Book until he reached the reference to the Prophet. He stopped reading and said: “O Christina! I challenge you to swear by the Messiah and his mother. Have you realized that I have knowledge of the Bible?” He replied, “yes.” The Imam (AS) recited to him some verses from the third Book concerning the reference to the Prophet, his Household, and his nation. Then the Imam (AS) said: O Christian! What do you think now? These are the words of Jesus, the son of Mary. If you deny what the Bible says, then you will deny both the Jesus and Moses. If you deny them, then it is incumbent to kill you for blasphemy against your Lord, your Prophet, and your Book. The Catholicos said: “I do not deny the clear things in the Bible. On the contrary, I profess them.” The Imam (AS) asked others who were present, “Bear witness to his profession.” Then the Imam (AS) said to the Catholicos, “O Catholicos! Ask me any other question that you wish to ask.” The Catholicos asked, “What about the disciples of Jesus, the son of Mary? How many were they? And tell me about the scholars of the Bible. How many were then?” Al-Rida (AS) said: You have found the expert! As for (the number of) the disciples, they were twelve men. The best and the most learned of them was Aluqas (Luke). As for the (number of) Christian scholars, there were three men: John (Yohanna), `the great’ at Aj, John at Qirqisiya, and john al-Daylami at Zijan, who made reference to Prophet Muhammad, his Household and his nation. It is he who gave glad tidings to the nation of Jesus and the Children of Israel about him. The Imam (AS) added, “O Christian! By Allah, we believe in Jesus, who believed in Muhammad. We have nothing against Jesus except for his weakness and the paucity of his fasting and prayer. The Catholicos replied, “By Allah, you have corrupted your knowledge! You affair has become weak! I though that you were the most learned of the Muslims!” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “Why?” The Catholicos said: “You said that Jesus was weak in fasting and prayer when, in fact, he never broke fasting during the day, and never slept during the night. He always fasted during the day, and he always prayed throughout the night.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “For whom did he fast and pray?” The Catholicos did no answer, not knowing what to say. Al-Rida (AS) said: “I want to ask you a question.” The Catholicos said: “Ask. I will respond if I have the answer.” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “Why do you deny that Jesus gave life to the dead with the permission of Allah, the Mighty and High?” The Catholicos said: “I deny that because whoever is able to give life to the dead, and to heal the blind and the leprous is a Lord worthy of service.” Al-Rida (AS) said: Very well. However, Elijah [al-Yasa’] performed the same miracles as Jesus did. He walked on water, gave life to the dead, and healed the blind and the leprous Why did his nation not adopt him as a Lord? Why did no anyone worship him as a god other than Allah? The Prophet Ezekiel [Hizqil] did just what Jesus did. He gave life to thirty-five men sixty years after their death. Then the Imam (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and asked him, O Head of the Rabbis! Do you find the following about some of the youth of the Children of Israel in the Torah? When Nebuchadnezzar [Bakht Nasr] invaded Jerusalem, he enslaved the Children of Israel and brought them to Babylonia. Then Allah, the Mighty and High, sent al-Yasa` from them, and he gave life to them. This is in the Torah. No one but an unbeliever of you would deny it. The Head of the Rabbis said: “I have heard about this and know it.” The Imam (AS) said: “You have spoken the truth.” Then the Imam (AS) said: “O Jewish man! See if I read from the following Book of the Torah properly.” The Imam (AS) then recited some of the verses from the Torah for us. The Jewish man, who was surprised at hearing how the Imam (AS) was reciting the Torah, kept moving his body. He then faced the Christian and asked, “O Christian! Were these words revealed before Jesus or were they revealed after him?” The Catholicos answe3red, “They were revealed before him.” Al-Rida (AS) said: The people of Quraysh gathered around the Messenger of Allah (SA) and asked him to give life to their dead. He sent along `Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) with them and told him, “go to the cemetery, and loudly call the people about whom they have asked, say, “O soand-so, so-and-so, etc.” Tell them, “Allah’s Messenger Muhammad says, `Rise with the permission of Allah, the Mighty and High’ Then they all rose and brushed off the dust from their heads.” The people from the tribe of Quraysh walked towards them and asked them about their affairs. They told them that Muhammad (SA) has been raised as a Prophet. The people who had risen from the dead said: “We wish we had lived in his age and believed in him!” He healed the blind, the leprous, and the insane. He spoke with the beasts, the birds, the jinn, and demons. Still, we do not adopt him as a Lord other than Allah, the Mighty and High. We do not deny the miracles of the prophets. Since you have adopted Jesus as a Lord, why do you not adopt al-Yasa` and Hizqil as lords, for they performed the same miracles as did Jesus, the son of Mary, such as giving life to the dead? Moreover, thousands of the Children of Israel left their homeland in fear of death due to the plague. Allah made them die immediately. The people of the village build a fence around them, and left them there until their bones decayed. One of the prophets of the Children of Israel passed by, and he was amazed when he saw so may decayed bones. Allah, the Mighty and high, revealed to him, “Would you like Me to bring them to life so that you can admonish them?” The Prophet said: “Yes, O Lord!” Then Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to him, “Then call them.” He said: “O decayed bones! Rise with Allah’s permission.” They all rose while brushing off the dust from their heads.” Likewise when Abraham (AS), the friend of the Most Compassionate, took the birds, cut them into pieces, and put each piece on a mountain top. He called out to them and they came towards him. Also Moses (AS) the son of `Imran, his companions, and seventy of the men whom he had chosen went to the mountain. They told Moses, “You have seen Allah. So show Him to us like you have seen Him.” Moses told them, “I have not seen Him.” But they said: “We shall never believe in you until we see Allah manifestly.” A thunderbolt struck them, and burned them all up. Only Moses survived. Moses said: `O my Lord! I chose seventy men from among the Children of Israel and brought them to the mountain. Shall I return by myself? How shall my people believe what I must tell them? If You desired You could have destroyed al of us long before. Would you destroy us all for the deeds of the foolish ones among us?’ Then Allah, the Mighty and High, gave life to them after their death. You cannot deny all these things which I have told you, for the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms and the Qur’an have mentioned them. If all those who gave life to the dead, healed the blind, the leprous and the mad, were adopted as lords other than Allah, then you should also adopt them as Lords. O Christians! What is your opinion? The Catholicos said: “Yes. You are right. There is no god but Allah.” Then the Imam (AS) turned towards the Head of Rabbis and told him. O Jewish man! Turn to me. Swear to me by the Ten Commandments which were sent down to Moses, the son of `Imran, that the following statement about the Prophet Muhammad (SA) and his nation is not found in the Torah: When the people of the last nation, who are followers of the Rider of the Camel, who glorifies the Lord enormously, new glorification in new churches (implying mosques), then let the Children of Israel flee towards them and their dominion so that their hearts may be tranquil, since there will be swords in their hands with which they will take revenge on the unbelievers around the globe. Is this not written in the Torah? The Head of the Rabbis said; “Yes, we have found that written in this manner.” Then the Imam (AS) asked the Catholicos, “O Christian! How is your knowledge of the Book of Sha`ya? He answered, “I know it letter by letter.” Then the Imam asked them both, “Do you know that the following statement is made by him, `O people! I have seen the picture of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel, who is as bright as the moon.’” They answered, “Verily, Sha`1ya did say that!” Al-Rida (AS) said: O Christian! Do you know that Jesus said: `I am going to my Lord and your Lord, and the Paraclete [farqilita] is coming who shall testify to my truth just as I testified for him, and he shall explain everything to you, and he shall be the one to expose all the sins of nations, and he shall be the one to smash down the pillars of unbelief?’ The Catholicos said: “We accept whatever you cite from the Bible.” The Imam said: “O Catholicos! Have you found this in the Bible?” The Catholicos said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Catholicos, when you lost the first Bible, with whom did you find it?” The Catholicos said: “We only lost the Bible for one day. Then we found it fresh (in its original state). John and Matthew brought it back to us.” Al-Rida (AS) asked him, How little you know of the Bible and its scholars! If what you say is correct, then why do you have so many disputes between yourselves regarding the Bible? The source of controversy lies in the Bible which you have in your hands today. Had it been the same as the fist Bible, there would be no dispute over it, However, I will prove this for you myself. Know that when the first Bible was lost, the Christians gathered around their scholars and said to them, `Jesus the son of Mary has been killed, and we have lost the Bible. You are the scholars. What do you have?’ Luke, Mark and John told them, `We have memorized the Bible. Do not worry about it. Do not forsake the churches. We will recite each Gospel of the Bible for you on each Sunday until we put it all together.’ Then Luke, Mark, John and Matthew gathered together and put together this Bible after you had lost the first one. These four students were of the first students. Did you know that?” The Catholicos said: “I did not know this before. Now I have learned it from you due to your noble knowledge of the Bible. I heard things from you which I knew deep down, and which my heart acknowledges to be the truth. As a result, I have grown in understanding.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Do you accept the evidence I have presented?” The Catholicos said: “I completely accept the evidence as correct, and bear witness that it is true.” Al-Rida (AS) then told al-Ma’mun, his family, and the others who were present, “Be witnesses to this.” They said: “We bear witness.” Then the Imam (AS) told the Catholicos, I swear by the Son and his Mother to tell us whether you know that Matthew said the following, `The Messiah is the son of David, the son of Abraham, the son of Issac, the son of Jacob, the son of Yehuda, the son of Khadrun.’ Mark said the following regarding the lineage of Jesus, the son of Mary, `He is Allah’s Word placed in the human body. So it turned into the human form.’ Moreover, Luke said: `Jesus the son of Mary and his mother wee humans made of flesh and blood. Then the Holy Sprit entered into them.’ Testify as well that Jesus said the following about himself, `O disciples! I will tell you the truth. No one will ascend to Heaven, except for him who descends there from, except for the Rider of the Camel, the Seal of the Prophets, for he will ascend to the Heavens, and then will descend therefrom. What do you have to say about that? The Catholicos said; “These are the words of Jesus. We do not deny them.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “If so, what do you say about the testimonies of Luke, Mark and Matthew regarding Jesus and the lineage they attributed to him?” The Catholicos said: “They ascribed likes to Jesus.” Al-Rida (A) said: “O people! Did he not just bear witness that they (Luke, Mark and Matthew) are the Scholars of the Bible, and what they said was the truth?” The Catholicos said: “O Scholar of the Muslims! I would like you to excuse me from discussing about these men.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Fine, I will excuse you from that, O Christian! Ask me whatever you wish to ask.” The Catholicos said: “Let someone else ask you questions. By Jesus, I did not think that there was a scholar like you among the Muslims.” Al-Rida (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and said: “Will you ask me questions or should I ask?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “I will ask. However, I will not accept any proofs from you except those form the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms of David, or the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Do not accept any of my proofs unless they are from the Torah as expressed by Moses, the son of `Imran, the Bible as expressed by Jesus, the son of Mary, or the Psalms of David as expressed by David.” The Head of the Rabbis said: “How can you prove the Prophethood of Muhammad (SA)?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Moses, the son of `Imran, Jesus, the son of Mary and David, the Vicegerent of Allah on the Earth, have testified to his Prophethood.” The Head of the Rabbis said: “Provide evidence of the testimony of Moses, the son of `Imran.” Al-Rida (AS) told him, O Jewish man! Do you know that Moses said the following to the Children of Israel, `A prophet will come to you fro among your brethren. Believe in him, and obey him.’ Do you know that the Children of Israel have no brethren other than the Children of Ishamel? Do you know about the ties of kinship between Israel and Ishmael and the relationship that existed between them from the past through Abraham? The Head of the Rabbis said: “These are the words of Moses. I do not deny them.” Al-Rida (AS) asked him, “Has any Prophet other than Muhammad (SA) come from among the brethren of the Children of Israel?” He replied, “No.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Is this not correct in your opinion?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “Yes, but I want you to prove its correctness from the Torah.” Al-Rida (AS) asked him, “Do you deny that the Toray says the following to you? `There came light from Mount Sinai. Light shined upon us from Mount Sa`ir and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran.’” The Head of the Rabbis said: “I am familiar with these words, but I do not know what they mean.” Al-Rida (AS) said: I will inform you about them. What is meant when it says `There came light from Mount Sinai` is a reference to the revelations of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, to Moses on mount Sinai. And what is meant when it says, `Light shined upon us from Mount Sa`ir’ is a reference to the mountain upon which Allah, the Mighty and High, sent revelations of Jesus, the son of Mary. Jesus was on that mountain. And what is meant when it says, `and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran.’ Faran is a mountain that is one day away from Mecca. As you and your friends said: the Prophet Sha`ya has said in the Torah that `I have seen the picture of the Rider of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel, who is as bright as the moon.’ Who is the Rider of the Donkey? Who is the Rider of the Camel? The Head of the Rabbis said: “I do not know who they are.” The Imam (AS) said: “The Rider of the Donkey is Jesus, and the Rider of the Camel is Muhammad (SA). Do you deny that this is from the Torah?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “No, I do not deny that.” Then al-Rida (AS) said: “Do you know the Prophet Hayqua?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “Yes, I know him.” The Imam (AS) said: He said the following which your Book has also stated, `Allah brought down the Bayan from Mount Faran. The heavens are filled with the praise of Ahmad and his nation. He will lead his troops at sea just as he carries them on land. He will bring us a new Book after the destruction of the Holy House (in Jerusalem).’ Did you know the, and do you believe in it? The Head of the Rabbis said: “In fact, the Prophet Hayquq has said this. I will not deny his words. Al-Rida (AS) said: David said in his Psalms which you have also read, `O my Allah! Appoint him who will establish the practice after the cessation (of the prophets). Did you know of any prophet other than Muhammad (SA) who has established the practice after the end of the period of prophecy? The Head of the Rabbis said: “this is what David said. We do not deny it. However, he was referring to Jesus, as it was with him that the age of prophecy came to a close.” Al-Rida (AS) told him, You are wrong. In fact, Jesus endorsed the practices [sunah] of the Torah until Allah raised him up to Himself. It is written in the Bible. The son of the pious woman will go, and the Paraclete will come after him. It is he who will preserve the bonds, explain everything to you, and testify to my truth just as I testified for him. I have brought you the examples, and he will bring you the interpretations. Do you believe that this statement is in the Bible? The Head of the Rabbis said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) replied to him, “O the Head of the Rabbis! I want to ask you about your Prophet Moses.” The Jewish man said: “He brought miracles which the prophets before him had not brought.” The Imam (AS) asked, “Could you give me an example?” The Head of the Rabbis replied, “He split the sea, turned the cane into a slithering serpent, made springs gush from stones, showed his hand white and shining to the onlookers, and other signs the like of which other creatures were unable to bring.” Al-Rida (AS) replied to him, “You are right. They are proofs of his Prophethood. He brought the like of which other creatures were unable to brig. Is it obligatory on you to believe in whoever claims Prophethood, and performs something which all other creatures are unable to perform?” The head of the Rabbis said: “No, since there is no one like Moses considering his position near his Lord and his closeness to Him. It is not incumbent upon us to profess the Prophethood of whoever claims it, unless he brings us miracles similar to those brought by Moses. The Imam (AS) said: Then how come you admit the Prophethood of the other prophets who preceded Moses who did not split the sea; nor did they make twelve springs gush forth from the stones, nor did they show a white shining hand as Moses did, nor did they turn the came into a slithering serpent. The Jewish man replied: I told you that if they performed miracles as evidence for their Prophethood which all other creatures were unable to perform, and if they brought something the like of which Moses had brought, or they followed what Moses had brought, then it is incumbent upon us to believe in them. Al-Rida (AS) replied to him, “O Head of the Rabbis! What has prevented you from professing (the Prophethood of) Jesus, the son of Mary? Jesus brought the dead to life, healed the blind and the leprous, made birds formed of clay and breathed life into them with Allah’s permission.’” The Head of the Rabbis said: “It is said that he did that but we did not see it.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Have you seen the miracles performed by Moses? Have you not received the news by way of Moses’s closest trustworthy companions who said he did them?” The Head of the Rabbis said: “Yes. That is so.” The Imam (AS) said: “Well. The news about the miracles of Jesus, the son of Mary, have reached you in a similar fashion. Why then did you acknowledge Moses and believe in him, but you did not believe in Jesus?” The Head of the Rabbis did not answer. Al-Rida (AS) said: The same is true about Muhammad (SA) and his miracles. The same is true about any other prophet (AS) appointed by Allah. One of the miracles of Muhammad (SA) was that he was a poor hired shepherd. He had not been taught anything. He did not have any teachers. However, the Qur’an which he brought contains the stories of the prophets and the associated news letter by letter. It has narrated news of the past, and the things to come in the future all the way up until the Day of Resurrection. The Qur’an provided information about what people did in hiding or in their homes. The Prophet brought innumerable miracles. The Head of the Rabbis said: “Neither the account about Jesus nor that about Muhammad (SA) is considered correct by us. It is not permissible to admit their Prophethood through what is not correct.” Al-Rida (AS said: “Has the witness who testified for Jesus (AS) and Muhammad (SA) then given false testimony?” The Head of the Rabbis did not answer him. Then the Imam (AS) called the Zoroastrian High Priest. Al-Rida (AS) said to him, “Let me know about Zoroaster who considered himself to be a prophet. What is your proof of his Prophethood?” The Zoroastrian High Priest said: “He performed miracles which no one ever had performed before him. Of course, I have not seen him, but the stories of our ancestors tell us that he made legitimate for us things which others had not made legitimate. Therefore, we follow him.” The Imam (AS) asked, “You believed in the stories which came to you about him, so you followed him, did you not?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: This is the case with all other nations. Stories came to them about what the prophets had accomplished, and what Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (AS) had all brought to them. So why did you not believe in any of these prophets, having believed in Zoroaster through the stories that came to you about him saying that he brought forth what others did not? The Zoroastrian High Priest froze in his place. Then al-Rida (AS) said: “O people! If any of you is opposed to Islam, and wants to ask me any questions, then they should ask me and not be shy.” `Imran the Sabian, who was an expert in theology, stood up and said: O Scholar of the people! I would not have asked you any questions if you had not invited me to ask. I have been to Kufa, Basra, Syria, and Algeria. There I have met many theologians. However, none of them have been able to establish for me the proof that there is One who has no second other than Him, and that he is One Sole Being. Will you permit me to ask you this question? Al-Rida (AS) said: “If `Imran the Sabian is present among the people here, it must be you.” He said: “Yes. It is I.” The Imam (AS) said: “O `Imran! Ask, but I advise you to be fair. Avoid vain talk and nonsense.” `Imran said: “My Master! By Allah, I just want you to prove something which I can adhere to for me. Then I need not seek anything else.” The Imam (AS) said: “Ask whatever you wish to ask.” The crowds moved closer to `Imran and crowded in on him. `Imran the Sabian asked, “let me know of the first thing and what it created.” Al-Rida (AS) replied to him. You asked. Now try to understand. As for the One. He has always been One Being. He has no limits nor does He have transient qualities. He will always remain so. Then, without precedence, He created a different creature with transient qualities and various different limits. He neither places it in anything, not did He limit it by anything. He neither created it like anything, nor did He create other things like it. He then created the creatures in various shapes: pure and impure, different and alike, with various colors, flavors and tastes. He did not create them out of a need for them, nor did He create them to attain a higher rank. He did not sense any increase or decrease in Himself due to this creation. O `Imran! Do you understand this? `Imran said: “By Allah, yes my Master!” The Imam (AS) added, O `Imran! Know that if He had created what He created due to His need for them, then He would have only created things by which He could fulfill His need. In that case, it would have been better for Him to create several times more than what He created, since the more the helpers there were, the more powerful their master would be. O `Imran! In that case, His need would be a never-ending one. The more He would crate, the more newer needs would appear for Him. That is why we say that He did not create the creatures out of need. Through creation He transfers the needs of some of them to others. And He makes some of them nobler than others without any need of the nobler one or without wanting to take any revenge against those whom He had abased. That is how He has created. `Imran asked, “My Master! Was the Being known to Himself by His Own Self?” Al-Rida (AS) said: Knowledge of something is required to distinguish it from other things, and to prove its existence through what is negated about it. However, there was nothing else there to oppose Him to make it necessary to negate. Since there was only Him, there was no need to establish limits. O `Imran Do you understand? `Imran said: “Yes, by Allah, my Master! Then tell me: Through what means did He come to know what He knew. Was it done by conscience or by something else?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “If His Knowledge was acquired through conscience. Can we place any limit to His Conscience, which will end in recognition? `Imran answered, “there is no way out.” The Imam (AS) then asked him, “Then what is that conscience?” `Imran could not provide any answer. Al-Rida (AS) said: Never mind. O `Imran! If I now ask you about that conscience and whether you can recognize it through another conscience, an you answer in the affirmative, have you not then disproved your own statement and claim? O `Imran! Is it not more proper for you to know that the One cannot be described by a conscience? And that the most that can be said about Him is that He has done something, or created something? He is not such that one can conceive any directions or parts for Him as can be imagined for the creatures and their parts. Understand this and base your proper knowledge on it. `Imran asked, “O my Master! Can you let me know what types of limits His creatures have? What are their meanings? And how many varieties of creatures has He created?” The Imam (AS) said: You asked. Now understand. In fact, there are six types of limits for His Creatures. These are the unsubtle; the weighable; the visible; those that have no weight, that is, the spirit; those that are visible but are without any weight, are untouchable, subtle, colorless, and tasteless; and the measurable that are the widths, the forms, width and height. Included among them are deeds and movements which make things, act upon them, change them from one state to another, increase them or reduce them. As for deeds and movements, they pass by since they have no more time than that which is ordained for their need. Whenever a deed is finished and the movement is stopped it ends, but its effects remain just like talking, which ends but its effect remains. `Imran said: “O my Master! Will you let me know about the Creator? If He is One, there is nothing other than Him, and there is nothing with Him, has He not changed (His Essence) by creating the creatures?” Al-Rida (AS) told him, “The Mighty and High does not change through the creation of creatures. The creatures, however, change, due to the changes He has subjected them to.” `Imran asked, “O my Master! By means of what can we recognize Him\u003E” Al-Rida (AS) said: “By means of other than Him.” `Imran asked, “What is other than Him,” Al-Rida (AS) said: “His Will, His Name, His Attribute, and everything else that was created, has emerged and is managed (by Him).” `Imran said: “O my Master! Then what is He?” The Imam (AS) replied, “He is Light. That means that He guided His Creatures from among the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. You have no rights incumbent upon me more than my professing His Unity to you.” `Imran said: “O my Master! Was He not silent before creating the creatures, and then He spoke?” Al-Rida (AS) said: Silence doe not exist unless there is some utterance before it. An example of this is that it is not said that the lamp is silent and does not utter; not is it said that the lamp shines, implying that it want to do something to us. The light shining from the lamp is not considered to be the act of the lamp. It is not something separate from the lamp. Therefore, when it is illuminating us we say that it was lit for us, by which we found our way around. Through this example you can find what you are after and become enlightened in your affairs. `Imran said: “O my Master! I though that the Ever-Existent changed His State through the act of creation.” Al-Rida (AS) said: O `Imran! You claim that the Ever-Existent Being can change in some way as a result of His Action. O `Imran! Have you ever seen that the changes in fire change it? Have you ever seen heat burn itself? Have you ever seen an eye see itself? `Imran said: “No, I have not. O my Master! Will you let me know whether He is in the creatures or the creatures are in Him?” Al-Rida (AS) said: O `Imran! He is greater than that. He is not in the creatures; not are the creatures in Him. He is Exalted above that. I will teach you what you do not know. There is no power and no strength save Allah. Tell me about the mirror: are you in it or is it in you? O `Imran! If neither one of you are in the other; then, how can you see your reflection in it? `Imran said; “Through the light between me and the mirror.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Can you see more light in the mirror than what you perceive with your own eyes?” He answered, “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Then show it to us!” It was then that the man was too baffled to say a word. The Imam (AS) said: “I do not see the light except that it leads to both of you, the mirror and yourself, without being in either one of you. There are many more examples which the ignorant simply cannot comprehend. Allah is the highest such example.” Then the Imam (AS) turned to al-Ma`mun and told him, “It is time to pray.” `Imran said: “O my Master! Do not interrupt my questions since I am feeling inclined towards you in my heart.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “We will pray and come back.” Then the Imam (AS) stood up. Al-Ma`mun got up as well. Al-Rida (AS) prayed inside and the people prayed outside, led by Muhammad ibn Ja`far. Then the Imam (AS) came out, returned to the meeting called out to `Imran, and said: “O `Imran! Ask your questions.” `Imran said: “O my Master! Will you let me know whether the Unity of Allah, the Mighty and High, is perceived through reality or through description?” Al-Rida (AS) said: Certainly, Allah is the Only Initiator and the first Ever-Being. He has always been One without anything to accompany Him. He is the Peerless, and there is no second with Him. He is neither definite nor indefinite. He is neither decisive nor allegorical. He is neither mentioned nor forgotten. No name can describe Him. Time cannot measure His beginning. And time cannot measure His End. He has not been standing upon anything else, nor will He be standing upon anything. There is nothing which supports Him. There is nothing on which He leans. He has all these attributes before creating anything, when there was nothing but Him. Whatever you attribute to Him will be originated attributes which are the only means for understanding Him, which anyone possessing understanding can comprehend. Know that innovation, will, and intent are different words that express the same meaning. His foremost innovation, intent and will were the letters which He established as the origin of everything, the evidence for all perceived things, and the separator for all vague things. Everything was separated by these letters; thing such as the names for right and wrong, action and object, meaning and meaningless. All affairs were run based on them. He did not establish any limited meaning for them other than what they were themselves when He originated the letters. He did not establish for them any existence other than themselves since they were originated via innovation. Light is Allah’s first action. He is the Light of the heavens and the earth. It was through that action that the letters became object. They are the letters upon which speech is based. Expressions are all from Allah, the Mighty and High, who taught them to His Creatures. There are thirty-three letters. Twenty-eight of them are the letters on which the Arabic language is based. Twenty-two of Twenty-eight letters show the letters of the Assyrian and Hebrew languages. Five of them were separated, and are in the rest of the languages of non-Arabs in the regions. These are the five letters which were separated from the twenty-eight letters. Therefore, there are thirty-three letters. It is not permissible to mention more about them than what we have mentioned regarding these fie letters which were separated. He then established the letters after counting them and numbering them as His own action, like the Word of the Mighty and High: `Be,’ and it is. Here `be’ refers to His Creation, and `what is created’ refers to the creature. Thus, the first creation by Allah, the Mighty and High, is innovation which has neither weight nor any movement. It is neither heard nor does it have color or touch. And the second thing that was created are the letters which have neither weight nor color. They are neither heard nor described. They are not visible. The third creature includes all the various kinds of things which are perceptible, touchable, tasteable, and visible. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, existed before innovation as there has been nothing before the Mighty and High, and nothing with him. Innovation was created before the letters were created, and the letters do not indicate anything other than themselves. Al-Ma`mun asked, “How come they do not indicate anything other than themselves?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, never combines any of them together unless to mean something, When He combines several letters together, say four, five or six or more, He uses them to originate a new meaning which did not exist before.” `Imran asked, “How can we understand them?” Al-Rida (AS) said: This is how it can be understood. When you only want to refer to the letters and not anything else, you mention them one by one and say, a b c d … to the end. Here you find no meaning in them other than themselves. But when you put several letters together y construct names and attributes for a meaning which you have in mind. They will not demonstrate the meaning for which they were intended. Did you understand this? `Imran said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: Know that an attribute cannot be without what it describes. Also, a name cannot be without a meaning. A limit cannot be without the limited. All attributes and names indicate perfection and existence. They do not indicate encompassment, as the limits do. Limits make squares, make triangles, and make hexagons. Verily, the recognition of Allah, the Mighty and High, is perceived by attributes and names, not by limits such as length, width, smallness, largeness, color, weight, and the like. No such limits are applicable to Allah, the High and the All-Holy, so that His creatures could recognize Him by recognizing themselves. This is certain as I said: but the attributes of Allah, the Mighty and High, prove Him. He can be understood through His Names. He can be reasoned upon by referring to His creatures. A true seeker doe not need to see Him with his own eyes, hear Him with his own ears, touch Him with his own hands, or encompass Him with his own heart. Were it not the case that His attributes proved Him, Exalted is His Praise, and His Names denoted Him, it was not possible for the taught knowledge of the creatures to perceive Him. Then the creatures would have worshipped His Names and Attributes instead of His meaning. Were it any different, the only worshipped one would have been other than Allah, the Exalted, since his Attributes and Names are other than Him. Did you understand?” `Imran said: “Yes, my Master, Please tell me more.” Al-Rida (AS) said: Beware of the saying of the ignorant ones, those whose hearts are blind, and who are in loss. They are those who claim that Allah, the Mighty and High and the All-Holy, is present in the hereafter for the Reckoning concerning rewards and punishments, but He is not present in this world for the acts of obedience and hope.’ If it were that Allah, the Mighty and High’s, presence was a source of His being defective in this world. He would not be present in the Hereafter either. However, these people have gone astray and have become blind and deaf towards the truth regarding what they do not know. That is the Word of the Mighty and High: But whosoever is blind in this (world), he shall also be blind in the Hereafter, and more erring from the way, i.e. blindness from existing realities. Intellectuals know that reasoning about what exists in the Hereafter is only possible through what exists in this world. Whoever tries to adopt knowledge of that world based upon his own personal views, and seek its existence, or tries to perceive it through his own soul and not through anything else would only get more distant from the facts about that world. That is because Allah, the Mighty and High, has given the knowledge of that world to a special group of people who think, know, and understand. `Imran asked, “O My Master, please inform me: Is innovation a created being or not?” Imam al-Rida (AS) answered, It is still creation which cannot be perceived through stillness. It is a created being since it has emerged. And it is Allah who made it emerged. Thus, it has become a creature. In other words, there only exist Allah, the Mighty and High, and His Creatures. There exists no third thing in between, and there is no third thing other than them. Whatever Allah, the Mighty and High, creates dos not disobey from being His Creature. What is crated is ether still, moving, different, harmonious, known, or ambiguous. Whatever is bounded is the creature of Allah, the Mighty and High. Moreover, know that all the things which the senses find for you are meanings perceived by the senses, and every sense demonstrates what Allah, the Mighty and High, has placed in its perception, and the heart understands all of that. Know that the One who is Ever-Standing without any ordination or bounds created creatures ordained by bounds and ordination. What He created were two creatures: the ordination and the ordained. Neither one had any color, taste or weight. He established one as the means of perceived the other and made them such that they could be perceived on their own. He did not create anything which could stand alone relying only on itself, so as to provide a means for arguing about and proving His Existence. Thus, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is Peerless and One. There is no second to support Him in order to enable Him to stand, or to assist Him or protect Him. However, the creatures support one another through the permission and will of Allah. People have differences of opinion over this subject to the extent that they have gone astray, become perplexed, and seek salvation from darkness by means of darkness through describing Allah using their own qualities. In this way, they have strayed far from the truth. Had they described Allah, the Mighty and High, using His Attributes, and described the creatures with the qualities of the creatures, they would have spoken through understanding and certitude and would not have come up with so many differences of opinion over Him. Since they sought what would perplex them, they entrapped themselves and became confused. Allah guides whomsoever He wills to the Straight Path. `Imran said: “O my Master! I bear witness that He is just as you have described. However, I still have one more question to ask.” The Imam (AS) said: “Ask whatever you wish to ask.” `Imran said: “I want to ask you what the All-Wise is contained in. Has anything encompassed Him? Does He change from one state to another? Is He in need of anything?” Al-Rida (AS) said: O `Imran! I will tell you, so understand. The one whom you question is the most ambiguous issue which the creatures face. As for those who are deficient in understanding, they do not recognize Him. As for those who are just and can reason, they are not incapable of understanding Him. First of all, if He had created the creatures due to need, then it would be proper to say that He changes His location to the location of what He creates because of His need for them. However, the Mighty and High, has not created anything out of need. He is always stable, neither in something, nor on something. However, it is the creatures which hold each other, enter into one another, and leave one another. Allah, the Mighty and High and the All-Holy, holds all of that by his Might. He does not enter anything and does not leave anything. Its preservation does not tire Him, nor is He incapable of holding it. None of the creatures know how that is, except for Allah, the Mighty and high, and His Messengers, the people who know His Secrets, those who run the affairs, and His Guardians who carry out His laws. In fact, His command is like the twinkling of an eye, or even closer that that. If He wills a thing, He only says to it `Be,’ and it is, according to His Will and Intent. Nothing that he has created is closer to Him than any other thing, nor is He father away from anything than another. O `Imran Have you understood? `Imran said: “Yes, my Master. I have understood. I bear witness that Allah is as you described Him to be and as you have described His Unity. I also bear witness that Muhammad is His Servant, who is appointed to guide and lead to the right religion.” He then faced the direction of Mecca, and fell into prostration. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said: When the other rhetoricians heard what `Imran the Sabian said, who was very hard to defeat in arguments and no one had ever defeated him before in arguments, not of them dared approach al-Rida (AS), and they asked him no more questions. It became nightfall. Then al-Ma`mun and al-Rida stood up, went inside and the people left. I was sitting alone with some of my friends when Muhammad ibn Ja`far called me in. I went to see him. He asked me, “O Nawfali! Did you see what your friend (the Imam) did?” Al-Nawfali replied, “No, by Allah! I did not think that `Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS) could plumb such depths. We did not know him in this way. He never spoke about theology in Medina, and theologians never gathered around him.” I further said: “The pilgrims used to come to him and ask him about the lawful and the unlawful and he answered them. Sometimes rhetoricians came to him and argued with him.” Muhammad ibn Ja`far said: “O Abu Muhammad, I fear that this man (al-Ma`mun) will envy him, poison him or inure him. So advise him to refrain from these things.” Al-Nawfali added, “He will not listen to me. This man (al-Ma`mun) only intended to test him to see whether he possesses the knowledge of his forefathers.” He said to me, “Tell him that his uncle does not like him to do such things, and wants him to stop them for different characteristics.” When we returned to Al-Rida’s house, I related to him the message from his uncle. Then the Imam smiled and said: “May Allah protect my uncle. I know him well. Why is he upset? Young man! Go to `Imran the Sabian, and bring him here.” I said: “May I be your ransom! I know where he is. He is with some of the Shi`ite brethren.” The Imam (AS) said: “Do not worry. Get a horse for him to ride on, and bring him here.” I went and brought `Imran. The Imam welcomed him, and asked for a robe of honor which he (AS) put on `Imran. The Imam also gave him a horse, and asked for ten thousand dinars which he (AS) donated to `Imran. `Imran said: “May I be your ransom! You have followed in the footsteps of your grandfather, the Commander of the Faithful (AS).” The Imam (AS) said: “We prefer this.” Then the Imam (AS) ordered dinner, had me sit on his right side, and had `Imran sit on his left side. After eating dinner, the Imam (AS) told `Imran, “Go now and come back in the morning. Then I will give you food from medina.” From then do many people came to `Imran to debate. He used to respond to their arguments and disprove them until they left. Al-Ma`mun granted him ten thousand dirhams. Al-Fadl also gave him some money. Then he appointed him as the director over the alms in (the city of) Balkh where he attained much good.",

    "englishText": "1. Abu Muhammad al-Qasim ibn al-’Ala’, may Allah grant him blessings, in a marfu‘ manner (rafa’aاu), has narrated the following from ‘Abd al-’Aziz ibn Muslim: “We had been with al-Rida (a.s.) at Merv. During an assembly in the central mosque on Friday, we attended the gathering. It was when we had just arrived (in Merv). People spoke and discussed about the issue of Imamate (Leadership with Divine Authority). All the differing opinions among people in this matter came up. \u003Cbr\u003E I then went to see my master, (Imam Rida (a.s.)) and informed him of the people’s disagreements over the issue (leadership). The Imam (a.s.) smiled and then said the following: “O ’Abd al-’Aziz (Ibn Muslim), people are ignorant and their opinions have mislead and deceived them. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, did not cause His Holy Prophet to leave this world before completing for him the religion. Allah sent him the Holy Quran in which all things are clearly explained. Allah has explained in the Holy Quran what is lawful and what is unlawful. He has explained totally the limits and the rules for all issues that people may face in the affairs of life. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has said, 'We have left nothing without a mention of it in the Book...' (Quran 6:38) \u003Cbr\u003E During the last visit of the Holy Prophet to Mecca for pilgrimage towards the end of his life the following verse of the Holy Quran was sent to him: 'On this day I have perfected your religion, completed My favors to you, and have chosen Islam as your religion...' (Quran 5:3) The issue of Imamate (leadership) is part of the completion of religion. The Holy Prophet (s.a.) did not leave this world before explaining to his followers the principles of their religion and show them the path clearly, and he left them on a point of a path that faced the direction of the truth. \u003Cbr\u003E He raised Ali (a.s.) among them as a flag and Imam (a leader). He did not leave anything that his followers needed without full explanation. Those who think that Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has not completed His religion, they rejected the book of Allah and those who reject the book of Allah they have become unbelievers in it. Do they know the value and the status of the Imamate of the ’Umma (the nation) to find out if their selecting an Imam is justifiable and permissible? Imamate in fact, is the most sublime in values, greatest in position, highest in status and the most exclusive issue in all aspects. It is the most profound issue and much more meaningful than the extent of the intellect of the people to reach. It is beyond the grasp of their opinions to appoint an Imam or select him. \u003Cbr\u003E Imamate is that particular distinction which Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has distinguished Ibrahim, the very close friend (al-Khalil), after Prophethood. This close friendship is the third stage (in the progression of spiritual degrees). It is a virtue with which, He honored him and established his fame. He then said, 'Behold! I have made you an Imam for the people.' Ibrahim, the close friend, then out of delight pleaded 'Please let it (Imamate) be in my offspring also.' Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, said, 'My covenant does not go to the unjust ones.' (Quran 2:124) Thus, this verse has declared the leadership (Imamate) of all the unjust ones as unlawful till the Day of Judgment and it has established it for those clean and free of evil and injustice. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, bestowed him more honors in establishing Imamate in purified and clean persons of his offspring. Allah has said 'We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a gift and helped both of them to become righteous people (Quran 21:72). We appointed them as leaders to guide the people through Our command and sent them revelation to strive for good deeds, worship their Lord, and pay religious tax. Both of them were Our worshipping servants.” (21:73) \u003Cbr\u003E So the Imamate remained in his offspring inheriting it from each other, generation after generation, until Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, made Prophet Muhammad (s.w) to inherit it. And He, Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, said, 'The nearest people to Abraham, among mankind, are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad) and the true believers. God is the Guardian of the true believers.' (Quran 3:68) So the Imamate belonged to him particularly, and he (s.w), then, entrusted Imam Ali (a.s.) with it by the command of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, as He had made it obligatory. It then came to be in his (Ali’s) purified and clean of sins offspring, to whom Allah has given knowledge and faith, as in the words of He Who is Most High. “Those who have received knowledge and have faith will say, 'By the decree of God, you have remained for the exact period which was mentioned in the Book of God about the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not know.' (Quran 30:56) Imamate will remain in the sons of Imam Ali (a.s.) exclusively, till the Day of Judgment and there will no prophet after Muhammad (s.w). \u003Cbr\u003E Where from then, have these ignorant people received the right to select Imams? Imamate is, certainly, the position of the prophets, and the inheritance of the successors. Imamate indeed, is the representation (Khilafa) of Allah and the deputy of the Messenger (s.w), and the office of Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.) and the inheritance of Imam al-Hasan and al-Husayn (a.s.). Verily, Imamate is the reins of the religion, the system of the Muslims, the rectification of the world, and the honor of the believers. Indeed, Imamate is the foundation of vibrant Islam, and its noble branch. Through the Imam, the prayer, alms, fasting, pilgrimage, jihad, providing for the needy, charity, upholding boundaries and laws, and safeguarding frontiers and borders are ensured. \u003Cbr\u003E The Imam declares as lawful what Allah has done so and prohibits what Allah has prohibited. He enforces the criminal laws of Allah, defends the religion of Allah and he provides guidance with wisdom, good advice and with the topmost strong evidence. The Imam is like the risen sun that beautifies the world with its light and is in the horizon above the harm of hands and eyes. The Imam is as the bright moon, the shining lamp, the brilliant light, and the guiding star in the depth of darkness, in the middle of the towns, in the wilderness and the high seas. The Imam is as crystal-clear water to thirst, an indicator of true guidance and the protector against destruction. The Imam is as fire of a lighthouse that provides warmth and guidance for those who seek heat protection against fatalities. Whoever would depart him would perish. The Imam (in terms of blessings) is as the rain-bearing cloud, the drenching rainfall, the shining sun, the shadow providing sky, the open fields, the gushing forth spring, as a pond and a garden. The Imam is as a comforting friend, a very kind father, a real brother, a tender-hearted mother of a small child, a refuge for people in disastrous conditions. The Imam is Allah’s trustee over His creatures, His authority over His servants, His representative in His lands, the preacher of His cause and the defender of His sanctuary. The Imam is clean of sins, free of faults, possesses special knowledge and is distinguished in forbearance. The Imam maintains law and order in religion. He is the might of the Muslims that enrages the hypocrites, and exterminates the unbelievers. The Imam is the peerless person of his time, no-one can reach even near his rank in virtue and no scholar is comparable to him. No one can become A number of our people has narrated from alternative for him, nor is there anyone similar to him or just like him. His is exclusive in all virtues of which none is acquired or is sought after, in fact, his virtues are all from bestowed up on him by the source of all virtue, the Generous One (Allah). \u003Cbr\u003E Who is he that can know all about the Imam, or can select him? To affirm the ability of selection is very far from the truth. (In the task of recognizing the Imam) Intellects have become confused, understanding has lost the meaning, awareness is frustrated, eyes have become dull and tired, the great ones have become humble, the sagacious ones have become bewildered and people of forbearance have lost patience. (In the task of recognizing the Imam) The orators have become speechless, the intelligent ones have become ignorant and the poets have become exhausted. The men-of-letter have become helpless, people of eloquence have turned wordless to speak of any of the aspects of his status or a virtue of his virtues and instead have confessed their helplessness in the matter. How can one speak of him in full, or describe him in the real sense or understand anything of his affairs or find an alternative for him sufficient for what he sufficed. There is no such thing and nowhere such is found. He is like a star away from the reach of those who try to reach, or those who try to describe. \u003Cbr\u003E Where does the idea of selecting him would then stand in such case? How can then reasons and intellects reach him and where can one find a person like the Imam? “Would they think that such a person can be found outside the family of the Holy Prophet (s.w)? Their souls, I swear by Allah, have told them a lie. Falsehood has induced in them evil hopes. Be on your guard against an uphill and crushing battle in which they would slip back to their first foothold. They intend to raise the Imam by their confused, fruitless and faulty intellects and their misleading opinions. It would do to nothing good for them. Instead it will take them away from the truth , as Allah has said 'May Allah be their adversary. Where are they headed?' (Quran 9:30) They have aimed at a difficult task and have spoken something meaningless. They have strayed far away from the truth and have faced huge confusions. They have knowingly ignored the Imam (a.s.). It is just as Allah has said: 'Satan has made their deeds to seem attractive to them and has blocked them from reaching the path (of guidance) when they know it fully.' (Quran 29:38) They have turned from the choice that Allah and His Messenger and his family made for them, due to their own choice. The Holy Quran calls up on them, 'Your Lord creates and chooses (to grant mercy) to whomever He wants. (In matters of guidance) they (unbelievers) do not have the choice to choose whatever they want. God is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else.' (Quran 28:68) It also says, “The believing men and women must not feel free to do something in their affairs other than that which has been already decided for them by God and His Messenger. One who disobeys God and His Messenger is in plain error. (Quran 33:36) It further says, “What is the matter with you? How could you judge this to be so? (Quran 68:36). Do you have a book from which you study (Quran 68:37) that tells you to do whatever you want? (Quran 68:38). Do you have a covenant with Us which allows you to do whatever you want until the Day of Judgment? (Quran 68:39). (Muhammad), ask which of them can guarantee that on the Day of Judgment (68:40) they will receive the same thing that the Muslims will? Do they have any witness to such an agreement? Let them bring out such witness, if they are truthful.' (Quran 68:41). Allah says 'Is it that they do not think about the Quran or are their hearts sealed?' (Quran 47:24) Or as it says, '…their hearts were sealed and they were left with no understanding.' (Quran 9:87) or like, 'Do not be like those who said that they have heard (the Messenger’s commands) but do not pay any attention to them (Quran 8:21). The most wicked beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb who have no understanding (Quran 8:22). Had they possessed any virtue, God would certainly have made them hear. Even if God were to make them hear, they would still turn away from (the words of God).' (Quran 8:23) or 'You said that you had listened but you disobeyed.' (Quran 2:93) It is the grace from Allah and He gives to whoever He wills. Allah is possesses great generosity. (Quran 57:21) How would they have the right to choose the Imam (a.s.)? \u003Cbr\u003E The Imam (a.s.) is a scholar that is not ignorant of any thing, a shepherd who does not step back from his duty. He is the source of holiness, of purity, noble tradition (the force) of restraint from sins, knowledge and worship. He (enjoys) the blessings of the exclusive prayers of the Messenger of Allah and of being of the progeny of the Holy Lady, al-Batul (Fatima (a.s.)). There is no question about his genealogical purity. He is of the house of Quraysh and the foremost in the clan of Hashim and of the family of the Messenger of Allah. He enjoys the prestigious oppurtunity that Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, is happy with him. He is of the offspring of ‘Abd al-Manaf. He possesses (a body of) increasing knowledge. He is perfect in forbearance, the only one to qualify for the position of Imamate. He has full knowledge of the politics, whose obedience is obligatory by the command of Allah. Obedience to him is obligatory by the command of Allah. He is appointed for Imamate by the command of Allah the Most Holy, the Most High to give good advice to the servants of Allah and to protect the religion of Allah. Allah grants success and support to the prophets and the Imams (a.s.) through His treasured knowledge and command in a way that is granted to no one else. Thus, their knowledge is above the knowledge of the people of their times as mentioned in the following words of Allah: 'Is the one who guides to the Truth a proper guide or one who himself cannot find guidance unless he is guided (by others)? What is wrong with you that you judge (so unjustly)?' (Quran 10:35) and in His words, 'Whoever is given wisdom, certainly, has received much good...' (Quran 2:269). Or as about Talut in the following words, 'God has chosen him as your ruler and has given him physical power and knowledge. God grants His authority to anyone whom He wants. God is Provident and All-knowing.' (Quran 2:247) or as He has said about His Prophet (s.w), 'God has revealed the Book to you, has given you wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. Certainly God’s favor to you has been great.' (Quran 4:113) \u003Cbr\u003E He also said about the Imams from the family of the Holy Prophet (s.w) 'Are they jealous of the favors that God has done to some people? We have given to the family of Abraham the Book, Wisdom, and a great Kingdom (Quran 4:54). Certain people have believed, others have disbelieved and tried to prevent people from believing. For these people, only the intense fire of hell is a sufficient punishment.' (Quran 4:55) When Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, chooses a person for the affairs of His servants, He opens his heart for the task, places in it the fountains of wisdom and inspires him with knowledge. He then never becomes tired of answering questions and never becomes confused to miss the right answer. He is infallible, Divinely supported, successful and guarded. He is immune from sins and shortcomings and faults. Allah has granted him this exclusively so that he would serve as the Divine authority over His servants, as a witness over them and this is grace of Allah that He grant to whoever He wills and Allah’s grace is the greatest. Can one among the people have such things so they would choose him as the Imam or can their selected person have such distinctions to be preferred over the others? They, swearing to the house of Allah, have transgressed against the truth and have thrown the book of Allah behind their backs as if they do not know. \u003Cbr\u003E In the book of Allah there is guidance and cure but they have ignored it and have followed their own desires. For this reason Allah has criticized, expressed anger and condemned them in His words as follows: 'Who strays more than one who follows his desires without guidance from God? God does not guide the unjust people.' (Quran 28:50). 'The fate of the unbelievers will be to stumble and their deeds will have no virtuous results.' (Quran 47:8) 'This act greatly angers God and the believers. Thus does God seal the hearts of every arrogant oppressor.'\" (Quran 40:35) May Allah grant blessings up on Prophet Muhammad and his family and may He grant them peace, a great deal of peace.",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "1. Abu Muhammad al-Qasim ibn al-’Ala’, may Allah grant him blessings, in a marfu‘ manner (rafa’aاu), has narrated the following from ‘Abd al-’Aziz ibn Muslim: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "“We had been with al-Rida (a.s.) at Merv. During an assembly in the central mosque on Friday, we attended the gathering. It was when we had just arrived (in Merv). People spoke and discussed about the issue of Imamate (Leadership with Divine Authority). All the differing opinions among people in this matter came up. \u003Cbr\u003E I then went to see my master, (Imam Rida (a.s.)) and informed him of the people’s disagreements over the issue (leadership). The Imam (a.s.) smiled and then said the following: “O ’Abd al-’Aziz (Ibn Muslim), people are ignorant and their opinions have mislead and deceived them. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, did not cause His Holy Prophet to leave this world before completing for him the religion. Allah sent him the Holy Quran in which all things are clearly explained. Allah has explained in the Holy Quran what is lawful and what is unlawful. He has explained totally the limits and the rules for all issues that people may face in the affairs of life. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has said, 'We have left nothing without a mention of it in the Book...' (Quran 6:38) \u003Cbr\u003E During the last visit of the Holy Prophet to Mecca for pilgrimage towards the end of his life the following verse of the Holy Quran was sent to him: 'On this day I have perfected your religion, completed My favors to you, and have chosen Islam as your religion...' (Quran 5:3) The issue of Imamate (leadership) is part of the completion of religion. The Holy Prophet (s.a.) did not leave this world before explaining to his followers the principles of their religion and show them the path clearly, and he left them on a point of a path that faced the direction of the truth. \u003Cbr\u003E He raised Ali (a.s.) among them as a flag and Imam (a leader). He did not leave anything that his followers needed without full explanation. Those who think that Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has not completed His religion, they rejected the book of Allah and those who reject the book of Allah they have become unbelievers in it. Do they know the value and the status of the Imamate of the ’Umma (the nation) to find out if their selecting an Imam is justifiable and permissible? Imamate in fact, is the most sublime in values, greatest in position, highest in status and the most exclusive issue in all aspects. It is the most profound issue and much more meaningful than the extent of the intellect of the people to reach. It is beyond the grasp of their opinions to appoint an Imam or select him. \u003Cbr\u003E Imamate is that particular distinction which Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has distinguished Ibrahim, the very close friend (al-Khalil), after Prophethood. This close friendship is the third stage (in the progression of spiritual degrees). It is a virtue with which, He honored him and established his fame. He then said, 'Behold! I have made you an Imam for the people.' Ibrahim, the close friend, then out of delight pleaded 'Please let it (Imamate) be in my offspring also.' Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, said, 'My covenant does not go to the unjust ones.' (Quran 2:124) Thus, this verse has declared the leadership (Imamate) of all the unjust ones as unlawful till the Day of Judgment and it has established it for those clean and free of evil and injustice. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, bestowed him more honors in establishing Imamate in purified and clean persons of his offspring. Allah has said 'We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a gift and helped both of them to become righteous people (Quran 21:72). We appointed them as leaders to guide the people through Our command and sent them revelation to strive for good deeds, worship their Lord, and pay religious tax. Both of them were Our worshipping servants.” (21:73) \u003Cbr\u003E So the Imamate remained in his offspring inheriting it from each other, generation after generation, until Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, made Prophet Muhammad (s.w) to inherit it. And He, Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, said, 'The nearest people to Abraham, among mankind, are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad) and the true believers. God is the Guardian of the true believers.' (Quran 3:68) So the Imamate belonged to him particularly, and he (s.w), then, entrusted Imam Ali (a.s.) with it by the command of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, as He had made it obligatory. It then came to be in his (Ali’s) purified and clean of sins offspring, to whom Allah has given knowledge and faith, as in the words of He Who is Most High. “Those who have received knowledge and have faith will say, 'By the decree of God, you have remained for the exact period which was mentioned in the Book of God about the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not know.' (Quran 30:56) Imamate will remain in the sons of Imam Ali (a.s.) exclusively, till the Day of Judgment and there will no prophet after Muhammad (s.w). \u003Cbr\u003E Where from then, have these ignorant people received the right to select Imams? Imamate is, certainly, the position of the prophets, and the inheritance of the successors. Imamate indeed, is the representation (Khilafa) of Allah and the deputy of the Messenger (s.w), and the office of Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.) and the inheritance of Imam al-Hasan and al-Husayn (a.s.). Verily, Imamate is the reins of the religion, the system of the Muslims, the rectification of the world, and the honor of the believers. Indeed, Imamate is the foundation of vibrant Islam, and its noble branch. Through the Imam, the prayer, alms, fasting, pilgrimage, jihad, providing for the needy, charity, upholding boundaries and laws, and safeguarding frontiers and borders are ensured. \u003Cbr\u003E The Imam declares as lawful what Allah has done so and prohibits what Allah has prohibited. He enforces the criminal laws of Allah, defends the religion of Allah and he provides guidance with wisdom, good advice and with the topmost strong evidence. The Imam is like the risen sun that beautifies the world with its light and is in the horizon above the harm of hands and eyes. The Imam is as the bright moon, the shining lamp, the brilliant light, and the guiding star in the depth of darkness, in the middle of the towns, in the wilderness and the high seas. The Imam is as crystal-clear water to thirst, an indicator of true guidance and the protector against destruction. The Imam is as fire of a lighthouse that provides warmth and guidance for those who seek heat protection against fatalities. Whoever would depart him would perish. The Imam (in terms of blessings) is as the rain-bearing cloud, the drenching rainfall, the shining sun, the shadow providing sky, the open fields, the gushing forth spring, as a pond and a garden. The Imam is as a comforting friend, a very kind father, a real brother, a tender-hearted mother of a small child, a refuge for people in disastrous conditions. The Imam is Allah’s trustee over His creatures, His authority over His servants, His representative in His lands, the preacher of His cause and the defender of His sanctuary. The Imam is clean of sins, free of faults, possesses special knowledge and is distinguished in forbearance. The Imam maintains law and order in religion. He is the might of the Muslims that enrages the hypocrites, and exterminates the unbelievers. The Imam is the peerless person of his time, no-one can reach even near his rank in virtue and no scholar is comparable to him. No one can become A number of our people has narrated from alternative for him, nor is there anyone similar to him or just like him. His is exclusive in all virtues of which none is acquired or is sought after, in fact, his virtues are all from bestowed up on him by the source of all virtue, the Generous One (Allah). \u003Cbr\u003E Who is he that can know all about the Imam, or can select him? To affirm the ability of selection is very far from the truth. (In the task of recognizing the Imam) Intellects have become confused, understanding has lost the meaning, awareness is frustrated, eyes have become dull and tired, the great ones have become humble, the sagacious ones have become bewildered and people of forbearance have lost patience. (In the task of recognizing the Imam) The orators have become speechless, the intelligent ones have become ignorant and the poets have become exhausted. The men-of-letter have become helpless, people of eloquence have turned wordless to speak of any of the aspects of his status or a virtue of his virtues and instead have confessed their helplessness in the matter. How can one speak of him in full, or describe him in the real sense or understand anything of his affairs or find an alternative for him sufficient for what he sufficed. There is no such thing and nowhere such is found. He is like a star away from the reach of those who try to reach, or those who try to describe. \u003Cbr\u003E Where does the idea of selecting him would then stand in such case? How can then reasons and intellects reach him and where can one find a person like the Imam? “Would they think that such a person can be found outside the family of the Holy Prophet (s.w)? Their souls, I swear by Allah, have told them a lie. Falsehood has induced in them evil hopes. Be on your guard against an uphill and crushing battle in which they would slip back to their first foothold. They intend to raise the Imam by their confused, fruitless and faulty intellects and their misleading opinions. It would do to nothing good for them. Instead it will take them away from the truth , as Allah has said 'May Allah be their adversary. Where are they headed?' (Quran 9:30) They have aimed at a difficult task and have spoken something meaningless. They have strayed far away from the truth and have faced huge confusions. They have knowingly ignored the Imam (a.s.). It is just as Allah has said: 'Satan has made their deeds to seem attractive to them and has blocked them from reaching the path (of guidance) when they know it fully.' (Quran 29:38) They have turned from the choice that Allah and His Messenger and his family made for them, due to their own choice. The Holy Quran calls up on them, 'Your Lord creates and chooses (to grant mercy) to whomever He wants. (In matters of guidance) they (unbelievers) do not have the choice to choose whatever they want. God is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else.' (Quran 28:68) It also says, “The believing men and women must not feel free to do something in their affairs other than that which has been already decided for them by God and His Messenger. One who disobeys God and His Messenger is in plain error. (Quran 33:36) It further says, “What is the matter with you? How could you judge this to be so? (Quran 68:36). Do you have a book from which you study (Quran 68:37) that tells you to do whatever you want? (Quran 68:38). Do you have a covenant with Us which allows you to do whatever you want until the Day of Judgment? (Quran 68:39). (Muhammad), ask which of them can guarantee that on the Day of Judgment (68:40) they will receive the same thing that the Muslims will? Do they have any witness to such an agreement? Let them bring out such witness, if they are truthful.' (Quran 68:41). Allah says 'Is it that they do not think about the Quran or are their hearts sealed?' (Quran 47:24) Or as it says, '…their hearts were sealed and they were left with no understanding.' (Quran 9:87) or like, 'Do not be like those who said that they have heard (the Messenger’s commands) but do not pay any attention to them (Quran 8:21). The most wicked beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb who have no understanding (Quran 8:22). Had they possessed any virtue, God would certainly have made them hear. Even if God were to make them hear, they would still turn away from (the words of God).' (Quran 8:23) or 'You said that you had listened but you disobeyed.' (Quran 2:93) It is the grace from Allah and He gives to whoever He wills. Allah is possesses great generosity. (Quran 57:21) How would they have the right to choose the Imam (a.s.)? \u003Cbr\u003E The Imam (a.s.) is a scholar that is not ignorant of any thing, a shepherd who does not step back from his duty. He is the source of holiness, of purity, noble tradition (the force) of restraint from sins, knowledge and worship. He (enjoys) the blessings of the exclusive prayers of the Messenger of Allah and of being of the progeny of the Holy Lady, al-Batul (Fatima (a.s.)). There is no question about his genealogical purity. He is of the house of Quraysh and the foremost in the clan of Hashim and of the family of the Messenger of Allah. He enjoys the prestigious oppurtunity that Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, is happy with him. He is of the offspring of ‘Abd al-Manaf. He possesses (a body of) increasing knowledge. He is perfect in forbearance, the only one to qualify for the position of Imamate. He has full knowledge of the politics, whose obedience is obligatory by the command of Allah. Obedience to him is obligatory by the command of Allah. He is appointed for Imamate by the command of Allah the Most Holy, the Most High to give good advice to the servants of Allah and to protect the religion of Allah. Allah grants success and support to the prophets and the Imams (a.s.) through His treasured knowledge and command in a way that is granted to no one else. Thus, their knowledge is above the knowledge of the people of their times as mentioned in the following words of Allah: 'Is the one who guides to the Truth a proper guide or one who himself cannot find guidance unless he is guided (by others)? What is wrong with you that you judge (so unjustly)?' (Quran 10:35) and in His words, 'Whoever is given wisdom, certainly, has received much good...' (Quran 2:269). Or as about Talut in the following words, 'God has chosen him as your ruler and has given him physical power and knowledge. God grants His authority to anyone whom He wants. God is Provident and All-knowing.' (Quran 2:247) or as He has said about His Prophet (s.w), 'God has revealed the Book to you, has given you wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. Certainly God’s favor to you has been great.' (Quran 4:113) \u003Cbr\u003E He also said about the Imams from the family of the Holy Prophet (s.w) 'Are they jealous of the favors that God has done to some people? We have given to the family of Abraham the Book, Wisdom, and a great Kingdom (Quran 4:54). Certain people have believed, others have disbelieved and tried to prevent people from believing. For these people, only the intense fire of hell is a sufficient punishment.' (Quran 4:55) When Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, chooses a person for the affairs of His servants, He opens his heart for the task, places in it the fountains of wisdom and inspires him with knowledge. He then never becomes tired of answering questions and never becomes confused to miss the right answer. He is infallible, Divinely supported, successful and guarded. He is immune from sins and shortcomings and faults. Allah has granted him this exclusively so that he would serve as the Divine authority over His servants, as a witness over them and this is grace of Allah that He grant to whoever He wills and Allah’s grace is the greatest. Can one among the people have such things so they would choose him as the Imam or can their selected person have such distinctions to be preferred over the others? They, swearing to the house of Allah, have transgressed against the truth and have thrown the book of Allah behind their backs as if they do not know. \u003Cbr\u003E In the book of Allah there is guidance and cure but they have ignored it and have followed their own desires. For this reason Allah has criticized, expressed anger and condemned them in His words as follows: 'Who strays more than one who follows his desires without guidance from God? God does not guide the unjust people.' (Quran 28:50). 'The fate of the unbelievers will be to stumble and their deeds will have no virtuous results.' (Quran 47:8) 'This act greatly angers God and the believers. Thus does God seal the hearts of every arrogant oppressor.'\" (Quran 40:35) May Allah grant blessings up on Prophet Muhammad and his family and may He grant them peace, a great deal of peace.",

The people were astonished by the beautiful words with which he praised Allah, Exalted be His Majesty. Abu Ishaq said: I asked Harith, “Did you not memorize it?” He answered, “I wrote it down.” So he dictated it to us from his script: \u003Cbr\u003EAll praise belongs to Allah who does not die, and Whose wonders shall never come to an end. He exercises His (Universal) Power everyday, creating things that did not exist before; Who does not beget any who could claim to share in His Glory and Might; and Who is not begotten to die so that He could leave an heir behind. He is beyond all imagination; hence, He cannot be regarded as a visible shape. He is too far beyond the reach of sight to leave any mental impression of Him. His Beginning has no beginning, and His End has no end. Time does not outlast Him. Excess and loss cannot affect Him. He cannot be described in terms of when, what and where. He is Hidden among the hidden. He is Manifest in the mind through His Signs, and through His Wisdom in His Creation. \u003Cbr\u003EWhen questioned about Him, the prophets did not describe Him in terms of any limit, scope, extent or in terms of constituents. Rather, they described Him in terms of His Functions, and they led people towards Him through His Signs. The minds of the intellectuals do not dare deny His Existence. There can be no denying the Might of the Creator of the heavens and the Earth, and all that is between them. He is totally distinct from His Creation. Nothing resembles Him. He brought His Creation into existence so that He would be obeyed and worshipped. He gave human beings the strength to serve Him, and he rebutted their excuses through the best of arguments. Thus, whoever meets his doom does so knowingly and justifiably. It is through His Grace that redemption is secured by the redeemed, and it is Allah’s Grace that prevails in this life and the life to come. \u003Cbr\u003EThen, Allah, to Whom all praise is due, inaugurated the function of this worldly life with His Own Praise, and wound up the function of this worldly life, and the next life, with His Own Praise. As He Himself says: And judgment shall be given between them with justice, and it shall be said: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. All praise is due to Allah Who, despite having no body, has adorned Himself with the Robes of Greatness and Grandeur, and has covered Himself with the Mantle of Awe and Reverence, without having any corporal form. He occupies the Celestial Throne unceasingly. He is far above His Creation, without being far, and without being in mutual contact with them. Neither has He any limit which may end in any limit, nor is there anything like Him through which He can be recognized. Whoever claims to be holy, except Him, is bound to be humiliated. Whoever magnifies himself is bound to be humbled. All things bow before His Greatness and are obedient to His Lordship and Might. \u003Cbr\u003EThe function of the eyes becomes tired in searching for Him. The imagination is unable to reach His Attributes. He existed before any beginning, and nothing preceded Him. He is the Last of All, and there is no last for Him at all. With His Might He holds sway over all things. He observes all places without making any movement. No touch can ever touch Him nor can any sense ever sense Him. And He it is Who is Allah in Heavens and Allah in the Earth; and He is the Wise, the knowing. Whatever He intended to create He planned for it soundly and correctly without there being any example of it before, and without being tired thereby (in creating whatever He wanted to create). He started whatever He needed to start, and made whatever He wanted to make. He intended to create two weights, the jinn and humankind, so that they should recognize His Lordship on the basis of all these means (of revealed wisdom in His Creation referred to above), and be able to obey Him (consciously). \u003Cbr\u003EWe glorify Allah with all words of praise for the bounties He has bestowed. And we seek guidance from Him in our righteous affairs. Furthermore, we seek refuge from Him against our misdeeds. We solicit His Forgiveness for our past sins. We bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad (sw) in His Servant and Messenger whom Allah raised with truth, who leads to Allah, and who guides towards Him. Thus, He rescued us from misguidance through him, guiding us to the right path, and through him freed us from ignorance. Hence, whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he indeed achieves a mighty success, and has secured divine blessings in abundance.

    "englishText": "1. My father, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Sa`d ibn `Abd Allah on the authority of Ya`qub ibn Yazid on the authority of al-`Abbas ibn Hilal that I asked al-Rida (AS) about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: “Allah is the Light of the Heavens and the Earth.” So he replied (AS): “He is the Guide of the Inhabitants of Heaven and the Guide of the Inhabitants of the Earth.” While the narration of al-Barqi states: “He guides whatever is in the Heavens, and He guides whatever is in the Earth.” The Compiler of this book says: The anthropomorphist interpret this verse as He is the Light of the Heavens and the Earth. If that were correct, how is it possible to find darkness on the Earth at any time, be it day or night? If Allah was the Light of the Heavens, and the Earth, according to their interpretation, He would have to be perpetually present, and could not be non-existent at times. Therefore, when we find the Earth dark at night, and when we find the inside of the Earth dark (even) during the day, then this indicates that the interpretation of : “Allah is the Light of heaves, and the Earth,” is what al-Rida (AS) has said and not that the anthropomorphist have given. So, verily, He, the Mighty and High, is the Guide of the Inhabitants in the Heavens and the Earth, and the Indicator [Mubayyin] for the Inhabitants of the Heavens and the Earth in their religious and worldly affairs. In the same way that the inhabitants of the Heavens and the Earth are guided by Allah in their religious affairs, they are guided by the Light that Allah has created for them in the Heavens and the Earth in their worldly affairs. This is what He meant when He said that He was the Light of the Heaves and the Earth. The attribute He applied to Himself is metaphorical since, intellectually – speaking, it is not logical for Allah, the Mighty and High, to be light or to glow, or to belong to the realm of lights, for the simple fact that He is the Creator of Light. His Statement also applies to the verse: “A likeness of His Light.” Verily, He intended by it the description of His Light. Evidently, this Light is other than Him since He anthropomorphized it with the lamp and its glow, as He mentioned and described in this verse. It is not permissible to anthropomorphize His Being with the lamp, because there is no likeness and no equivalent to Allah. Therefore, it is correct to say that His Light, which He anthropomorphized with a lamp, refers to His Guidance. It refers to the fact that He guides the inhabitants of the Heaves and the Earth towards His Religion, towards divine Unity, toward His Wisdom, and towards His Justice. After explaining the Clearness of His Guidance and naming it “Light,” as He guides with it His Servants to His Religion and what is in their best interests, He said: A likeness of it is a niche in which is a lamp, the lamp is in a clear glass that resembles a brightly shining star in its clearness. The brightly shining star is a star that resembles a pearl in its color. This lamp, which is in a clear glass, light from a blessed olive oil. He has intended by this Syrian oil, because it is said: It is blessed for its inhabitants. By “Neither eastern nor western,” the Mighty and High means that this oil is neither eastern, so that he sun does not shine on it at the time of sunset, nor western so that the sun does not shine on it at the time of sunrise. Rather, it is from the upper part of the tree and the sun shines on it throughout the day. This is what makes it the best, and makes its oil light. He then emphasized the clearness of its oil; that “the oil whereof almost gives light through fire touches it not” to describe its clarity. He explains that the religious guidance that Allah gives His Servants in the Heavens and the Earth, is clear, and its explanation, which is the clear glass, is equally clear. The fire ignites the clear oil as He described. The glow of the fire combines with the glow of glass and the glow of oil in it. This is the meaning of His Word: “light upon light,” and this is what He, the Mighty and High, meant: “Allah guides to His light whom He pleases.” That is, from His Servants who have reached the age of maturity so that they may recognize by that and be guided through it, and reason with it, regarding the unity of their Lord, and all religious matters. Allah, the Mighty and High, has indicated by this verse what He has mentioned of His Clear Indications and Signs with which He guides His Servants in their religion. In other words, none of them have been left in ignorance. If any of them neglect their religion, it is not due to vagueness or ambiguity on behalf of Allah, the Mighty and High, since Allah, the Mighty and High, has explained to them His Indications and Signs.

    "arabicText": "1 - حدثنا أبي رضي الله عنه، قال: حدثنا سعد بن عبد الله، عن يعقوب بن يزيد، عن العباس بن هلال، قال: سألت الرضا عليه السلام عن قول الله عز وجل: (الله نور السماوات والأرض) فقال: هاد لأهل السماء وهاد لأهل الأرض. وفي رواية البرقي: هدى من في السماوات وهدى من في الأرض. قال مصنف هذا الكتاب: إن المشبهة تفسر هذه الآية على أنه ضياء السماوات والأرض، ولو كان كذلك لما جاز أن توجد الأرض مظلمة في وقت من الأوقات لا بالليل ولا بالنهار  لأن الله هو نورها وضياؤها على تأويلهم وهو موجود غير معدوم، فوجودنا الأرض مظلمة بالليل  ووجودنا داخلها أيضا مظلما بالنهار يدل على أن تأويل قوله: (الله نور السماوات والأرض) هو ما قاله الرضا عليه السلام دون تأويله المشبهة، فإنه عز وجل هاد لأهل السماوات والأرض، المبين لأهل السماوات والأرض أمور دينهم ومصالحهم، فلما كان بالله وبهداه يهتدي أهل السماوات والأرض إلى صلاحهم وأمور دينهم كما يهتدون بالنور الذي خلق الله لهم في السماوات والأرض إلى صلاح دنياهم قال: إنه نور السماوات والأرض على هذا المعنى، وأجرى على نفسه هذا الاسم توسعا ومجازا، لأن العقول دالة على أن الله عز وجل لا يجوز أن يكون نورا ولا ضياء ولا من جنس الأنوار والضياء، لأنه خالق الأنوار وخالق جميع أجناس الأشياء، وقد دل على ذلك أيضا قوله: (مثل نوره) وإنما أراد به صفة نوره، وهذا النور هو غيره، لأنه شبهه بالمصباح وضوئه الذي ذكره ووصفه في هذه الآية، ولا يجوز أن يشبه نفسه بالمصباح، لأن الله لا شبه له ولا نظير، فصح أن نوره الذي شبهه بالمصباح إنما هو دلالته أهل السماوات و الأرض على مصالح دينهم وعلى توحيد ربهم وحكمته وعدله، ثم بين وضوح دلالته هذه وسماها نورا من حيث يهتدي بها عبادة إلى دينهم وصلاحهم، فقال: مثله كمثل كوة وهي المشكاة فيها المصباح والمصباح هو السراج في زجاجة صافية شبيهة بالكوكب الدري في صفائه، والكوكب الدري، هو الكوكب المشبه بالدر في لونه، وهذا المصباح الذي في هذه الزجاجة الصافية يتوقد من زيت زيتونة مباركة، وأراد به زيتون الشام لأنه يقال: إنه بورك فيه لأهله وعنى عز وجل بقوله: (لا شرقية ولا غربية) أن هذه الزيتونة ليست بشرقية فلا تسقط الشمس عليها في وقت الغروب، ولا غربية فلا تسقط الشمس عليها في وقت الطلوع، بل هي في أعلى شجرها والشمس تسقط عليها في طول نهارها فهو أجود لها وأضوء لزيتها، ثم أكد وصفه لصفاء زيتها فقال: (يكاد زيتها يضئ ولو لم تمسسه نار) لما فيها من الصفاء فبين أن دلالات الله التي بها دل عباده في السماوات والأرض على مصالحهم وعلى أمور دينهم هي في الوضوح والبيان بمنزلة هذا المصباح الذي في هذه الزجاجة الصافية ويتوقد بها الزيت الصافي الذي وصفه، فيجتمع فيه ضوء النار مع ضوء الزجاجة وضوء الزيت وهو معنى قوله: (نور على نور) وعنى بقوله عز وجل: (يهدي الله لنوره من يشاء) يعني من عباده وهم المكلفون ليعرفوا بذلك ويهتدوا به ويستدلوا به على توحيد ربهم وسائر أمور دينهم، وقد دل الله عز وجل بهذه الآية وبما ذكره من وضوح دلالاته وآياته التي دل بها عباده على دينهم أن أحد منهم لم يؤت فيما صار إليه من الجهل ومن تضييع الدين لشبهة ولبس دخلا عليه في ذلك من قبل الله عز وجل، إذ كان الله عز وجل قد بين لهم دلالاته وآياته على سبيل ما وصف، وإنهم إنما أتوا في ذلك من قبل أنفسهم بتركهم النظر في دلالات الله واستدلال بها على الله عز وجل وعلى صلاحهم في دينهم، وبين أنه بكل شئ من مصالح عباده ومن غير ذلك عليم.

    "thaqalaynSanad": "1. My father, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Sa`d ibn `Abd Allah on the authority of Ya`qub ibn Yazid on the authority of al-`Abbas ibn Hilal",
    "thaqalaynMatn": " that I asked al-Rida (AS) about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: “Allah is the Light of the Heavens and the Earth.” So he replied (AS): “He is the Guide of the Inhabitants of Heaven and the Guide of the Inhabitants of the Earth.” While the narration of al-Barqi states: “He guides whatever is in the Heavens, and He guides whatever is in the Earth.” The Compiler of this book says: The anthropomorphist interpret this verse as He is the Light of the Heavens and the Earth. If that were correct, how is it possible to find darkness on the Earth at any time, be it day or night? If Allah was the Light of the Heavens, and the Earth, according to their interpretation, He would have to be perpetually present, and could not be non-existent at times. Therefore, when we find the Earth dark at night, and when we find the inside of the Earth dark (even) during the day, then this indicates that the interpretation of : “Allah is the Light of heaves, and the Earth,” is what al-Rida (AS) has said and not that the anthropomorphist have given. So, verily, He, the Mighty and High, is the Guide of the Inhabitants in the Heavens and the Earth, and the Indicator [Mubayyin] for the Inhabitants of the Heavens and the Earth in their religious and worldly affairs. In the same way that the inhabitants of the Heavens and the Earth are guided by Allah in their religious affairs, they are guided by the Light that Allah has created for them in the Heavens and the Earth in their worldly affairs. This is what He meant when He said that He was the Light of the Heaves and the Earth. The attribute He applied to Himself is metaphorical since, intellectually – speaking, it is not logical for Allah, the Mighty and High, to be light or to glow, or to belong to the realm of lights, for the simple fact that He is the Creator of Light. His Statement also applies to the verse: “A likeness of His Light.” Verily, He intended by it the description of His Light. Evidently, this Light is other than Him since He anthropomorphized it with the lamp and its glow, as He mentioned and described in this verse. It is not permissible to anthropomorphize His Being with the lamp, because there is no likeness and no equivalent to Allah. Therefore, it is correct to say that His Light, which He anthropomorphized with a lamp, refers to His Guidance. It refers to the fact that He guides the inhabitants of the Heaves and the Earth towards His Religion, towards divine Unity, toward His Wisdom, and towards His Justice. After explaining the Clearness of His Guidance and naming it “Light,” as He guides with it His Servants to His Religion and what is in their best interests, He said: A likeness of it is a niche in which is a lamp, the lamp is in a clear glass that resembles a brightly shining star in its clearness. The brightly shining star is a star that resembles a pearl in its color. This lamp, which is in a clear glass, light from a blessed olive oil. He has intended by this Syrian oil, because it is said: It is blessed for its inhabitants. By “Neither eastern nor western,” the Mighty and High means that this oil is neither eastern, so that he sun does not shine on it at the time of sunset, nor western so that the sun does not shine on it at the time of sunrise. Rather, it is from the upper part of the tree and the sun shines on it throughout the day. This is what makes it the best, and makes its oil light. He then emphasized the clearness of its oil; that “the oil whereof almost gives light through fire touches it not” to describe its clarity. He explains that the religious guidance that Allah gives His Servants in the Heavens and the Earth, is clear, and its explanation, which is the clear glass, is equally clear. The fire ignites the clear oil as He described. The glow of the fire combines with the glow of glass and the glow of oil in it. This is the meaning of His Word: “light upon light,” and this is what He, the Mighty and High, meant: “Allah guides to His light whom He pleases.” That is, from His Servants who have reached the age of maturity so that they may recognize by that and be guided through it, and reason with it, regarding the unity of their Lord, and all religious matters. Allah, the Mighty and High, has indicated by this verse what He has mentioned of His Clear Indications and Signs with which He guides His Servants in their religion. In other words, none of them have been left in ignorance. If any of them neglect their religion, it is not due to vagueness or ambiguity on behalf of Allah, the Mighty and High, since Allah, the Mighty and High, has explained to them His Indications and Signs. Verily, they come to make mistake, due to forgetting about Allah’s sings and failing to derive through these signs the existence of Allah, the Mighty and High, and what is in their best religious interest. He has also explained that He Is All-Knowing when it comes to the interest of His Servants.",

Then the Honorable the Exalted God ordered it to go back and it did. Then God ordered it to come forward, and it did. Then God ordered it to talk. It said, “Praise be to God, who has no one to oppose Him, no one to equal Him, no one to be like Him and no one to match Him - the One to whom everything is humble, and everything is in humility”. God then said, “I swear by My Majesty and Honor and I have not created any creatures better, nobler, dearer, or more obedient than you. I am recognized to be the only One to be worshipped by you. I am called by you. I am the place for the people to turn to for hope due to you. The people will fear Me and are cautious due to you. Reward and punishment is given by you.”The intellect was proud of hearing these words and fell prostrate in worship. This prostration in worship lasted one-thousand years. Then the Blessed the Sublime God said, “Now raise your head and ask Me to grant you something, and that your intercession to be accepted by Me.” Then the intellect raised its head and said, “I ask You to accept my intercession on behalf of anyone who is intelligent.”God - may His Majesty be Exalted - told the angels, “Bear witness that I have accepted its intercession on behalf of anyone to whom I grant intelligence.”",

    "thaqalaynMatn": "“The Honorable the Exalted God created the intellect from light which was hidden in His treasure of Knowledge from before; and none of the appointed Prophets or nearby-stationed angels had any access to that treasure. God then established knowledge as its life, understanding as its soul, abstinence as its head, shame as its eyes, wisdom as its tongue, kindness as its concern, and mercy as its heart. Then he strengthened it with certitude, faith, honesty, tranquility, sincerity, kindness, generosity, contentment, submission and perseverance. Then the Honorable the Exalted God ordered it to go back and it did. Then God ordered it to come forward, and it did. Then God ordered it to talk. It said, “Praise be to God, who has no one to oppose Him, no one to equal Him, no one to be like Him and no one to match Him - the One to whom everything is humble, and everything is in humility”. God then said, “I swear by My Majesty and Honor and I have not created any creatures better, nobler, dearer, or more obedient than you. I am recognized to be the only One to be worshipped by you. I am called by you. I am the place for the people to turn to for hope due to you. The people will fear Me and are cautious due to you. Reward and punishment is given by you.”The intellect was proud of hearing these words and fell prostrate in worship. This prostration in worship lasted one-thousand years. Then the Blessed the Sublime God said, “Now raise your head and ask Me to grant you something, and that your intercession to be accepted by Me.” Then the intellect raised its head and said, “I ask You to accept my intercession on behalf of anyone who is intelligent.”God - may His Majesty be Exalted - told the angels, “Bear witness that I have accepted its intercession on behalf of anyone to whom I grant intelligence.”",

For I have certainly asked about it from many scholars. They have not been able to answer me with a satisfactory answer.” So I said: “Would you like to tell me the query. Perhaps I have an answer that would please you.” He replied, “I would certainly like to meet Abu `Abd Allah (AS) with this query.” So I obtained the permission for him and he entered his presence and asked him (AS), “Do you permit me to ask a question?” The Imam (AS) replied, “Ask what has come to you.” He asked, “How can you prove that you have a Creator?” Consequently, he (AS) responded, I found myself not free from one of two possibilities: either I have crated myself, or someone else has created me. If I have created myself, then I am not free from one of the two meanings: either I created myself while I was already existent, or I created myself while I was on nonexistent. Hence, if I created myself, and I already exited, then I was self-sufficient of giving existence to myself. And if I was nonexistent, then you know that the nonexistent cannot bring about a thing. Therefore, the third meaning is proved that I have a Creator and that is Allah, the Lord of the Universe. Al-Daysani got up and did not negate the answer. The Compiler of this book says: The correct statement in this chapter is to say: we have recognized Allah through Allah, because if we recognized Him through our intellects then He, the Mighty and High, is the Bestower of our intellects. And if we recognized Him, the Mighty and High, through His Prophets, Messengers and Proofs (AS) then He, the Mighty and High, is the One that delegates them, sends them, and the One who has taken them as His Proofs. If we have recognized Him though ourselves then He, the Mighty and High, is the One who brought us about. Thus, through Him we have recognized Him. Al-Sadiq (AS) has said: “If Allah did not exist then we (Imams) would not have been known, and if we were not there, then Allah would not be recognized.” The meaning of that is that if the Proofs did not exist, then Allah would not be recognized the way He deserves to be recognized, and if Allah did not exist, then the Proofs would not have been known. I have heard some theologians say: “Even if a person were born in a desert on earth and even if he found nobody to guide him until he becomes big, contemplating the heaves and the earth would be sufficient to guide him to the fact that there is One Creator who brought them about.” I would respond: Verily, this is something that has not happened, and it relates the news of something that has not happened. If it has happened, how could it be? If such a thing ever took place, then that man must have been a Proof of Allah, may His Remembrance of Himself be Exalted, or a Prophet (AS). Allah sent different type of Prophets. Some were individual Prophets, who were individually guided. Some were sent to their families, and children. Some were sent to the people in their region. Some were sent to the people in their city. And some were sent to all of humanity. As for the reasoning of Ibrahim (AS), the Friend of Allah, when he looked at Venus, the Moon, and the Sun, when they set he said: O people! Verily, I am free from the partners you ascribe to Allah. He (AS) was a Prophet who had inspiration, was delegate and sent by Allah. All of his words were through the inspiration of Allah, the Mighty and High. As we see in the Word of the Mighty and High: This is Our argument which We gave to Abraham rebutting his people. People are not all like Ibrahim (AS). If it were sufficient to simply think about Allah without the guidance and Direction of Allah, the Mighty and High, then why did Allah, the Mighty and High, reveal what He revealed of His Word: So know that there is no god but Allah, and His Word: Say: He Allah is One, and His Word: Wonderful Originator of heavens and the earth! How could He have a son when He has no consort and He is the Knower of subtleties, the Aware. Also the last verse of the chapter “The Banishment,” and other verses about Divine Unity.",
    "arabicText": "10 - حدثنا علي بن أحمد بن محمد بن عمران الدقاق رحمه الله، قال: حدثنا محمد بن جعفر أبو الحسين الأسدي، قال: حدثنا الحسين بن المأمون القرشي  عن عمر بن عبد العزيز، عن هشام بن الحكم، قال: قال لي أبو شاكر الديصاني: إن لي مسألة تستأذن لي على صاحبك، فإني قد سألت عنها جماعة من العلماء فما أجابوني بجواب مشبع، فقلت: هل لك أن تخبرني بها فلعل عندي جوابا ترتضيه فقال: إني أحب أن ألقى بها أبا عبد الله عليه السلام، فاستأذنت له فدخل فقال له: أتأذن لي في السؤال؟ فقال له: سل عما بدا لك، فقال له: ما الدليل على أن لك صانعا؟ فقال: وجدت نفسي لا تخلو من إحدى جهتين: إما أن أكون صنعتها أنا أو صنعها غيري، فإن كنت صنعتها أنا فلا أخلو من أحد معنيين: إما أن أكون صنعتها و كانت موجودة، أو صنعتها وكانت معدومة، فإن كنت صنعتها وكانت موجودة فقد استغنت بوجودها عن صنعتها، وإن كانت معدومة فإنك تعلم أن المعدوم لا يحدث شيئا فقد ثبت المعنى الثالث أن لي صانعا وهو الله رب العالمين فقام وما أحار جوابا. قال مصنف هذا الكتاب: القول الصواب في هذا الباب هو أن يقال: عرفنا الله بالله لأنا إن عرفناه بعقولنا فهو عز وجل واهبها، وإن عرفناه عز وجل بأنبيائه ورسله وحججه عليهم السلام فهو عز وجل باعثهم ومرسلهم ومتخذهم حججا، وإن عرفناه بأنفسنا فهو عز وجل محدثها، فبه عرفناه، وقد قال الصادق عليه السلام: (لولا الله ما عرفنا  ولولا نحن ما عرف الله) ومعناه لولا الحجج ما عرف الله حق معرفته، ولولا الله ما عرف الحجج، وقد سمعت بعض أهل الكلام يقول: لو أن رجلا ولد في فلاة من الأرض ولم ير أحدا يهديه ويرشده حتى كبر وعقل ونظر إلى السماء والأرض لدله ذلك على أن لهما صانعا ومحدثا، فقلت: إن هذا شئ لم يكن، و هو إخبار بما لم يكن أن لو كان كيف كان يكون، ولو كان ذلك لكان لا يكون ذلك الرجل إلا حجة الله تعالى ذكره على نفسه، كما في الأنبياء عليهم السلام منهم من بعث إلى نفسه، ومنهم من بعث إلى أهله وولده، ومنهم من بعث إلى أهل محلته، ومنهم من بعث إلى أهل بلده، ومنهم من بعث إلى الناس كافة، وأما استدلال إبراهيم الخليل عليه السلام بنظره إلى الزهرة ثم إلى القمر ثم إلى الشمس، وقوله لما أفلت: (يا قوم إني برئ مما تشركون) فإنه عليه السلام كان نبيا ملهما مبعوثا مرسلا وكان جميعا قوله بإلهام الله عز وجل إياه، وذلك قوله عز وجل: ﴿وتلك حجتنا آتيناها إبراهيم على قومه﴾ (١) وليس كل أحد كإبراهيم عليه السلام، ولو استغنى في معرفة التوحيد بالنظر عن تعليم الله عز وجل وتعريفه لما أنزل الله عز وجل ما أنزل من قوله: ﴿فاعلم أنه لا إله إلا الله﴾ (٢) ومن قوله: (قل هو الله أحد - إلى آخرها) ومن قوله: ﴿بديع السماوات والأرض أنى يكون له ولد ولم تكن له صاحبة - إلى قوله - وهو اللطيف الخبير﴾  وآخر الحشر، وغيرها من آيات التوحيد . باب إثبات حدوث العالم ",

    "englishText": "11-50 Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran ad-Daqqaq - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Muhammad ibn Yaqoob al-Kolayni quoted on the authority of Ali ibn Muhammad - known as Al’lan, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of Al-Hussein ibn Khalid that Abil Hassan Al-Ridha (s) said, “May God bestow upon you knowledge of the good! Know that the Blessed the Sublime God is eternal. Eternity is that attribute which guides the wise to know that there was nothing before Him in eternity, nor is there anything eternal along with Him. That this attribute is a miraculous one has come to light from the acknowledgement by the common folks that there is nothing before God, with God or after Him. At the same time, it invalidates the belief that there was something before or along with Him. Had there beensomething eternal along with Him, He would not have been the Creator of that thing. If it was along with Him, how then could He have been its creator? Had there been something existing before Him, then that thing might have been His creator because of its existing earlier than Him.The Blessed the Sublime God has ascribed certain names to Himself. When He created His creatures, He enabled them to worship Him and told His creatures to call Him by those names. He called Himself All-Hearing, All-Seeing, All-Powerful, Guarding, Standing, Manifest, Hidden, Subtle, All-Aware, Powerful, Majestic, Wise, the All-Knowing and other similar names. When the animosity-mongers who speak lies heard us mention such names and that there is nothing similar to Him, and that none of the creatures are like onto Him they began to speak out. They said, “When you say that there is nothing like onto Him and nothing is similar to Him, then how come you also use those beautiful names for yourselves? This is a proof that you are similar to Him in all conditions or in some conditions because of having the same beautiful names.” It is said to them that the Blessed the Sublime God has named His servants with some of His own names but with differences in meaning. A name may have two different meanings. The proof of this is simply what is popular amongst the people. This is the same way that the Honorable the Exalted God has addressed the people. He has spoken to them by means of things that they understand so that they will have no excuse in their misdeeds.A man is sometimes called a dog, a donkey, a bull, a lion, sweet or bitter. All these are used with a meaning different from their true meaning since they are not used in their original meaning. Man is not a lion or a dog. May God have Mercy upon you! Please pay close attention to this.The Honorable the Exalted God is called All-Aware. This does not mean that He has created knowledge. It does not mean that with His knowledge of things He knows things and He uses this knowledge to preserve His future commands and the process of creating what He creates, and destroying what He destroys and without such knowledge He would have been weak and ignorant.We see that people of knowledge among the people are called knowledgeable because of having some created knowledge, which they did not have at some time before. Perhaps such knowledge may go away from them and they become ignorant.God is called All-Knowing because He is not ignorant of anything. Thus, the Creator and the creatures are both called knowing, but the meaning is different as you have noticed.Our Lord is called All-Hearing. However, this it is not through a body part on Him with which He could hear the sound but could not see as is the case with us. We cannot see with the part with which we hear. However, the Honorable the Exalted God has told us that no sound is hidden from Him. His hearing is not limited as it is in our case. Here again the name hearing is used in both cases, but its meaning is different. He is also All-Seeing in the same way. That is He is seeing not through an organ unlike us. We see using a body part with which we cannot do anything else. However, God is All-Seeing but not by looking at any object. Again the same name is used in both cases, but its meaning is different.God is said to be Standing but not in the sense of standing in an upright position on the legs as is the case with other things. When He says that He is Standing it means that He is the Guardian. This is like saying that a man is standing behind our affairs. The Honorable the Exalted God is Standing behind every soul regarding what it gains. As used by people the word standing also has meanings like remaining and sufficing. As you may say to a man, ‘Stand up over the affairs of so and so’ which means deal with them in a sufficient manner. Standing for us means that we stand on our legs. Therefore, the name is similar but its meaning is different.The name al-Latif, meaning ‘the Subtle’ is not in the sense of smallness or being infinitesimal, but it is in the rarity and hard to perceive nature of things. As an example it may be said, ‘It has become very delicate for me and that so and so is very delicate in his manners and dealings.’ This means that it is profound for the intellect and it is very difficult to understand. It has become so delicate that even one’s imagination cannot perceive it. The Blessed the Sublime God is far more Subtle than to be comprehended through definitions or be limited by an attribute in the way we are subtle, small and delicate. Names are the same but different in meaning.The name al-Khabir, meaning ‘All-Aware’, is for One Who knows all things completely but not by means of gaining experience and learningfrom the past as if were it not for this experience he would know nothing. One without any experience and training is an ignorant person. The Sublime God is always All-Aware of what He has created. The people who are well are those people who are learning to overcome their ignorance. Thus names are the same but again, they differ in meaning.The name al-Zahir meaning ‘clear and conspicuous’ is not because of Him being over and on top of all things or sitting on the topmost part of them, but it is because of His Domination and having power over all things. An example of this is when a person says, ‘I overcame my enemies or that God granted me victory over my enemies.’ In this case, there is a report of the failure and victory. Thus this shows God’s Domination over all things.Another example is that His Existence is clear for those who want (to know) Him. Nothing is hidden from Him and He is the guardian of all that can be seen. Whose existence can then be clearer than that of the Sublime God? Wherever you are you will see His creatures. Even within your own self there is enough of His Creation. However, for us our existence is what is apparent and has limits. Therefore the names are the same, but their meaning differs.The name al-Batin, means ‘the Hidden.’ This is not in the sense of being inside of things by means of diving in, or by other means. Rather it is in the sense of His dealing with, having knowledge of, preserving and regulating the internal aspect of all things. As one may say, “I tried to find the inside to learn and discover the secrets.” Hidden for us is what is unseen and covered. In this case again the names are the same but they differ in meaning.The name al-Qahir, means ‘the Subduer.’ It is not in the sense of plotting, using certain devices and speaking attractive words or cunning means as some people subdue each other. The victorious among the people may become subdued and vice versa. For the Blessed the Sublime God all the creatures are weak. Due to the absence of obstacles in what He wills about them, it only takes less than a blinking of the eye to say it Be and it is. ‘We but say the word, ‘Be’, and it is.’  Subduing in our case is how I mentioned and explained. Thus names are alike but their meanings differ. That is the case for all the names, although we have not mentioned all of them. We will suffice with this for learning purposes. May the Honorable the Exalted God be your helper and our helper in the matters of guidance and success.”",

    "translator": "Dr. Ali Peiravi",
    "englishText": "12-1 Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Ahmad al-Ilaqi - the jurisprudent from Qum - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Abu Muhammad Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Sadaqa al-Qumi quoted on the authority of Abu Amro ibn Muhammad ibn Umar ibn Abdul Aziz Al-Ansari al-Kajji, on the authority of Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Nowafali al-Hashemi,When Ali ibn Musa Al-Ridha (s) went to see Al-Ma’mun, Al-Ma’mun ordered Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl to summon the prominent theologians from among the rhetoricians and the religions such as al-Jaseliq (the Catholic Archbishop), the High Rabbi, the Hindu High Priest, followers of Zoroaster, Nestus the Roman medical scientist, and the rest of thetheologians in order to hear their words, and those of Al-Ridha (s). Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl gathered them together (in Al-Ma’mun’s palace), and then he informed Al-Ma’mun about the meeting. Al-Ma’mun granted them permission to enter and received them with hospitality and honor.Then he presented before them what he intended to do by saying, “I have gathered you for (something) good and want you to have a debate with my cousin from Medina, who will come to me. Come to me tomorrow morning. None of you should be absent.”They said, “O Commander of the Faithful! We listen and obey you. God willing, we will be here first thing in the morning.”Al-Nawfali said, “We were talking to Abil Hassan (s) when Yasir - the servant who was in charge of serving Abil Hassan (s) entered and told him, “O my master! Indeed the Commander of the Faithful expressed his greetings to you and said, May your brother be your ransom! Indeed the chief scientists, scholars from all religions and masters of speech from all nations have all gathered together here with me. Would you like to come to us and have a discussion with them? If you do not wish to do so, do not bother yourself. Even if you prefer, we do not mind coming to you. Then Abul Hassan said, “Express my greetings to him and tell him that I understand what you mean. God willing, I will come to you myself tomorrow morning.”Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said, ‘When Yasir went out, the Imam (s) turned to me and said, ‘O Nawfali! You are an Iraqi, and an Iraqi’s heart is not hard. So, what do think is your cousin’s intention in setting up a meeting between me and the pagans and scholars?”Al-Nawfali answered, “May I be your ransom! He wants to test you, and wants to know how much knowledge you possess. He has, indeed, based his assumption on shaky grounds. By God, what he has set up is dangerous.”The Imam (s) asked, “And what has he set up?”Al-Nawfali said, “The theologians and the heretics are different from the scholars. That is because a scholar does not deny the undeniable, whereas rhetoricians, theologians, and polytheists are people who deny things and try to prove what is not true. If you argue with them and tell them that God is One, they would say, ’Prove His Oneness’, and if yousay that Muhammad (s) is the Messenger of God, they would say, ’Prove his Prophethood.’ May I be your ransom! They confuse you and make you disprove your own proofs. They continue these false accusations until you back off.”Al-Nawfali added, “Then the Imam (s) smiled and told me, ‘O Al-Nawfali! Do you fear that they will disprove my argument?’”Al-Nawfali said, ‘No, by God! I have never worried about you, and I hope that God willing, God will make you victorious over them!’The Imam (s) asked again, ‘O Nawfali! Would you like to know when Al-Ma’mun will feel regretful?’ He answered, ‘Yes.’ The Imam (s) said, ‘When he (al-Ma’mun) hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own Torah, with the people of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel, with the people of the Psalms quoting their own Psalms, with the Zoroastrians arguing in their Persian language, with the Romans in their own Latin, and with the rhetoricians using their very own rhetoric. So, if I close the avenues of argument in the face of each arguing party and disprove his claim, making him renounce his statement from its onset and referring to my own statement, then Al-Ma’mun will realize that he has not achieve what he aspires to achieve. It is then that he will feel regretful. And there is no strength save in the Highest, the Almighty God.’”On the following day, Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl went in a hurry to see the Imam (s) and told him, “May I be your ransom! Your cousin is waiting for you. The people have gathered together. When will you go to him?”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “You go ahead. God willing, I will come to you.” Then he (s) made ablutions for praying, drank something, ate some soup with us and we all left. Then we reached Al-Ma’mun’s palace. The meeting was full of people. Muhammad ibn Ja’far, some of the Talibites and the Hashemites, and the Commanders of the Army were amongst those present.When Al-Ridha (s) entered, Al-Ma’mun stood up. Muhammad ibn Ja’far and all the Hashemites who were present there stood up for him. The Imam and Al-Ma’mun sat down while all the people were still standing, until Al-Ma’mun ordered them to sit down. Al-Ma’mun talked to the Imam (s) for a while. Then Al-Ma’mun turned to the CatholicArchbishop and said, “O Catholic Archbishop! This is my cousin Ali ibn Musa ibn Ja’far (s). He is one of the children of (the Blessed Lady) Fatima (s) - the daughter of our Prophet (s) - and Ali ibn Abi Talib (s). I would like you to have a debate with him and be fair with him.The Catholic Archbishop said, “O Commander of the Faithful! How can I argue with a man who argues with me using a Book which we have denied and a Prophet whom I do not believe in?”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “O Christian! Will you accept it if I present proofs from your Gospel?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “How could I reject what the Bible speaks about? I swear to God that I will accept it even if I dislike it.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “Ask whatever you wish to ask and receive your answer.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “What is your opinion about the Prophethood of Jesus (s) and his Book? Do you deny either one of them?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “I admit to the Prophethood of Jesus (s), his Book, and what he advised his nation to do- which his disciples accepted. However, I reject the Prophethood of any Jesus who has not professed the Prophethood of Muhammad, his Book and what he (s) advised his nation to do.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “Aren’t precepts proved through two just witnesses?”The Imam (s) said, “Yes.” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Therefore, name two witnesses other than the people of your own nation and ones whom Christianity does not reject to testify to the Prophethood of Muhammad. Likewise, ask us a similar thing from people other than our own nation.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Christian! Now you are speaking fairly. Do you accept a just person who was given preference (over others) by the Messiah - Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “Who is the just one? Name him for me.”The Imam (s) said, “What is your opinion of John al-Daylami?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “Bravo! Bravo!” You have mentioned the person loved the most by the Messiah.”The Imam (s) said, “Then I ask you to swear to and tell me whether or not the Bible says that John says, ‘The Messiah has informed me of the religion of Muhammad, the Arab, and has given me the glad tidings about him who will be (a Prophet) after him. Therefore, I gave the glad tidings of him to the disciples and they believed in him.’”The Catholic Archbishop said, “John did quote this from the Messiah. He did give the glad tidings of a man who will be a Prophet, his Household and his Trustees. He has not clarified when this will happen and has not named them so that we may know who they are.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “If we bring someone here who can recite the Bible and he recites to you Muhammad’s name, his Household, and his nation, will you believe in him?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “What a sound suggestion!”Al-Ridha (s) turned to Nestus the Roman and asked him, “Have you memorized the third Book of the Bible?”He answered, “I have thoroughly memorized it.” Then the Imam (s) addressed the Catholic Archbishop and said, “Can you recite the Bible?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Yes, of course.”The Imam (s) said, “Then I will recite to you (some verses from) the third Book. If Muhammad (s), his Household, and his nation were mentioned in it, then bear witness! And if they have not been mentioned therein, then do not bear witness.” Then the Imam (s) recited to him some of the verses of the third Book until he (s) reached the reference to the Prophet (s). He stopped reading and said, “O Christian! I challenge you to swear by the Messiah and his mother. Have you realized that I have knowledge of the Bible?” He replied, “Yes.”The Imam recited to him some verses from the third Book concerning the reference to the Prophet, his Household and his community. Then the Imam (s) said, “O Christian! What do you think now? These are the words of Jesus: the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s). If you deny what the Bible says, then you will deny Moses (s) and Jesus (s). If you deny them, then it is incumbent (upon the people) to kill you since you have blasphemed against your Lord, your Prophet and your Book.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “I do not deny the clear things in the Bible, rather I profess them.”The Imam (s) asked others who were present, “Bear witness that he professed.”Then the Imam (s) told the Catholic Archbishop, “O Catholic Archbishop! Ask me any other questions that you wish to ask.”The Catholic Archbishop asked, “What about the disciples of Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s)? How many were they? And tell me about the scholars of the Bible. How many were they?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “You have found the expert! As for (the number of) the disciples, they were twelve men. The best and the most learned of them was Aluqas (Luke). As for (the number of) Christian scholars, there were three men: John (Yohanna), ‘the greatest’, John at Qriqisiya, and John - the al-Daylami at Zijar, who made reference to the Prophet Muhammad (s). It is he who gave the good news to the nation of Jesus and the Children of Israel about the Prophet Muhammd.”The Imam (s) added, “O Christian! By God, we believe in the Jesus who believed in Muhammad (s). We have nothing against Jesus (s) except for his weakness and the paucity of his fasting and prayer.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “By God, you have corrupted your knowledge! Your affair has become weak! I thought that you were the most learned of the Muslims!”Al-Ridha (s) asked, “Why?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Since you said that Jesus was weak with little fasting and praying, while Jesus never broke fasting by day and never slept at night. He always fasted during the day and prayed at night.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “For whom did he fast and pray?” The Catholic Archbishop did not answer, not knowing what to say.Al-Ridha (s) said, “I want to ask you a question.” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Ask. I will respond to you if I know the answer.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Why do you deny that Jesus (s) gave life to the dead with the Honorable the Exalted God’s permission?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “I denied that before, since whoever giveslife to the dead and heals the blind and the leprous is a lord worthy of being worshipped.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Well. Indeed al-Yasa (Elija) did just as Jesus (s) did. He walked on water, gave life to the dead, and healed the blind and the leprous. Why did his nation not adopt him as a Lord? Why did not anyone worship him as a god other than God?”The Prophet Hezqeel (Ezekiel) (s) did just what Jesus (s) did. He gave life to thirty-five men sixty years after their death.” Then the Imam (s) turned towards the Catholic Archbishop and told him, “O Catholic Archbishop! Have you found the following about some of the youth of the Children of Israel in the Torah? When Bukht Nasr (Nebuchadnezzar) invaded Jerusalem, he chose from amongst the Children of Israel who were enslaved and took them with him to go to Babylon. Then the Honorable the Exalted God dispatched al-Yasa’ for them and he gave life to them. This (statement) is in the Torah. No one but an atheist would deny it.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “I have heard about this and know it.” The Imam (s) said, “That is right.”Then the Imam (s) said, “O Jew! See if I read the following Book of the Torah properly.” The Imam (s) then recited some of the verses from the Torah for us. The Jew who was surprised hearing how the Imam (s) was reciting the Torah kept moving his body. He then faced the Christian and asked, “O Christian! Were these before Jesus (s) or was Jesus (s) before them?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “They were before him.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “(People from) the Quraysh (tribe) gathered around God’s Messenger Muhammad (s) and asked him to give life to their dead. He (s) sent along Ali ibn Abi Talib with them and told him, “Go to the cemetery and loudly call the people about whom they have asked, Say, “O so-and-so, so-and-so, etc.” Tell them, “God’s Messenger Muhammad (s) says, ‘Rise with the permission of the Honorable the Exalted God!’ Then they will all arise and brush off the dust from their heads.” The people from the Quraysh tribe walked towards them and asked them about their affairs. They told them that Muhammad was appointed as a Prophet. The people who had risen from the dead said, “We wish we had lived in his age and believed in him!” The Prophet healed the blind, the leprous and the insane. He spoke with the beasts, the birds, the jinn,and Satan. Still, we do not adopt him as a Lord other than God. We do not deny the nobilities of any of these Prophets. But you who have adopted Jesus (s) as a Lord, so then is it permissible for you to adopt al-Yasa and Hizqeel as two Lords, for they did just as Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s) did - acts such as giving life to the dead and else?Moreover, thousands of the Children of Israel left their homeland in fear of death due to plague. God made them die immediately. The people of the village built a fence around them, and left them there until their bones decayed. One of the Prophets of the Children of Israel passed by. He was amazed when he saw many decayed bones. The Honorable the Exalted God revealed to him, “Would you like Me to bring them to life so that you can admonish them?” The Prophet (s) said, “Yes, Lord!” Then the Honorable the Exalted God revealed to him, “Then call them.” He said, “O decayed bones! Rise with God’s permission.” They all rose while brushing off the dust from their heads.”Also Abraham - the friend of God the Merciful (s) - took the birds, cut them into pieces, and put each piece on a mountain top. He called out to them and they came towards him. Moses the son of Imran (s) and seventy of his companions whom he had chosen went to the mountain. They told Moses (s), “You have seen God, then show Him to us.” Moses (s) told them, “I have not seen Him.” But they said, ‘…We shall never believe in thee until we see Allah manifestly…’ A thunderbolt struck them, and burnt them all up. Only Moses (s) survived. Moses (s) said, “O my Lord! I chose seventy men from among the Children of Israel and brought them to the mountain. Shall I return by myself? How shall my people believe what I must tell them? ‘If it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? ’ ’’Then the Honorable the Exalted God gave life to them after their death. You cannot deny all these things which I have told you, for the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms of David and the Quran have mentioned them. If all those who gave life to the dead, healed the blind, the leprous and the mad were adopted as Lords other than God, then you should also adopt them as Lords. O Christian! What is your opinion?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “Yes. You are right. There is no god but God.”Then the Imam (s) turned towards the High Rabbi and told him, “O Jew! Turn to me. I swear to you by the Ten Commandments which were sent down to Moses (the son of Imran) to tell me whether or not there exists the following statement about the Prophet Muhammad and his nation in the Torah, “When the people of the last nation whose followers are the Rider of the Camel who extremely glorifies the Lord - new glorifications in new churches (implying mosques), then let the Children of Israel flee towards them and their dominion so that their hearts may be tranquil, since there will be swords in their hands with which they will take revenge on the unbelievers around the globe.” Is this not written in the Torah?” The High Rabbi said, “Yes, we have found that written in this manner.”Then the Imam (s) asked the Catholic Archbishop, “O Christian! How is your knowledge of the Book of Sha’ya?” He answered, “I know it letter by letter.” Then the Imam (s) asked them both, “Do you know that the following statement is made by him?, ‘O people! I have seen the picture of the Rider of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel - who is as bright as the moon.’” They answered, “Indeed Sha’ya did say that!”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Christian! Do you know that Jesus (s) said, ‘I am going to my Lord and your Lord, and the Paraclete is coming who shall testify to my truth just as I testified for him, and he shall explain everything to you, and he shall be the one to expose all the sins of nations, and he shall be the one to smash down the pillars of unbelief?’” The Catholic Archbishop said, “We accept whatever you cite from the Bible.” The Imam (s) said, “O Catholic Archbishop! Have you found this established in the Bible?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Yes.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Catholic Archbishop! When you lost the first Bible, with whom did you find it?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “We only lost the Bible for one day. Then we found it fresh (in its original state). John and Matthew brought it back to us.”Al-Ridha (s) asked him, “How little your knowledge of the Bible and its scholars is! If what you say is right, then why is there so much dispute amongst you with each other about the Bible? The reason is that there iscontroversy lies in the Bible which is in your hands today. Had it been the same as the first Bible, there would no disputes over it. However, I will clarify this for you myself. Know that when the first Bible was lost, the Christians gathered around their scholars and said to them, ‘’Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s) has been killed, and we have lost the Bible. You are the scholars. What do you have?’ Luke, Mark and John told them, ‘We have memorized the Bible. Do not worry about it. Do not forsake the churches. We will recite each Gospel of the Bible for you on each Sunday until we put it all together.’ Then Luke, Mark, John and Matthew gathered together and put together this Bible after you had lost the first one. These four students were of the first students. Did you know that?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “I did not know this before. Now I have learned it from you due to your noble knowledge of the Bible. I heard things which you knew from you - things which my heart testifies to be the truth. Therefore, I have gained a much better understanding.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “How do you consider what they bear witness to?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “I completely accept whatever they say is right and bear witness to it.” Then Al-Ridha (s) told Al-Ma’mun and those of his family and others who were present, “Be witnesses to this.” They said, “We witness to that.”Then the Imam (s) told the Catholic Archbishop, “I swear by the Son and his Mother to tell us whether you know that Matthew said the following, ‘The Messiah is the son of David, the son of Abraham, the son of Isaac, the son of Jacob, the son of Yehuda, the son of Khadrun.’ Mark said the following regarding the lineage of Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s), ‘He is God’s Word placed in the human body. So it turned into the human form.’ Moreover, Luke said, ‘Jesus the son of Mary and his mother were humans made of flesh and blood. Then the Holy Spirit entered into them.’ You also testify that Jesus had said the following about himself, ‘O disciples! I will tell you the truth. No one will ascend the heavens, except for him who descends therefrom, except for the Rider of the Camel - the Seal of the Prophets, for he will ascend the heavens and then will descend there from.’ What do you have to say about that?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “These are the words of Jesus (s). We do not deny them.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “If so, what do you say about the testimonies of Luke, Mark and Matthew regarding Jesus (s) and the lineage they attributed to him?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “They ascribed lies to Jesus (s).”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O people! Did he not just bear witness that they (Luke, Mark and Matthew) are the Scholars of the Bible and that what they say is the truth?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “O Scholar of the Muslims! I would like you to excuse me from discussing about these men.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Fine. I will excuse you from that. O Christian! Ask me whatever you wish to ask.” The Catholic said, “Let someone else ask you questions. By Jesus (s), I did not think that there was a scholar like you among the Muslims.”Al-Ridha (s) turned towards the High Rabbi and said, “Will you ask me questions or should I ask?” The High Rabbi said, “I will ask. However, I will not accept any proofs from you except those from the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms of David, or the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Do not accept any of my proofs unless they are from the Torah as expressed by Moses (s) - the son of Imran (s), the Bible as expressed by Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s), or the Psalms of David as expressed by David (s).”The High Rabbi said, “How can you prove the Prophethood of Muhammad (s)?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Moses (s) - the son of Imran, Jesus (s) - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s) and David (s) - the Vicegerent of God on the Earth have testified to his Prophethood.”The High Rabbi said, “Provide evidence of the testimony of Moses the son of Imran.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “O Jew! Do you know that Moses said the following to the Children of Israel, ‘A Prophet will come to you from among your brethren. Believe in him and obey him.’ Do you know that the Children of Israel have no brethren other than the Children of Ishmael? Do you know about the ties of kinship between Israel and Ishmael and the relationship that existed between them from the pastthrough Abraham (s)?” The High Rabbi said, “These are the words of Moses. I do not deny them.” Al-Ridha (s) asked him, “Has any Prophet other than Muhammad (s) come from amongst the brethren of the Children of Israel?” He replied, “No.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Is this not correct in your opinion?” The High Rabbi said, “Yes, but I want you to prove its correctness from the Torah.”Al-Ridha (s) asked him, “Do you deny that the Torah says the following to you? ‘There came light from Mount Sina. Light shined upon us from Mount Sa’eer and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran.’” The High Rabbi said, “I am familiar with these words, but I do not know what they mean.’”Al-Ridha (s) said, “I will inform you about them. What is meant when it says ‘There came light from Mount Sina’ is a reference to the Blessed the Sublime God’s revelations to Moses (s) on Mount Sina. And what is meant when it says, ‘Light shined upon us from Mount Sa’eer’ is a reference to the Mountain upon which the Honorable the Exalted God sent revelations to Jesus (s) - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s). Jesus (s) was on that mountain. And what is meant when it says, ‘and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran’ is a reference to a mountain that is one day away from Mecca. As you and your friends said, the Prophet Sha’ya has said in the Torah that ‘I have seen the picture of the Rider of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel - who is as bright as the moon.’ Who is the Rider of the Donkey? Who is the Rider of the Camel?” The High Rabbi said, “I do not know who they are.” The Imam (s) said, “The Rider of the Donkey is Jesus (s) and the Rider of the Camel is Muhammad (s). Do you deny that this is from the Torah?” The High Rabbi said, “No, I do not deny that.”Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “Do you know the Prophet Hayquq (s)?” The High Rabbi said, “Yes, I know him.” The Imam (s) said, “He has said the following which your Book has also stated, ‘God brought down the Bay’an from Mount Faran. The heavens are filled with the glorification of Ahmad and his nation. He will carry his troops at sea just as he carries them on land. He will bring us a new Book after the destruction of the Holy House (in Jerusalem).’ Did you know this (statement) and do you believe in it?” The High Rabbi said, “In fact, the Prophet Hayquq (s) has said this. I will not deny his words.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “David said in his Psalms which you have also read, ‘O my God! Appoint him who will establish the Sunna (practice) after the cessation (of the Prophets).’ Did you know of any Prophet other than Muhammad (s) who has established the Sunna after the cessation (of the Prophets)?”The High Rabbi said, “This is what is said by David. We do not deny it. However, he meant Jesus by that, and it is his era that was the age of cessation.” Al-Ridha (s) told him, “You are wrong. In fact, Jesus (s) endorsed the Sunna (practices) of the Torah until God pulled him up to Himself. It is written in the Bible, ‘The son of pious woman will go, and the Paraclete will come after him. It is he who will preserve the bonds, explain everything to you, and testify to my truth just as I testified for him. I have brought you the examples, and he will bring you the interpretations.’ Do you believe that this statement is in the Bible?”The High Rabbi said, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “O the High Rabbi! I want to ask you about your Prophet Moses (s). The High Rabbi said, “Ask.” The Imam (s) said, “What is the evidence for the Prophethood of Moses?”The Jew said, “He brought miracles which the Prophets before him had not brought.” The Imam (s) asked, “Could you give me an example?” The High Rabbi replied, “He split the sea, turned the cane into a running serpent, cleaved the stones so that springs gushed forth from them, took out his hand shining white for the onlookers, and other signs the like of which other creatures were unable to bring.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “You are right. They are proofs of his Prophethood. He brought the like of which other creatures were unable to bring. Is it obligatory on you to believe in whoever claims Prophethood and performs something which all other creatures are unable to perform?”The High Rabbi said, “No, since there is no one like Moses (s) considering his position near his Lord and his closeness to Him. It is not incumbent upon us to profess the Prophethood of whoever claims it, unless he brings us miracles similar to those brought by Moses (s).”The Imam (s) said, “Then how come you admit the Prophethood of the other Prophets who preceded Moses who did not split the sea; nor didthey cleave the stone so that twelve springs would gush forth from them; nor did they take their hands out shining white as Moses did; nor did they turn the cane into a running serpent.”The Jew replied, “I told you that if they performed miracles as evidence for their Prophethood which all other creatures were unable to perform, and if they brought something the like of which Moses had brought or they followed what Moses had brought, then it is incumbent upon us to believe in them.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “O High Rabbi! What has prevented you from professing (the Prophethood of) Jesus (s) - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s)? Jesus (s) brought the dead to life, healed the blind and the leprous, made birds formed of clay and breathed at them giving them life with God’s permission.”The High Rabbi said, “It is said that he did that, but we did not see it.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Have you seen the miracles performed by Moses? Have you not received this news by way of Moses’s closest trustworthy companions who said he (s) did them?” The High Rabbi said, “Yes. That is so.”The Imam (s) said, “Well. The news about the miracles of Jesus (s) - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s) have reached you in a similar fashion. Why then did you acknowledge Moses (s) and believe in him, but you did not believe in Jesus?” The High Rabbi did not answer. Al-Ridha (s) said, “The same is true about Muhammad (s) and his miracles. The same is true about any other Prophet appointed by God. One of the miracles of Muhammad (s) was that he was a poor hired shepherd. He had not been taught anything. He did not go to any teachers. However, the Quran which he (s) brought contains the stories of the Prophets (s) and the associated news letter by letter. It has narrated the news of the past and the things to come in the future all the way up until the Resurrection Day. The Quran provided information about what they did in hiding or in their homes. He brought innumerable miracles.” The High Rabbi said, “Neither the account about Jesus nor that about Muhammad are considered correct by us. It is not permissible to admit their Prophethood through what is not correct.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Has the witness who testified for Jesus and Muhammad then given false testimony?” The High Rabbi did not answer him.Then the Imam (s) called the Zoroastrian High Priest. Al-Ridha (s) told him, “Let me know about Zoroaster who considered himself to be a Prophet. What is your proof of his Prophethood?” The Zoroastrian High Priest said, “He had miracles which no one ever had before him. Of course, I have not seen him, but the stories of our ancestors tell us that he made legitimate for us things which others had not made legitimate. Therefore, we follow him.”The Imam (s) asked, “You believed in the stories which came to you about him, so you followed him, didn’t you?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (s) said, “This is the case with all other nations. Stories came to them about what the Prophets had accomplished, and what Moses (s), Jesus (s), and Muhammad (s) had all brought to them. So why didn’t you believe in any of these Prophets, having believed in Zoroaster through the stories that came to you about him saying that he brought forth what others did not?” The Zoroastrian High Priest froze in place.Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “O people! If any of you is opposed to Islam and wants to ask me any questions, then let him ask me without any shame.” Imran As-Sa’bee who was an expert in theology stood up and said, “O Scholar of the people. I would not have asked you any questions if you had not invited me to ask. I have been to Kufa, Basra, Syria and Algeria. There I have met many theologians. However, none of them has been able to establish for me the proof that there is One who has no second other than Him and that He remains to be One Being. Will you permit me to ask you this question?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “If Imran As-Sab’ee is present among the people here, it must be you.” He said, “Yes. This is me.” The Imam (s) said, “O Imran! Ask. But I advise you to be fair. Avoid vain talk and nonsense.” Imran said, “My Master! By God, I just want you to prove something which I can adhere to for me. Then I need not seek anything else.” The Imam (s) said, “Ask whatever you wish to ask.” The crowds moved closer to Imran and crowded in on him. Imran As-Sa’bee asked, “Let me know of the first thing and what it created.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “You asked. Now try to understand. As for the One, He has always been One Being. He has neither limits nor does Hehave transient qualities. He will always remain so. Then unprecedentedly He created a different creature with transient qualities and various different limits. He neither placed it in anything, nor did He limit it by anything. He neither created it like anything, nor did He create other thing like it. He then created the creatures in various shapes: pure and impure, different and alike, with various colors, flavors and tastes. He did not create them out of a need for them, nor did He create them to attain a higher rank. He did not sense any increase or decrease in Himself due to this Creation. O Imran! Do you understand this?” Imran said, “By God, yes my Master!”The Imam (s) added, “O Imran! Know that if He had created what He created since He needed them, He would have only created things by which He could fulfill His need. In that case, it would have been better for Him to create several times more than what He created, since the more the helpers were, the more powerful their master would be. O Imran! In that case, His need would be a never-ending one. The more He created, the more newer needs appeared for Him. That is why we say that He did not create the creatures out of need. Through Creation He transfers the needs of some of them to others. And He makes some of them nobler than others without any need of the nobler one or without wanting to take any revenge against those whom He had debased. That is how He has created.”Imran asked, “Master! Was the Being known to Himself by His Own Self?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “It is the case that knowledge of something is required to distinguish it from other things, and to prove its existence through what it is negated about it. However, there was nothing else there to oppose Him to make it necessary to negate. Since there was only Him there was no need to establish limits. O Imran! Do you understand?”Imran said, “Yes, by God, my Master! Then tell me, by what means did He come to know what He knew. Was it done by conscience or by something else?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “If it had been that His Knowledge was acquired by conscience, can’t we then establish any limits for that conscience where Knowledge ends?” Imran answered, “There is no way out.” The Imam (s) then asked him, “Then what is that conscience?” Imran could not provide any answer.Al-Ridha (s) said, “Never mind. O Imran! If I now ask you about that conscience and whether you can recognize it through another conscience, and you answer if the affirmative, have you not then disproved your own statement and claim? O Imran! Is it not more proper for you to know that the One cannot be described by a conscience? And that the most that can be said about Him is that He has done something, or created something?He is not such that one can conceive any directions or parts for Him as can be imagined for the creatures and their parts. Understand this and base your proper knowledge on it.”Imran asked, “O my Master! Can you let me know what are the types of limits for His creatures? What is the meaning and what are the varieties of His creatures?”The Imam (s) said, “You asked. Now understand. In fact, there are six types of limits for His creatures. These are the tangibles; the weighable; the seeable; those that have no weight - that is spirit; those that are seeable but are without any weight, are untouchable, intangible, colorless, and tasteless; and the measurable that are the widths, the forms, width and height. Included amongst them are deeds and movements which make things, act upon them, change them from one state to another, increase them, or reduce them. As for deeds and movements, they pass by since they have no more time than that which is ordained for their need. Whenever a deed is finished and the movement is stopped it ends, but its effects remain just like talking which ends but its effect remains.”Imran said, “O my Master! Will you let me know about the Creator? If He is One, there is nothing other than Him and there is nothing with Him, has He not changed (His Essence) through creating the creatures?”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “He is Eternal. The Honorable the Exalted does not change due to creating the creatures. However, the creatures change through the changes which He exerts upon them.”Imran asked, “O my Master! With what have we recognized Him?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “With something other than Him.” Imran asked, “What is something other than Him?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “His Volition, His Name, His Attribute, and the like which are all originated, created and managed (by Him).”Imran said, “O my Master! Then what is He?” The Imam (s) replied, “He is Light. That means that He guides His creatures from among the people of the heavens and the Earth. You have no rights incumbent upon me more than my professing His Unity to you.”Imran said, “O my Master! Was He not silent before creating the creatures and then He spoke?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Silence does not exist unless there is some utterance before it. An example of this is that it is not said that the lamp is silent and does not utter; nor is it said that the lamp shines implying that it wants to do something to us. The light shining from the lamp is not considered to be the act of the lamp. It is not something separate from the lamp. Therefore, when it is illuminating us we say that it was lit for us by which we found our way around. Through this example you can find what you are after and become enlightened in your affairs.”Imran said, “O my Master! I thought that the Ever-Being is changed in His own Essence by His action of creating the creatures.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Imran! What you said that the Ever-Being will change in one or another way (by acting) and that this change will affect His own Essence, and thereby changes Him. O Imran! Have you ever seen that the changes in fire change it? Have you ever seen heat burn itself? Have you ever seen an eye see itself?” Imran said, “No I have not. O my Master! Will you let me know whether He is in the creatures or the creatures are in Him?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Imran! He is Exalted and above all that. He is not in the creatures; nor are the creatures in Him. He is High above that. I will teach you what you do not know. There is no strength save in God. Tell me about the mirror: are you in it or is it in you? O Imran! If neither one of you is in the other, then by what thing do you reason that you can see your own reflection in it?”Imran said, “Through the light between me and the mirror.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Can you see more of that light in the mirror than what you see in your own eyes?”He answered, “Yes.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Then show it to us!” It was then that the man was too baffled to say a word. The Imam (s) said, “I do not see the light, except leading you and the mirror to come to know each other without being in either one of you. There are many other suchexamples which the ignorant simply cannot comprehend. God is the highest such example.”Then the Imam (s) turned to Al-Ma’mun and told him, “Now it is time to pray.”Imran said, “O my Master! Do not interrupt my questions since I am feeling inclined towards you in my heart.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “We will pray and come back.”Then the Imam (s) stood up. Al-Ma’mun got up, too. Then Al-Ridha (s) prayed inside and the people prayed outside led by Muhammad ibn Ja’far. Then the Imam (s) came out, returned to the meeting, called out to Imran and said, “O Imran! Ask your questions.”Imran said, “O my Master! Will you let me know whether the Unity of the Honorable the Exalted God is perceived through reality or through description?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Certainly, God is the Only Initiator, and the first Ever-Being. He has always been One without anything to accompany Him. He is One and there are no seconds for Him. He is neither definite nor indefinite. He is neither decisive nor allegorical. He is neither mentioned nor forgotten. He is not a thing such that a name of things can fit Him. There is no time for the beginning of His Being. And there is no time until which only He will last. He has not been standing upon anything else, nor will He be standing upon anything. There is nothing up until which He is. There is nothing on which He leans. He had all these attributes before creating anything when there was nothing but Him. Whatever you attribute to Him will be originated attributes which are only means for understanding Him, which anyone possessing understanding can comprehend.Know that innovation, volition, and will have the same meaning with different names. His foremost innovation, will and volition were the letters which He established as the origin of everything, the evidence for all perceived things, and the separator for all vague things. Everything was separated by these letters: things such as the name of right and wrong, action and object, meaning and meaningless. All affairs were run based on them. He did not establish any limited meaning for them other than what they were themselves when He originated the letters. He didnot establish for them any existence other than themselves since they were originated via innovation. Here Light is God’s first deed: The deed of God who is the Light of the heavens and the Earth Himself. It was through that deed which the letters became action. It is the letters upon which speech is based. Expressions are all from the Honorable the Exalted God who taught them to His creatures. There are thirty-three letters. Twenty-eight of them are the letters on which the Arabic language is based. Twenty-two of the twenty-eight letters show the letters of the Assyrian and Hebrew languages. Five of them were separated and are in the rest of the languages of non-Arabs in the regions. These are the five letters which were separated from the twenty-eight letters. Therefore, there are thirty-three letters. It is not permissible to mention more about them than what we have mentioned regarding these five letters which were separated. He then established the letters after counting them and numbering them as His own deed. An example of this is in the Honorable the Exalted God’s words, ‘We but say the word, ‘Be’, and it is.’ Here ‘be’ refers to God’s Creation, and ‘what is created’ refers to the creature. Thus the first Creation by the Honorable the Exalted God was innovation which has neither any weight nor any movement. It is neither heard nor does it have any color. It is intangible. And the second thing that was created are the letters which neither have any weight nor any color. They are neither heard nor described. They are not seeable. The third creature includes all the various kinds of things which are perceptible, tangible, tasteable, and seeable. The Blessed the Sublime God existed before innovation as there has been nothing before the Honorable the Exalted God, and nothing with him. Innovation was created before the letters were created, and the letters do not indicate anything other than themselves.”Al-Ma’mun asked, “How come they do not indicate anything other than themselves?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Surely, the Blessed the Sublime God never combines any of them together unless to mean something. When He combines several letters together, say four, five, and six or more, He uses them to originate a new meaning which did not exist before.”Imran asked, “How can we understand this better?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “This is how it can be understood. When you only want to refer to the letters and not anything else, you mention them one by one and say, a b c d e f g etc. Here you find no meaning in them other than themselves. But when you put several letters together you construct names and attributes for a meaning which you have in mind. They will now demonstrate the meaning for which they were intended. Did you understand this?”Imran said, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Know that an attribute cannot be without what it describes. Also a name cannot be without a meaning. A limit cannot be without a limited. All attributes and names indicate perfection and existence. They do not indicate encompassment, as the limits do. Limits make squares, make triangles, and make hexagons. Indeed the recognition of the Honorable the Exalted God is perceived by attributes and names, not by limits such as length, width, smallness, largeness, color, weight, and the like. No such limits are applicable to the Exalted the All-Holy God, so that His creatures could recognize Him by recognizing themselves. This is certain as I said, but the Honorable the Exalted God’s attributes prove Him. He can be understood through His Names. We can argue about His Existence by referring to the existence of His creatures. A true seeker does not need to see Him with his own eyes, or hear Him with his own ears, or touch Him with his own hands, or encompass Him with his own heart. Were it not the case that His attributes proved Him - Exalted is His Praise - and His Names denoted Him, it was not possible for the taught knowledge of the creatures to perceive Him. Then the creatures would have worshipped His Names and Attributes instead of His Meaning. Were it any different, the Only Worshipped One would have been other than God since God’s Names and Attributes are other than Him. Imran! Did you understand?” Imran said, “Yes, my Master. Please tell me more.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Beware of the sayings of the ignorant people from among those whose hearts are blind and are at a loss - those who claim that the Exalted the All-Holy God is present in the Hereafter for the Reckoning concerning rewards and punishments, but He is not present in this world for the acts of obedience and hope. If it were that the Honorable the Exalted God’s presence was a source of His beingdefective in this world, He would not be present in the Hereafter either. However, these people have gone astray, have become blind, and deaf toward the truth regarding what they do not know. That is according to the Words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘But those who were blind in this world, will be blind in the Hereafter, and most astray from the Path.’ What is meant by blindness here is blindness regarding existing realities. Intellectuals know that reasoning about what exists in the Hereafter is only possible through what exists in this world. Whoever tries to adopt knowledge of that world based upon his own personal views, and seek its existence or tries to perceive it through his own soul, and not through anything else would only get more distant from the facts about that world. That is because the Honorable the Exalted God has entrusted the knowledge of that world to an especial group of people who think, know and understand.”Imran asked, “Is innovation a created being or not?” Imam Al-Ridha (s) answered, “It is a still Creation which cannot be perceived through stillness. It is a created being since it has been created. And it is the Sublime God who has originated it. Thus it has become a creature. In other words, there only exist the Honorable the Exalted God and His creatures. There exists no third thing in between, and there is no third thing other than them. Whatever the Honorable the Exalted God creates does not disobey from being His creature. What is created is either still, moving, different, harmonious, known, or ambiguous. Whatever is bounded is the Honorable the Exalted God’s creature.Moreover, know that all the things which the senses find for you are meanings perceived by the senses, and every sense demonstrates what the Honorable the Exalted God has placed in its perception, and the heart understands all of that. Know that the One who is Ever-Standing without any ordination or bounds created creatures ordained by bounds and ordination. What He created were two creatures: the ordination and the ordained. Neither one had any color, weight or taste. He established one as the means of perceiving the other and made them such that they could be perceived on their own. He did not create anything which could stand alone relying only on itself so as to provide a means for arguing about and proving His own existence.Thus the Blessed the Sublime God is One and Only. There is no second one to support Him in order to enable Him to stand, or to assist Him or protect Him. However, the creatures support one another through the permission and will of the Sublime God. People have differences of opinion over this subject to the extent that they have gone astray, become perplexed, and seek salvation from darkness by means of darkness through describing the Sublime God using their own qualities. In this way, they have become very far away from the truth. Had they described the Honorable the Exalted God using His own Attributes, and described the creatures with the qualities of the creatures, they would have spoken through understanding and certitude and would not have come up with so many differences of opinion over Him. Since they sought that which would perplex them, and get entrapped, they became confused. God guides whomever He wills to the straight path.”Imran said, “O my Master! I bear witness that He is just as you have described. However, I still have one more question to ask.” The Imam (s) said, “Ask whatever you wish to ask.”Imran said, “I want to ask you what the All-Wise (God) is contained in. Has anything encompassed Him? Does He change from one state to another state? Is He in need of anything?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Imran! I will tell you, so understandWhom you have questioned about. He is the most ambiguous issues which the creatures face. As for those who are deficient in understanding, they do not recognize Him. As for those who are just and can reason, they are not incapable of understanding Him. First of all, if He had created the creatures due to needing them, then it would be proper to say that He changes His Location to the location of what He creates because of His need for them. However, the Honorable the Exalted God has not created anything out of need. He is always stable. Neither is He on something, or something is on Him. However, it is the creatures which hold each other, enter into one another, and leave one another. As for the Great and All-Holy God, He holds all of that by His Might. He does not enter anything and does not leave anything. Its preservation does not tire Him, nor is He incapable of holding it. None of the creatures knows how that is, except for the Honorable the Exalted God and His Messengers, the People who know His Secrets, those whorun the Affairs, and His Guardians who carry out His Laws. God Himself has informed them about it. In fact, His command is like the twinkling of an eye. If He wills a thing, He only says to it be, ‘We but say the word, ‘Be’, and it is.’  according to His intent and will. Nothing that He has created is closer to Him than any other thing. O Imran! Have you understood?” Imran said, “Yes, my Master. I understood. I bear witness that the Sublime God is as you described Him to be, He is One. I also witness that Muhammad (s) - his servant - is appointed to guide and lead to the right religion.” He then faced the Qibla and fell into prostration.Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said, “When the other rhetoricians heard what Imran al-Sabee - who was very hard to defeat in arguments and no one had ever defeated him before in arguments - none of them dared approach Al-Ridha (s), and they asked him no more questions. Slowly the sun set. Then Al-Ma’mun and Al-Ridha (s) stood up, went inside and the people left.I was sitting along with some of my friends when Muhammad ibn Ja’far called me in. I went to see him.He told me, “O Nawfali! Did you see what your friend (the Imam (s)) did?” Al-Nawfali replied, “By God! No. I did not think that Ali ibn Musa Al-Ridha (s) could plumb such depths. I did not know that him in this way. He never spoke about theology in Medina and theologians never gathered around him.” I said, “The pilgrims come to him and ask him about the lawful and the unlawful and he answers them. Sometimes rhetoricians come to him and argue with him, and he plunges into theology.”Muhammad ibn Ja’far said, “O Aba Muhammad! I fear that this man (i.e. Al-Ma’mun) will envy him, poison him or injure him. So advise him to refrain from these things.”Al-Nawfali added, “I said, ‘He will not listen to me. This man (Al-Ma’mun) only wants to test him to see whether he possesses any of the knowledge of his forefathers (s).’He told me, “Tell him that his uncle does not like him to do such things and wishes him to quit doing these things.” When we returned to Al-Ridha’s (s) house I related to the Imam (s) the message from his uncle. Then the Imam (s) smiled and said, “May God protect my uncle. I knowhim well. Why is he upset? O servant! Go to Imran al-Sa’ebi and bring him here.”I said, “May I be your ransom! I know where he is. He is with some of the Shiite brethren.” The Imam (s) said, “Don’t worry. Take a horse for him to ride on and bring him here.” I went and brought Imran. The Imam (s) welcomed him and asked for a robe of honor which he (s) put on Imran. The Imam also gave him a horse and asked for ten-thousand Dinars which he (s) donated to Imran.Imran said, “May I be your ransom! You have followed in the footsteps of your grandfather - the Commander of the Faithful (s).” The Imam (s) said, “We prefer this.” Then the Imam (s) ordered dinner and had me sit on his right side and had Imran sit on his left side. After eating dinner, the Imam (s) told Imran, “Go now and come back in the morning. Then I will give you food from Medina.”From then on many people came to Imran to have a debate. He used to respond to their arguments and disprove them until they left. Al-Ma’mun granted him ten thousand Dirhams. Al-Fadhl gave him some money, too. Then he appointed him as the director over the alms in (the city of) Balkh where he attained much good.",

عَدْلٍ؟قَالَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ : بَلَى.قَالَ: فَأَقِمْ شَاهِدَيْنِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَهْلِ مِلَّتِكَ عَلَى نُبُوَّةِ مُحَمَّدٍ (صَلّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ) مِمَّنْ لاَ تُنْكِرُهُ النَّصْرَانِيَّةُ، وَسَلْنَا مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَهْلِ مِلَّتِنَا.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ: اَلآنَ جِئْتَ بِالنَّصَفَةِ يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ. اَلاَ تَقْبَلُ مِنِّي العَدْلَ المُقَدَّمَ عِنْدَ المَسِيحِ عِيسَى بْنِ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ؟قَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: وَمَنْ هَذا العَدْلُ؟ سَمِّهِ لِي.قَالَ: مَا تَقُولُ بِيُوحَنّا الدَّيْلَمِيِّ؟قَالَ: بَخٍ بَخٍ، ذَكَرْتَ أَحَبَّ النّاسِ إلى المَسِيحِ.قَالَ: فَأَقْسَمْتُ عَلَيْكَ هَلْ نَطَقَ الإنْجِيلُ أَنَّ يُوحَنّا قَالَ: إنمَّا المَسِيحُ أخْبَرَنِي بِدِينِ مُحَمَّدٍ العَرَبِيِّ وَبَشَّرَنِي بِهِ أَنَّهُ يَكُونُ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ فَبَشَّرْتُ بِهِ الحَوَارِيِّينَ فَآمَنُوا بِهِ؟قَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: قَدْ ذَكَرَ ذَلِكَ يُوحَنّا عَنِ المَسِيحِ وَبَشَّرَ بِنُبُوَّةِ رَجُلٍ وَبِأَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ وَوَصِيِّهِ وَلَمْ يُلَخِّصْ مَتى يَكُونُ ذَلِكَ، وَلَمْ تُسَمَّ لَنَا القَوْمُ فَنَعْرِفَهُمْ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: فَإنْ جِئْنَاكَ بِمَنْ يَقْرَأُ الإنْجِيلَ فَتَلا عَلَيْكَ ذِكْرَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَأَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ وَأُمَّتِهِ، أَتُؤْمِنُ بِهِ؟قَالَ: سَديداً.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ لِنَسْطاسَ الرُّومِيِّ: كَيْفَ حِفْظُكَ لِلسِّفْرِ الثّالِثِ مِنَ الإنْجِيلِ؟قَالَ: مَا أحْفَظَنِي لَهُ.ثُمَّ الْتَفَتَ إلى رَأسِ الجَالُوتِ فَقَالَ: أَلَسْتَ تَقْرَأُ الإنْجِيلَ؟ قَالَ: بَلَى لَعَمْرِي.قَالَ: فَخُذْ عَلَى السِّفْرِ، فَإنْ كَانَ فِيهِ ذِكْرُ مُحَمَّدٍ وَأَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ وَأُمَّتِهِ فَاشْهَدوا لِي، وَإنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ فِيهِ ذِكْرُهُ فَلا تَشْهَدُوا لِي.ثُمَّ قَرَأَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ السِّفْرَ الثَّالِثَ، حَتّى إذَا بَلَغَ ذِكْرَ النَّبِيِّ صَلّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَقَفَ ثُمَّ قَالَ: يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ إنّي أسْأَلُكَ بِحَقِّ المَسِيحِ وَأُمِّهِ، أَتَعْلَمُ أنّي عَالِمٌ بِالإنْجِيلِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ.ثُمَّ تَلاَ عَلَيْنَا ذِكْرَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَأَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ وَأُمَّتِهِ ثُمَّ قَالَ: مَا تَقُولُ يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ؟ هَذَا قَوْلُ عِيسَى بْنِ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ فَإنْ كَذَّبْتَ بِمَا يَنْطِقُ بِهِ الإنْجِيلُ فَقَدْ كَذَّبْتَ مُوسَى وَعِيسَى عَلَيْهِمَا السَّلامُ، وَمَتى أَنْكَرْتَ هَذَا الذِّكْرَ وَجَبَ عَلَيْكَ القَتْلُ لأَنَّكَ تَكُونُ قَدْ كَفَرْتَ بِرَبِّكَ وَنَبِيِّكَ وَبِكِتَابِكَ.قَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: لا أُنْكِرُ مَا قَدْ بَانَ لِي فِي الإنْجِيلِ، وَإنّي لَمُقِرٌّ بِهِ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: إشْهَدُوا عَلَى إقْرَارِهِ. ثُمَّ قَالَ: يَا جَاثْلِيقُ، سَلْ عَمّا بَدا لَكَ.قَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: أخْبِرْنِي عَنْ حَوَارِيِّي عِيسَى بْنِ مَرَيْمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ؛ كَمْ كَانَ عِدَّتَهُمْ؟ وَعَنْ عُلَمَاءِ الإنْجِيلِ؛ كَمْ كَانوا؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: عَلَى الْخَبِيرِ سَقَطْتَ! أمّا الحَوَارِيُّونَ فَكَانُوا اثْنَيْ عَشَرَ رَجُلاً، وَكَانَ أَعْلَمَهُمْ وَأَفْضَلَهُمْ ألُوقَا. وَأمّا عُلَمَاءُ النَّصَارَى فَكَانوا ثَلاثَةَ رِجَالٍ: يُوحَنّا الأَكْبَرُ بِأَجّ، وَيُوحَنّا بِقِرْقِيسِيا، وَيُوحَنّا الدَّيْلَمِيَّ بِرَجَازَ. وَعِنْدَهُ كَانَ ذِكْرُ النَّبِيِّ صَلّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَذِكْرُ أهْلِ بَيْتِهِ وَأُمَّتِهِ، وَهُوَ الَّذِي بَشَّرَ أُمَّةَ عِيسَى وَبَنِي إسْرَائِيلَ بِهِ.ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ: يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ، وَاللهِ إنّا لَنُؤْمِنُ بِعِيسَى الَّذِي آمَنَ بِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَمَا نَنْقِمُ عَلَى عِيساكُمْ شَيْئاً إلاّ ضَعْفَهُ وَقِلَةَ صِيامِهِ وَصَلاتِهِ.قَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: أفْسَدْتَ وَاللهِ عِلْمَكَ وَضَعَّفْتَ أمْرَكَ وَمَا كُنْتُ ظَنَنْتُ إلاّ أنَّكَ أعْلَمُ أهْلِ الإسْلاَمِ! قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: وَكَيْفَ ذَاكَ؟قَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: مِنْ قَوْلِكَ أنَّ عِيسَى كَانَ ضَعِيفاً قَلِيلَ الصِّيَامِ قَلِيلَ الصَّلاَةِ؛ وَمَا أفْطَرَ عِيسَى يَوماً قَطُّ وَلاَ نَامَ بِلَيْلٍ قَطُّ وَمَا زَالَ صَائِمَ الدَّهْرِ وَقَائِمَ اللَّيْلِ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: فَلِمَنْ كَانَ يَصُومُ وَيُصَلِّي؟! قَالَ: فَخَرِسَ الجَاثْلِيقُ وَانْقَطَعَ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ، أَسْأَلُكَ عَنْ مَسْأَلَةٍ. قَالَ: سَلْ؛ فَإنْ كَانَ عِنْدِي عِلْمُهَا أَجَبْتُكَ. قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: مَا أَنْكَرْتَ أنَّ عِيسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ كَانَ يُحْيِي المَوْتَى بِإذْنِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ؟قَالَ الجَــاثْلِيقُ: أنْكَـرْتُ ذَلِكَ مِنْ أَجْلِ أنَّ مَنْ أحْيَى المَوْتَى وَأبْرَأَ الأَكْمَهَ وَالأَبْرَصَ فَهُوَرَبٌّ مُسْتَحِقٌّ لأَنْ يُعْبَدَ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ: فَإنَّ الْيَسَعَ قَدْ صَنَعَ مِثْلَ صُنْعِ عِيسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ: مَشَى عَلَى المَاءِ وَأَحْيَى المَوْتَى وَأبْرَأَ الأَكْمَهَ وَالأَبْرَصَ، فَلَمْ تَتَّخِذْهُ أُمَّتُهُ رَبّاً، وَلَمْ يَعْبُدْهُ أَحَدٌ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ. وَلَقَدْ صَنَعَ حِزْقِيلُ النَّبِيُّ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ مِثْلَ مَا صَنَعَ عِيسَى بْنِ مَرْيَمَ فَأَحْيَا خَمْسَةً وَثَلاثِينَ ألْفِ رَجُلٍ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَوْتِهِمْ بِسِتِّينَ سَنَةً.ثُمَّ الْتَفَتَ إلى رَأسِ الجَالُوتِ فَقَالَ لَهُ: يَا رَأسَ الجَالُوتِ، أَتَجِدُ هَؤُلاءِ فِي شَبَابِ بَنِي إسْرَائِيلَ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ؟ إخْتَارَهْمْ بُخْتْ نُصَّرَ مِنْ سَبْيِ بَنِي إسْرَائِيلِ حِينَ غَزا بَيْتَ المَقْدِسِ، ثُمَّ انْصَرَفَ بِهِمْ إلى بَابِلَ فَأَرْسَلَهُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إلَيْهِمْ فَأحْيَاهُمْ. هَذا فِي التَّوْرَاةِ لاَ يَدْفَعُهُ إلاّ كَافِرٌ مِنْكُمْ. قَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: قَدْ سَمِعْنَا بِهِ وَعَرَفْنَاهُ. قَالَ: صَدَقْتَ.ثُمَّ قَالَ: يَا يَهُودِيُّ، خُذْ عَلَى هَذا السِّفْرِ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ.فَتَلاَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْنَا مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ آيَاتٍ، فَأَقْبَلَ اليَهُودِيُّ يَتَرَجَّجُ لِقِرائَتِهِ وَيَتَعَجَّبُ! ثُمَّ أقْبَلَ عَلَى النَّصْرَانِيِّ فَقَالَ: يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ، أَفَهَؤُلاءِ كَانُوا قَبْلَ عِيسَى أَمْ عِيسَى كَانَ قَبْلَهُمْ؟قَالَ: بَلْ كَانُوا قَبْلَهُ.فَقَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: لَقَدِ اجْتَمَعَتْ قُرَيْشٌ عَلَى رَسُولِ اللهِ صَلّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ فَسَأَلُوهُ أَنْ يُحْيِيَ لَهُمْ مَوْتَاهُمْ، فَوَجَّهَ مَعَهُمْ عَلِيُّ بْنُ أبِي طَالِبٍ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ فَقَالَ لَهُ: إذْهَبْ إلى الجَبّانَةِ، فَنَادِ بِأَسْمَاءِ هَؤُلاءِ الرَّهْطِ الَّذِينَ يَسْأَلُونَ عَنْهُمْ بِأَعْلَى صَوْتِكِ: يَا فُلانُ وَيَا فُلانُ وَيَا فُلانُ، يَقُولُ لَكُمْ مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ اللهِ (صَلّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ) قُومُوا بِإذْنِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ. فَقَامُوا يَنْفِضُونَ التُّرَابَ عَنْ رُؤوسِهِمْ. فَأَقْبَلَتْ قُرَيْشٌ يَسْأَلُونَهُمْ عَنْ أُمُورِهِمْ. ثُمَّ أخْبَرُوهُمْ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً بُعِثَ نَبِيّاً، فَقَالُوا: وَدِدْنَا أنّا أدْرَكْنَاهُ فَنُؤْمِنَ بِهِ. وَلَقَدْ أبْرَأَ الأَكْمَهَ وَالأَبْرَصَ وَالمَجَانِينَ، وَكَلَّمَهُ البَهَائِمُ وَالطَّيْرُ وَالجِنُّ وَالشَّيَاطِينُ، وَلَمْ نَتَّخِذْهُ رَبّاً مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ،وَلَمْ نُنْكِرْ لأَحَدٍ مِنْ هَؤُلاءِ فَضْلَهُمْ. فَمَتى إتَّخَذْتُمْ عِيسَى رَبّاً جَازَ لَكُمْ أنْ تَتَّخِذُوا الْيَسَعَ وَحِزْقِيلَ رَبّاً، لأَنَّهُمَا قَدْ صَنَعَا مِثْلَ مَا صَنَعَ عِيسَى بْنِ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ مِنْ إحْيَاءِ المَوْتَى وَغَيْرِهِ. وَإنَّ قَوْماً مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيلَ خَرَجُوا مِنْ بِلاَدِهِمْ مِنَ الطّاعُونِ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ فَأَمَاتَهُمُ اللهُ فِي سَاعَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، فَعَمَدَ أَهْلُ تِلْكَ القَرْيَةِ فَحَظَرُوا عَلَيْهِمْ حَظِيرَةً فَلَمْ يَزالُوا فِيهَا حَتّى نَخِرَتْ عِظَامُهُمْ وَصَارُوا رَمِيماً. فَمَرَّ بِهِمْ نَبِيٌّ مِنْ أنْبِيَاءِ بَنِي إسْرَائِيلَ فَتَعَجَّبَ مِنْهُمْ وَمِنْ كَثْرَةِ العِظَامِ الْبَالِيَةِ، فَأَوْحَى اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إلَيْهِ: أَتُحِبُّ أَنْ أُحْيِيَهُمْ لَكَ فَتُنْذِرَهُمْ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ يَا رَبِّ.فَأَوْحَى اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إلَيْهِ أنْ نَادِهِمْ. فَقَالَ: أيَّتُهَا العِظَامُ البَالِيَةُ، قُومِي بِإذْنِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ. فَقَامُوا أحْيَاءَ أجْمَعِينَ يَنْفُضُونَ التُّرَابَ عَنْ رُؤوسِهِمْ.ثُمَّ إنَّ إبْرَاهِيمَ خَلِيلِ الرَّحْمَنِ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ حِينَ أخَذَ الطَّيْرَ فَقَطَّعَهُنَّ قِطَعاً، ثُمَّ وَضَعَ عَلَى كُلِّ جَبَلٍ مِنْهُنَّ جُزْءاً، ثُمَّ نَادَاهُنَّ فَأَقْبَلْنَ سَعْياً إلَيْهِ.ثُمَّ مُوسَى بْنِ عِمْرَانَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ وَأصْحَابُهُ السَّبْعُونَ الَّذِينَ اخْتَارَهُمْ؛ صَارُوا مَعَهُ إلى الجَبَلِ فَقَالُوا لَهُ: إنَّكَ قَدْ رَأَيْتَ اللهَ سُبْحَانُهُ، فَأَرِنَاهُ كَمَا رَأَيْتَهُ! فَقَالَ لَهُمْ: إنّي لَمْ أَرَهُ.فَقَالُوا: لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتّى نَرَى اللهَ جَهْرَةً. فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّاعِقَةُ فَاحْتَرَقوا عَنْ آخِرِهِمْ، وَبَقِيَ مُوسَى وَحِيداً فَقَالَ: يَا رَبِّ إخْتَرْتُ سَبْعِينَ رَجُلاً مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيلَ فَجِئْتُ بِهِمْ وَأرْجَعُ وَحْدِي! فَكَيْفَ يُصَدِّقُنِي قَوْمِي بِمَا أُخْبِرُهُمْ بِهِ؟ فَلَوْ شِئْتَ أَهْلَكْتَهُمْ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَإيَّايَ. أتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَلَ السُّفَهَاءُ مِنّا؟ فَأحْيَاهُمُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَوْتِهِمْ.وَكُلَّ شَيْءٍ ذَكَرْتُهُ لَكَ مِنْ هَذا لا تَقْدِرُ عَلَى دَفْعِهِ، لأَنَّ التَّوْرَاةَ وَالإنْجِيلَ وَالزَّبُورَ وَالفُرْقَانَ قَدْ نَطَقَتْ بِهِ, فَإنْ كَانَ كُلُّ مَنْ أحْيَى المَوْتَى وَأبْرَأَ الأَكْمَهَ وَالأبْرَصَ وَالمَجَانِينَ يُتَّخَذُ رَبّاً مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَاتَّخِذْ هَؤُلاءِ كُلَّهُمْ أرْباباً! مَا تَقُولُ يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ؟فَقَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: اَلقَوْلُ قَوْلُكَ، وَلا إلَهَ إلاّ اللهُ.ثُمَّ الْتَفَتَ إلى رَأسِ الجَالُوتِ فَقَالَ: يَا يَهُودِيُّ، أقْبِلْ عَلَيَّ أسْأَلْكَ بِالعَشْرَةِ الآيَاتِ الَّتِي أُنْزِلَتْ عَلَى مُوسَى بْنِ عِمْرَانَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ. هَلْ تَجِدُ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ مَكْتُوباً بِنَبَأِ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَأُمَّتِهِ: إذَا جَاءَتِ الأُمَّةُ الأَخِيرَةُ أتْبَاعُ رَاكِبِ البَعِيرِ يُسَبِّحُونَ الرَّبَّ جِدّاً جِدّاً تَسْبِيحاً جَدِيداً فِي الكَنَائِسِ الجُدُدِ، فَلْيَفْزَعْ بَنُو إسْرَائِيلَ إلَيْهِمْ وَإلى مَلِكِهِمْ لِتَطْمَئِنَّ قُلُوبُهُمْ فَإنَّ بِأيْدِيهِمْ سُيُوفاً يَنْتَقِمُونَ بِها مِنَ الأُمَمِ الكَافِرَةِ فِي أقْطَارِ الأَرْضِ. أهَكَذا هُوَ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ مَكْتُوبٌ؟ قَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: نَعَمْ! إنَّا لَنَجِدُهُ كَذَلِكَ. ثُمَّ قَالَ لِلْجَاثْلِيقِ: يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ! كَيْفَ عِلْمُكَ بِكِتَابِ شَعْيا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ؟ قَالَ: أعْرِفُهُ حَرْفاً حَرْفاً.قَالَ لَهُمَا: أتَعْرِفَانِ هَذا مِنْ كَلامِهِ يَا قَوْمُ: إنّي رَأَيْتُ صُورَةَ رَاكِبِ الحِمَارِ لابِساً جَلابِيبَ النُّورِ، وَرَأيْتُ رَاكِبَ البَعِيرِ ضَوؤهُ مِثْلَ ضَوْءِ القَمَرِ؟ فَقَالا: قَدْ قَالَ ذَلِكَ شَعْيا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ، هَلْ تَعْرِفُ فِي الإنْجِيلِ قَوْلَ عِيسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ: إنّي ذَاهِبٌ إلى رَبِّكُمْ وَرَبّي، وَالبَارْقَلِيطا جَاءَ هُوَ الَّذِي يَشْهَدُ لِي بِالحَقِّ كَمَا شَهِدْتُ، وَهُوَ الَّذِي يُفَسِّرُ لَكُمْ كُلَّ شَيءٍ، وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَبْدَأُ فَضَائِحَ الأُمَمِ، وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَكْسِرُ عَمُودَ الكُفْرِ؟فَقَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: مَا ذَكَرْتَ شَيْئاً مِنَ الإنْجِيلِ إلاّ وَنَحْنُ مُقِرُّونَ بِهِ.فَقَالَ: أتَجِدُ هَذا الإنْجِيلَ ثَابِتاً يَا جَاثْلِيقُ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: يَا جَاثْلِيقُ، ألاَ تُخْبِرُنِي عَنِ الإنْجِيلِ الأَوَّلِ حِينَ افْتَقَدْتُمُوهُ عِنْدَ مَنْ وَجَدْتُمُوهُ، وَمَنْ وَضَعَ لَكُمْ هَذا الإنْجِيلَ؟فَقَالَ لَهُ: مَا افْتَقَدْنَا الإنْجِيلَ إلاّ يَوْماً وَاحِداً حَتّى وَجَدْنَاهُ غَضّاً طَرِيّاً، فَأَخْرَجَهُ إلَيْنَا يُوحَنّا وَمَتّى. فَقَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: مَا أَقَلَّ مَعْرِفَتَكَ بِسُنَنِ الإنْجِيلِ وَعُلَمَائِهِ! فَإنْ كَانَ هَذا كَمَا تَزْعُمُ، فَلِمَ اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِي الإنْجِيلِ؟ وَإنَّمــا وَقَـعَ الاخْتِلافُ فِي هَذا الإنْجِيلِ الَّذِي فِيأيَادِيكُمُ الْيَوْمَ. فَلَوْ كَانَ عَلَى الْعَهْدِ الأَوَّلِ لَمْ تَخْتَلِفُوا فِيهِ، وَلَكِنِّي مُفِيدُكَ عِلْمَ ذَلِكَ؛ إعْلَمْ أنَّهُ لَمَّا افْتُقِدَ الإنْجِيلُ الأَوَّلُ اجْتَمَعَتِ النَّصَارَى إلى عُلَمَائِهِمْ فَقَالُوا لَهُمْ: قُتِلَ عِيسَى بْنُ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ وَافْتَقَدْنَا الإنْجِيلَ وَأنْتُمُ العُلَمَاءُ، فَمَا عِنْدَكُمْ؟فَقَالَ لَهُمْ أَلُوقَا وَمَرْقَابُوسُ: إنَّ الإنْجِيلَ فِي صُدُورِنَا وَنَحْنُ نُخْرِجُهُ إلَيْكُمْ سِفْراً سِفْراً فِي كُلِّ أَحَدٍ، فَلا تَحْزَنُوا عَلَيْهِ، وَلا تُخْلُوا الكَنَائِسَ، فَإنّا سَنَتْلُوهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي كُلِّ أَحَدٍ سِفْراً سِفْراً حَتّى نَجْمَعَهُ كُلَّهُ. فَقَعَدَ أَلُوقَا وَمَرْقَابُوسُ وَيُوحَنّا وَمَتّى فَوَضَعُوا لَكُمْ هَذا الإنْجِيلَ بَعْدَ مَا افْتَقَدْتُمُ الإنْجِيلَ الأَوَّلَ. وَإنَّما كَانَ هَؤلاءِ الأَرَبَعَةُ تَلامِيذَ تَلامِيذِ الأَوَّلِينَ. أعَلِمْتَ ذَلِكَ؟ فَقَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: أمّا هَذا فَلَمْ أعْلَمْهُ، وَقَدْ عَلِمْتُهُ الآنَ، وَبَانَ لِي مِنْ فَضْلِ عِلْمِكَ بِالإنْجِيلِ وَسَمِعْتُ أشْيَاءَ مِمّا عَلِمْتُهُ، شَهِدَ قَلْبِي أنَّها حَقٌّ فَاسْتَزَدْتُ كَثِيراً مِنَ الفَهْمِ.فَقَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ : فَكَيْفَ شَهَادَةُ هَؤلاءِ عِنْدَكَ؟قَالَ: جَائِزَةٌ! هَؤلاءِ عُلَمَاءُ الإنْجِيلِ، وَكُلُّ مَا شَهِدُوا بِهِ فَهُوَ حَقٌّ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ لِلْمَأمُونِ وَمَنْ حَضَرَهُ مِنْ أهْلِ بَيْتِهِ وَمِنْ غَيْرِهِ: إشْهَدُوا عَلَيْهِ.قَالوا: قَدْ شَهِدْنَا.ثُمَّ قَالَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ لِلْجَاثْلِيقِ: بِحَقِّ الابْنِ وَأُمِّهِ، هَلْ تَعْلَمُ أنَّ مَتّى قَالَ إنَّ الْمَسِيحَ هُوَ ابْنُ دَاوُودَ بْنِ إبْرَاهِيمَ بْنِ إسْحَاقَ بْنِ يَعْقُوبَ بْنِ يَهُوذا بْنِ خَضْرونَ؟ وَقَالَ مَرْقَابُوسُ فِي نَسَبِ عِيسَى بْنِ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ إنَّهُ كَلِمَةُ اللهِ أَحَلَّهَا فِي جَسَدِ الآدَمِيِّ فَصَارَتْ إنْساناً. وَقَالَ ألُوقَا إنَّ عِيسَى بْنَ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ وَأُمَّهُ كَانا إنْسَانَيْنِ مِنْ لَحْمٍ وَدَمٍ، فَدَخَلَ فِيهَا الرُّوحُ القُدُسُ. ثُمَّ إنَّكَ تَقُولُ مِنْ شَهَادَةِ عِيسَى عَلَى نَفْسِهِ: حَقّاً أقُولُ لَكُمْ يَا مَعْشَرَ الحَوَارِيِّينَ: إنَّهُ لاَ يَصْعَدُ إلى السَّمَاءِ إلاّ مَنْ نَزَلَ مِنْهَا إلاّ رَاكِبَ البَعِيرِ خَاتَمَ الأنْبِيَاءِ، فَإنَّهُ يَصْعَدُ إلى السَّمَاءِ وَيَنْزِلُ. فَمَا تَقُولُ فِي هَذا القَوْلِ؟قَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: هَذا قَوْلُ عِيسَى لاَ نُنْكِرُهُ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: فَمَا تَقُولُ فِي شَهَادَةِ ألُوقا وَمَرْقَابُوسَ وَمتّى عَلَى عِيسَى وَمَا نَسَبُوهُ إلَيْهِ؟قَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: كَذَبوا عَلَى عِيسَى.فَقَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: يَا قَوْمُ، ألَيْسَ قَدْ زَكَّاهُمْ وَشَهِدَ أنَّهُمْ عُلَمَاءُ الإنْجِيلِ وَقَوْلَهُمْ حَقٌّ.فَقَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: يَا عَالِمَ المُسْلِمِينَ، أُحِبُّ أنْ تَعْفِيَنِي مِنْ أمْرِ هَؤلاءِ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: فَإنّا قَدْ فَعَلْنَا. سَلْ يَا نَصْرَانِيُّ عَمّا بَدَا لَكَ.قَالَ الجَاثْلِيقُ: لِيَسْألْكَ غَيْرِي، فَلا وَحَقِّ الْمَسِيحِ مَا ظَنَنْتُ أَنَّ فِي عُلَمَاءِ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِثْلَكَ.فَالْتَفَتَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ إِلَى رَأْسِ الْجَالُوتِ فَقَالَ لَهُ: تَسْأَلُنِي أوْ أسْأَلُكَ؟فَقَالَ: بَلْ أسْأَلُكَ، وَلَسْتُ أقْبَلُ مِنْكَ حُجَّةً إلاّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ أوْ مِنَ الإنْجِيلِ أوْ مِنْ زَبُورِ دَاوُودَ أوْ بِمَا فِي صُحُفِ إبْرَاهِيمَ وَمُوسَى.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: لاَ تَقْبَلْ مِنّي حُجَّةً إلاّ بِمَا تَنْطِقُ بِهِ التَّوْرَاةُ عَلَى لِسَانِ مُوسَى بْنِ عِمْرَانَ، وَالإنْجِيلُ عَلَى لِسَانِ عِيسَى بْنِ مَرْيَمَ، وَالزَّبُورُ عَلَى لِسَانِ دَاوُودَ.فَقَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: مِنْ أيْنَ تُثْبِتُ نُبُوَّةَ مُحَمَّدٍ (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ)؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: شَهِدَ بِنُبُوَّتِهِ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَعِيسَى بْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَدَاوُودُ خَلِيفَةُ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فِي الأرْضِ. فَقَالَ لَهُ: ثَبِّتْ قَوْلَ مُوسَى بْنِ عِمْرَانَ.فَقَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: هَلْ تَعْلَمُ يَا يَهُودِيُّ أنَّ مُوسَى أوْصَى بَنِي إسْرَائِيلَ فَقَالَ لَهُمْ: إنَّهُ سَيَأتِيكُمْ نَبِيٌّ مِنْ إخْوَانِكُمْ. بِهِ فَصَدِّقُوا وَمِنْهُ فَاسْمَعُوا. فَهَلْ تَعْلَمُ أنَّ لِبَنِي إسْرَائِيلَ إخْوَةً غَيْرَ وُلْدِ إسْمَاعِيلَ إنْ كُنْتَ تَعْرِفُ قَرَابَةَ إسْرَائِيلَ مِنْ إسْمَاعِيلَ وَالسَّبَبَ الَّذِي بَيْنَهُمَامِنْ قِبَلِ إبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ؟ فَقَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: هَذا قَوْلُ مُوسَى لاَ نَدْفَعُهُ. فَقَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: هَلْ جَاءَكُمْ مِنْ إخْوَةِ بَنِي إسْرَائِيلَ نَبِيٌّ غَيْرُ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ؟ قَالَ: لاَ. قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: أوَلَيْسَ قَدْ صَحَّ هَذا عِنْدَكُمْ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ. وَلَكِنِّي أُحِبُّ أنْ تُصَحِّحَهُ إلَيَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ. فَقَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: هَلْ تُنْكِرُ أنَّ التَّوْرَاةَ تَقُولُ لَكُمْ: جَاءَ النُّورُ مِنْ قِبَلِ طُورِ سَيْنَاءَ، وَأضَاءَ لَنَا مِنْ جَبَلِ سَاعِيرَ، وَاسْتَعْلَنَ عَلَيْنَا مِنْ جَبَلِ فَارَانَ؟ قَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: أعْرِفُ هَذِهِ الكَلِمَاتِ وَمَا أعْرِفُ تَفْسِيرَهَا.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: أنَا أُخْبِرُكَ بِهِ: أمَّا قَوْلُهُ: جَاءَ النُّورُ مِنْ قِبَلِ طُورِ سَيْنَاءَ، فَذَلِكَ وَحْيُ اللهِ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى الَّذِي أنْزَلَهُ عَلَى جَبَلِ طُورِ سَيْنَاءَ. وَأمَّا قَوْلُهُ: وَأضَاءَ لَنَا مِنْ جَبَلِ سَاعِيرَ، فَهُوَ الجَبَلُ الَّذِي أوْحَى اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إلى عِيسَى بْنِ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِ. وَأمَّا قَوْلُهُ: وَاسْتَعْلَنَ عَلَيْنَا مِنْ جَبَلِ فَارَانَ، فَذَلِكَ جَبَلٌ مِنْ جِبَالِ مَكَّةَ، بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَهَا يَوْمٌ.وَقَالَ شَعْيَاءُ النَّبِيُّ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ فِي مَا تَقُولُ أنْتَ وَأصْحَابُكَ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ: رَأَيْتُ رَاكِبَيْنِ أضَاءَتْ لَهُمُ الأَرْضُ؛ أَحَدُهُمَا عَلَى حِمَارٍ وَالآخَرُ عَلَى جَمَلٍ. فَمَنْ رَاكِبُ الحِمَارِ وَمَنْ رَاكِبُ الجَمَلِ؟ قَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: لا أعْرِفُهُمَا، فَخَبِّرْنِي بِهِمَا. قَالَ: أمَّا رَاكِبُ الحِمَارِ فَعِيسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ، وَأمَّا رَاكِبُ الجَمَلِ فَمُحَمَّدٌ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ. أتُنْكِرُ هَذَا مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ؟ قَالَ: لا، مَا أُنْكِرُهُ. ثُمَّ قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: هَلْ تَعْرِفُ حَيْقُوقَ النَّبِيَّ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ؟قَالَ: نَعَمْ، إنّي بِهِ لَعَارِفٌ.قَالَ: فَإنَّهُ قَالَ، وَكِتَابُكُمْ يَنْطِقُ بِهِ: جَاءَ اللهُ تَعَالى بِالبَيَانِ مِنْ جَبَلِ فَارَانَ، وَامْتَلأَتِ السَّمَاوَاتُ مِنْ تَسْبِيحِ أحْمَدَ وَأُمَّتِهِ. يَحْمِلُ خَيْلَهُ فِي البَحْرِ كَمَا يَحْمِلُ فِي البَرِّ، يَأتِينَا بِكِتَابٍ جَدِيدٍ بَعْدَ خَرَابِ بَيْتِ المَقْدِسِ. يَعْنِي بِالكِتَابِ، الفُرْقَانَ. أتَعْرِفُ هَذَا وَتُؤْمِنُ بِهِ؟قَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: قَدْ قَالَ ذَلِكَ حَيْقُوقُ النَّبِيُّ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ، وَلا نُنْكِرُ قَوْلَهُ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: فَقَدْ قَالَ دَاوُودُ فِي زَبُورِهِ، وَأنْتَ تَقْرَأُهُ: اَللَّهُمَّ ابْعَثْ مُقِيمَ السُّنَّةِ بَعْدَ الفَتْرَةِ. فَهَلْ تَعْرِفُ نِبِيّاً أقَامَ السُّنَّةَ بَعْدَ الْفَتْرَةِ غَيْرَ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ؟قَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: هَذَا قَوْلُ دَاوُودَ نَعْرِفُهُ وَلا نُنْكِرُ، وَلكِنْ عَنِيَ بِذَلِكَ عِيسَى، وَأيَّامُهُ هِيَ الْفَتْرَةُ. قَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: جَهِلْتَ! إنَّ عِيسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ لَمْ يُخَالِفِ السُّنَّةَ، وَكَانَ مُوافِقاً لِسُنَّةِ التَّوْرَاةِ حَتّى رَفَعَهُ اللهُ إلَيْهِ. وَفِي الإنْجِيلِ مَكْتُوبٌ: إنَّ ابْنَ البَرَّةِ ذَاهِبٌ، وَالبَارْقَلِيطا جَاءَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ، وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَحْفَظُ الآصَارَ، وَيُفَسِّرُ لَكُمْ كُلَّ شَيءٍ، وَيَشْهَدُ لِي كَمَا شَهِدْتُ لَهُ. أنَا جِئْتُكُمْ بِالأمْثَالِ وَهُوَ يَأتِيكُمْ بِالتَّأوِيلِ. أَتُؤْمِنُ بِهَذا فِي الإنْجِيلِ؟قَالَ: نَعَمْ.فَقَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: يَا رَأسَ الجَالُوتِ، أسْأَلُكَ عَنْ نَبِيِّكَ مُوسَى بْنِ عِمْرَانَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ. فَقَالَ: سَلْ. قَالَ: مَا الحُجَّةُ عَلَى أنَّ مُوسَى ثَبُتَتْ نُبُوَّتُهُ؟قَالَ اليَهُودِيُّ: إنَّهُ جَاءَ بِمَا لَمْ يَجِئْ بِهِ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الأنْبِيَاءِ قَبْلَهُ.قَالَ لَهُ: مِثْلُ مَاذا؟قَالَ: مِثْلُ فَلْقِ البَحْرِ، وَقَلْبِهِ العَصَا حَيَّةً تَسْعَى، وَضَرْبِهِ الحَجَرَ فَانْفَجَرَتْ مِنْهُ العُيُونُ، وَإخْراجِهِ يَدَهُ بَيْضَاءَ لِلنّاظِرِينَ. وَعَلامَاتُهُ لاَ يَقْدِرُ الخَلْقُ عَلَى مِثْلِهَا.قَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: صَدَقْتَ فِي أنَّهُ كَانَتْ حُجَّتَهُ عَلَى نُبُوَّتِهِ أنَّهُ جَاءَ بِمَا لاَ يَقْدِرُ الخَلْقُ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ. أفَلَيْسَ كُلُّ مَنِ ادَّعَى أنَّهُ نَبِيٌّ ثُمَّ جَاءَ بِمَا لاَ يَقْدِرُ الخَلْقُ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ وَجَبَ عَلَيْكُمْ تَصْدِيقُهُ؟قَالَ: لاَ. لأنَّ مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ نَظِيرٌ، لِمَكَانِهِ مِنْ رَبِّهِ وَقُرْبِهِ مِنْهُ. وَلاَ يَجِبُ عَلَيْنَا الإقْرَارُ بِنُبُوَّةِ مَنِ ادَّعَاهَا حَتّى يَأتِيَ مِنَ الأعْلامِ بِمِثْلِ مَا جَاءَ بِهِ مَوسَى.فَقَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: فَكَيْفَ أقْرَرْتُمْ بِالأنْبِيَاءِ الَّذِينَ كَانوا قَبْلَ مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ وَلَمْيَفْلُقُوا البَحْرَ وَلَمْ يُفَجِّرُوا مِنَ الحَجَرِ اثْنَي عَشَرَةَ عَيْناً وَلَمْ يُخْرِجُوا أيْدِيَهُمْ مِثْلَ إخْرَاجِ مُوسَى يَدَهُ بَيْضَاءَ وَلَمْ يَقْلِبُوا العَصَا حَيَّةً تَسْعَى؟قَالَ اليَهُودِيُّ: قَدْ خَبَّرْتُكَ أنَّهُ مَتَى مَا جَاؤوا عَلَى نُبُوَّتِهِمْ مِنَ الآيَاتِ بِمَا لاَ يَقْدِرُ الخَلْقُ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ، وَلَوْ جَاؤوا بِمَا يَجِئُ بِهِ مُوسَى أوْ كَانَ عَلَى غَيْرِ مَا جَاءَ بِهِ مُوسَى وَجَبَ تَصْدِيقُهُمْ.قَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: يَا رَأسَ الجَالُوتِ، فَمَا يَمْنَعُكَ مِنَ الإقْرَارِ بِعِيسَى بْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَقَدْ كَانَ يُحْيِي المَوْتَى وَيُبْرِءُ الأَكْمَهَ وَالأَبْرَصَ وَيَخْلُقُ مِنَ الطِّينَ كَهَيْئَةِ الطَّيْرِ ثُمَّ يَنْفُخُ فِيهِ فَيَكُونُ طَيْراً بِإذْنِ اللهِ تَعَالى؟قَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: يُقَالُ إنَّهُ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ، وَلَمْ نَشْهَدْهُ!قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: أرَأَيْتَ مَا جَاءَ بِهِ مُوسَى مِنَ الآيَاتِ؟ أشَاهَدْتَهُ؟ ألَيْسَ إنَّمَا جَاءَتِ الأخْبَارُ مِنْ ثِقَاتِ أصْحَابِ مُوسَى أنَّهُ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالَ: بَلَى.قَالَ: فَكَذلِكَ أيْضاً. أتَتْكُمُ الأخْبَارُ المُتَوَاتِرَةُ بِمَا فَعَلَ عِيسَى بْنُ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ. فَكَيْفَ صَدَّقْتُمْ بِمُوسَى وَلَمْ تُصَدِّقوا بِعِيسَى؟فَلَمْ يَحْرَ جَواباً. قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: وَكَذلِكَ أمْرُ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَمَا جَاءَ بِهِ، وَأَمْرُ كُلِّ نَبِيٍّ بَعَثَهُ اللهُ. وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أنَّهُ كَانَ يَتِيماً فَقِيراً رَاعِياً أجِيراً، لَمْ يَتَعَلَّمْ كِتَاباً وَلَمْ يَخْتَلِفْ إلَى مُعَلِّمٍ. ثُمَّ جَاءَ بِالقُرْآنِ الَّذِي فِيهِ قَصَصُ الأنْبِيَاءِ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّلاَمُ وَأخْبَارُهُمْ حَرْفاً حَرْفاً، وَأخْبَارُ مَنْ مَضَى وَمَنْ بَقِيَ إلى يَوْمِ القِيَامَةِ. ثُمَّ كَانَ يُخْبِرُهُمْ بِأَسْرَارِهِمْ وَمَا يَعْمَلُونَ فِي بُيُوتِهِمْ، وَجَاءَ بِآيَاتٍ كَثِيرَةٍ لاَ تُحْصَى.قَالَ رَأسُ الجَالُوتِ: لَمْ يَصِحَّ عِنْدَنَا خَبَرُ عِيسَى وَلا خَبَرُ مُحَمَّدٍ (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ). وَلاَ يَجُوزُ لَنَا أنْ نُقِرَّ لَهُمَا بِمَا لاَ يَصِحُّ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: فَالشَّاهِدُ الَّذِي شَهِدَ لِعِيسَى وَلِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ شَاهِدُ زُورٍ! فَلَمْ يَحْرَ جَوَاباً. ثُمَّ دَعَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ بِالْهِرْبِذِ الأكْبَرِ، فَقَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: أخْبِرْنِي عَنْ زُرَدِهشْتَ الَّذِي تَزْعَمُ أنَّهُ نَبِيٌّ؛ مَا حُجَّتُكَ عَلَى نُبُوَّتِهِ؟قَالَ: إنَّهُ أتَى بِمَا لَمْ يَأتِنَا أَحَدٌ قَبْلَهُ وَلَمْ نَشْهَدْهُ، وَلكِنَّ الأخْبَارَ مِنْ أسْلاَفِنَا وَرَدَتْ عَلَيْنَا بِأنَّهُ أَحَلَّ لَنَا مَا لَمْ يُحِلَّهُ غَيْرُهُ فَاتَّبَعْنَاهُ. قَالَ: أفَلَيْسَ إنَّمَا أَتَتْكُمُ الأخْبَارُ فَاتَّبَعْتُمُوهُ؟قَالَ: بَلَى. قَالَ: فَكَذلِكَ سَائِرَ الأُمَمِ السَّالِفَةِ؛ أَتَتْهُمُ الأخْبَارُ بِمَا أتَى بِهِ النَّبِيُّونَ وَأتَى بِهِ مُوسَى وَعِيسَى وَمُحَمَّدُ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ. فَمَا عُذْرُكُمْ فِي تَرْكِ الإقْرَارِ لَهُمْ، إذْ كُنْتُمْ إنَّمَا أقْرَرْتُمْ بِزُرَدِهشِتَ مِنْ قِبَلِ الأَخْبَارِ المُتَوَاتِرَةِ بِأنَّهُ جَاءَ بِمَا لَمْ يَجِئْ بِهِ غَيْرُهُ؟فَانْقَطَعَ الْهِرْبِذُ مَكَانَهُ. فَقَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: يَا قَوْمُ، إنْ كَانَ فِيكُمْ أَحَدٌ يُخَالِفُ الإِسْلامَ وَأَرَادَ أَنْ يَسْأَلَ فَلْيَسْأَلْ غَيْرَ مُحْتَشِمٍ.فَقَامَ إِلَيْهِ عِمْرَانُ الصَّابِي، وَكَانَ وَاحِداً فِي الْمُتَكَلِّمِينَ فَقَالَ: يَا عَالِمَ النَّاسِ، لَوْ لا أَنَّكَ دَعَوْتَ إِلَى مَسْأَلَتِكَ لَمْ أُقْدِمْ عَلَيْكَ بِالْمَسَائِلِ، فَلَقَدْ دَخَلْتُ الْكُوفَةَ وَالْبَصْرَةَ وَالشَّامَ وَالْجَزِيرَةَ وَلَقِيتُ الْمُتَكَلِّمِينَ فَلَمْ أَقَعْ عَلَى أَحَدٍ يُثْبِتُ لِي وَاحِداً لَيْسَ غَيْرُهُ قَائِماً بِوَحْدَانِيَّتِهِ، أَفَتَأْذَنُ أَنْ أَسْأَلَكَ؟قَالَ الرِّضَا: إِنْ كَانَ فِي الْجَمَاعَةِ عِمْرَانُ الصَّابِي فَأَنْتَ هُوَ. قَالَ: أَنَا هُوَ.قَالَ: سَلْ يَا عِمْرَانُ، وَعَلَيْكَ بِالنَّصَفَةِ، وَإِيَّاكَ وَالْخَطَلَ وَالْجَوْرَ.فَقَالَ: وَاللَّهِ يَا سَيِّدِي مَا أُرِيدُ إِلا أَنْ تُثْبِتَ لِي شَيْئاً أَتَعَلَّقُ بِهِ فَلا أَجُوزُهُ. قَالَ: سَلْ عَمَّا بَدَا لَكَ. فَازْدَحَمَ النَّاسُ وَانْضَمَّ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ.فَقَالَ عِمْرَانُ الصَّابِيُّ: أخْبِرْنِي عَنِ الكَائِنِ الأَوَّلِ وَعَمَّا خَلَقَ.فَقَالَ لَهُ: سَأَلْتَ فَافْهَمْ. أمَّا الْوَاحِدُ فَلَمْ يَزَلْ وَاحِداً كَائِناً لاَ شَيءَ مَعَهُ بِلاَ حُدِودٍ وَأعْرَاضٍ،وَلاَ يَزَالُ كَذلِكَ، ثُمَّ خَلَقَ خَلْقاً مُبْتَدِعاً مُخْتَلِفاً بِأعْرَاضٍ وَحُدُودٍ مُخْتَلِفَةٍ، لاَ فِي شَيءٍ أقَامَهُ وَلاَ فِي شيءٍ حَدَّهُ وَلاَ عَلَى شَيءٍ حَذَاهُ وَمَثَّلَهُ لَهُ. فَجَعَلَ الْخَلْقَ مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ صَفْوَةً وَغَيْرَ صَفْوَةٍ وَاخْتِلاَفاً وَائْتِلاَفاً وَألْوَاناً وَذَوْقاً وَطَعْماً، لا لِحَاجَةٍ كَانَتْ مِنْهُ إلى ذَلِكَ وَلا لِفَضْلِ مَنْزِلَةٍ لَمْ يَبْلُغْهَا إلاَّ بِهِ، وَلا أرَى لِنَفْسِهِ فِيمَا خَلَقَ زِيَادَةً وَلا نُقْصَاناً. تَعْقِلُ هَذا يَا عِمْرَانُ؟قَالَ: نَعَمْ وَ اللهِ يَا سَيِّدِي.قَالَ: وَاعْلَمْ يَا عِمْرَانُ أنَّهُ لَوْ كَانَ خَلَقَ مَا خَلَقَ لِحَاجَةٍ لَمْ يَخْلُقْ إلاَّ مَنْ يَسْتَعِينُ بِهِ عَلَى حَاجَتِهِ، وَلَكَانَ يَنْبَغِي أنْ يَخْلُقَ أضْعَافَ مَا خَلَقَ لأَنَّ الأَعْوَانَ كُلَّمَا كَثُرُوا كَانَ صَاحِبُهُمْ أقْوَى. وَالحَاجَةُ يَا عِمْرَانُ لاَ يَسَعُهَا لأنَّهُ كَانَ لَمْ يُحْدِثْ مِنَ الخَلْقِ شَيْئاً إلاّ حَدَثَتْ بِهِ حَاجَةٌ أُخْرَى. وَلِذَلِكَ أقُولُ: لَمْ يَخْلُقِ الخَلْقَ لِحَاجَةٍ وَلكِنْ نَقَلَ بِالخَلْقِ الحَوَائِجَ بَعْضَهُمْ إلى بَعْضٍ، وَفَضَّلَ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ بِلاَ حَاجَةٍ مِنْهُ إلى فَضْلٍ وَلاَ نِقْمَةٍ مِنْهُ عَلَى مَنْ أذَلَّ. فَلِهذَا خَلَقَ.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي، هَلْ كَانَ الكَائِنُ مَعْلُوماً فِي نَفْسِهِ عِنْدَ نَفْسِهِ؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: إنَّما يَكُونُ المَعْلَمَةُ بِالشَّيءِ لِنَفْيِ خِلاَفِهِ وَلِيَكُونَ الشَّيءُ نَفْسُهُ بِمَا نُفِيَ عَنْهُ مَوْجُوداً، وَلَمْ يَكُنْ هُناكَ شَيءٌ يُخَالِفُهُ فَتَدْعُوهُ الحَاجَةُ إلى نَفْيِ ذَلِكَ الشَّيءِ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ بِتَحْدِيدِ مَا عَلِمَ مِنْهَا. أفَهِمْتَ يَا عِمْرَانُ؟قَالَ: نَعَمْ وَاللهِ. سَيِّدِي فَأخْبِرْنِي بِأيِّ شَيءٍ عَلِمَ مَا عَلِمَ. أبِضَمِيرٍ أمْ بِغَيْرِ ذَلِكَ؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: أرَأَيْتَ إذَا عَلِمَ بِضَمِيرٍ هَلْ يَجِدُ بُدّاً مِنْ أنْ يَجْعَلَ لِذَلِكَ الضَّمِيرِ حَدّاً تَنْتَهِي إلَيْهِ المَعْرِفَةُ؟ قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: لاَ بُدَّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: فَمَا ذَلِكَ الضَّمِيرُ؟ فَانْقَطَعَ وَلَمْ يَحْرَ جَوَاباً.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: لا بَأسَ إنْ سَأَلْتُكَ عَنِ الضَّمِيرِ نَفْسِهِ، تَعْرِفُهُ بِضَمِيرٍ آخَرَ؟ فَإنْ قُلْتَ نَعَمْ، أفْسَدْتَ عَلَيْكَ قَوْلَكَ وَدَعْوَاكَ يَا عِمْرَانُ. ألَيْسَ يَنْبَغِي أنْ تَعْلَمَ أنَّ الوَاحِدَ لَيْسَ يُوصَفُ بِضَمِيرٍ وَلَيْسَ يُقَالُ لَهُ أكْثَرَ مِنْ فِعْلٍ وَعَمَلٍ وَصُنْعٍ، وَلَيْسَ يُتَوَهَّمُ مِنْهُ مَذاهِبُ وَتَجْزِيَةٍ كَمَذَاهِبِ المَخْلُوقِينَ وَتَجْزِيَتِهِمْ؟ فَاعْقِلْ ذَلِكَ وَابْنِ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَلِمْتَ صَواباً.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي، ألاَ تُخْبِرُنِي حُدُودَ خَلْقِهِ كَيْفَ هِيَ؟ وَمَا مَعَانِيهَا؟ وَعَلَى كَمْ نَوْعٍ يَكُونُ؟قَالَ: قَدْ سَأَلْتَ فَاعْلَمْ أنَّ حُدُودَ خَلْقِهِ عَلَى سِتَّةِ أنْوَاعٍ: مَلْمُوسٍ وَمَوْزُونٍ وَمَنْظُورٍ إلَيْهِ وَمَا لاَ ذَوْقَ لَهُ وَهُوَ الرُّوحُ وَمِنْها مَنْظُورٌ إلَيْهِ وَلَيْسَ لَهُ وَزْنٌ وَلاَ لَمْسٌ وَلاَ حِسٌّ وَلاَ لَوْنٌ وَلاَ ذَوْقٌ وَالتَّقْدِيرُ وَالأعْرَاضُ وَالصُّوَرُ وَالطُّولُ وَالْعَرْضُ، وَمِنْهَا العَمَلُ وَالحَرَكَاتُ الَّتِي تَصْنَعُ الأشْيَاءَ وَتَعْمَلُهَا وَتُغَيِّرُهَا مِنْ حَالٍ إلى حَالٍ وَتَزِيدُهَا وَتُنْقِصُهَا. فَأمّا الأعْمَالُ وَالحَرَكَاتُ فَإنَّهَا تَنْطَلِقُ لأَنَّهُ لا وَقْتَ لَها أكْثَرَ مِنْ قَدْرِ مَا يُحْتَاجُ إلَيْهِ. فَإذَا فَرَغَ مِنَ الشَّيءِ انْطَلَقَ بِالحَرَكَةِ وَبَقِيَ الأَثَرُ وَيَجْرِي مَجْرَى الكَلاَمِ، يَذْهَبُ وَيَبْقَى أثَرُهُ.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي، ألاَ تُخْبِرُنِي عَنِ الخَالِقِ إذَا كَانَ وَاحِداً لاَ شَيءَ غَيْرَهُ وَلاَ شَيْءَ مَعَهُ؟ ألَيْسَ قَدْ تَغَيَّرَ بِخَلْقِهِ الخَلْقُ؟قَالَ لَهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: قَدِيمٌ لَمْ يَتَغَيَّرْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ بِخَلْقِهِ الخَلْقُ وَلكِنَّ الخَلْقَ يَتَغَيَّرُ بِتَغَيُّرِهِ.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي فَبِأَيِّ شَيْءٍ عَرَفْنَاهُ؟قَالَ: بِغَيْرِهِ.قَالَ: فَأيُّ شَيءٍ غَيْرُهُ؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: مَشِيَّتُهُ وَاسْمُهُ وَصِفَتُهُ وَمَا أشْبَهَ ذَلِكَ، وَكُلُّ ذَلِكَ مُحْدَثٌ مَخْلُوقٌ مُدَبَّرٌ.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي، فَأيُّ شَيءٍ هُوَ؟ قَالَ: هُوَ نُورٌ بِمَعْنَى أنَّهُ هَادٍ خَلْقَهُ مِنْ أهْلِ السَّمَاءِ وَأهْلِ الأرْضِ، وَلَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَى أكْثَرَ مِنْ تَوْحِيدِي إيَّاهُ.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي، ألَيْسَ قَدْ كَانَ سَاكِتاً قَبْلَ الخَلْقِ لاَ يَنْطِقُ ثُمَّ نَطَقَ؟ قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: لاَ يَكُونُ السُّكُوتُ إلاّ عَنْ نَطْقٍ قَبْلَهُ. وَالمَثَلُ فِي ذَلِكَ أنَّهُ لاَ يُقَالُ لِلسِّرَاجِ هُوَ سَاكِتٌ لاَ يَنْطِقُ، وَلا يُقَالُ إنَّ السِّرَاجَ لَيُضِيءُ فِيمَا يُرِيدُ أنْ يَفْعَلَ بِنَا لأَنَّ الضَّوْءَ مِنَ السِّرَاجِ لَيْسَ بِفِعْلٍ مِنْهُ وَلا كَوْنٍ، وَإنَّما هُوَ لَيْسَ شَيءٌ غَيْرُهُ فَلَمّا اسْتَضَاءَ لَنَا قُلْنَا قَدْ أضَاءَ لَنَا حَتّى اسْتَضَأْنَا بِهِ. فَبِهَذا تَسْتَبْصِرُ أمْرَكَ.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي، فَإنَّ الَّذِي كَانَ عِنْدِي أنَّ الكَائِنَ قَدْ تَغَيَّرَ فِي فِعْلِهِ عَنْ حَالِهِ بِخَلْقِهِ الخَلْقَ. قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: أحَلْتَ يَا عِمْرَانُ فِي قَوْلِكَ أنَّ الكَائِنَ يَتَغَيَّرُ فِي وَجْهٍ مِنَ الوُجُوهِ حَتّى يُصِيبَ الذَّاتَ مِنْهُ مَا يُغَيِّرُهُ. يَا عِمْرَانُ، هَلْ تَجِدُ النَّارَ تُغَيِّرُهَا تَغَيُّرُ نَفْسِهَا؟ وَهَلْ تَجِدُ الحَرَارَةَ تُحْرِقُ نَفْسَهَا؟ أوْ هَلْ رَأيْتَ بَصِيراً قَطُّ رَأى بَصَرَهُ؟قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: لَمْ أَرَ هَذَا إلاَّ أنْ تُخْبِرَنِي يَا سَيِّدِي أهُوَ فِي الخَلْقِ أمِ الخَلْقُ فِيهِ؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: أَجَلْ يَا عِمْرَانُ، لَيْسَ هُوَ فِي الخَلْقِ وَلاَ الخَلْقُ فِيهِ. تَعَالى عَنْ ذَلِكَ وَسَاءَ عِلْمُكَ مَا تَعْرِفُهُ، وَلاَ قُوَّةَ الاّ بِاللهِ. أخْبِرْنِي عَنِ المِرْآةِ أنْتَ فِيهَا أمْ هِيَ فِيكَ؟ فَإنْ كَانَ لَيْسَ وَاحِدٌ مِنْكُمَا فِي صَاحِبِهِ فَبِأَيِّ شَيْءٍ إسْتَدْلَلْتَ بِهَا عَلَى نَفْسِكَ يَا عِمْرَانُ؟قَالَ: بِضَوْءٍ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَهَا.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: هَلْ تَرَى مِنْ ذَلِكَ الضَّوْءِ فِي المِرْآةِ أكْثَرَ مِمّا تَرَاهُ فِي عَيْنِكَ؟قَالَ: نَعَمْ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: فَأَرِنَاهُ.فَلَمْ يَحْرَ جَوَابـاً. قَالَ: فَلا أرَى النُّورَ إلاّ وَقَدْ دَلَّكَ وَدَلَّ المِرْآةَ عَلَى أنْفُسِكُمَا مِنْ غَيْرِ أنْيَكُونَ فِي وَاحِدٍ مِنْكُمَا. وَلِهَذَا أمْثَالٌ كَثِيرَةٌ غَيْرُ هَذَا، لاَ يَجِدُ الجَاهِلُ فِيهَا مَقَالاً. وَللهِ المَثَلُ الأَعْلَى.ثُمَّ الْتَفَتَ إلى المَأمُونِ فَقَالَ: الصَّلاَةُ قَدْ حَضَرَتْ.فَقَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي، لا تَقْطَعْ عَلَيَّ مَسْأَلَتِي فَقَدْ رَقَّ قَلْبِي.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ: نُصَلِّي وَنَعُودُ.فَنَهَضَ، وَنَهَضَ الْمَأْمُونُ. فَصَلَّى الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ دَاخِلاً، وَصَلَّى النَّاسُ خَارِجاً خَلْفَ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ جَعْفَرٍ. ثُمَّ خَرَجَا فَعَادَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ إِلَى مَجْلِسِهِ وَدَعَا بِعِمْرَانَ فَقَالَ: سَلْ يَا عِمْرَانُ.قَالَ: يَا سَيِّدِي، ألاَ تُخْبِرُنِي عَنِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، هَلْ يُوَحَّدُ بِحَقِيقَةٍ أوْ يُوَحَّدُ بِوَصْفٍ؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: إنَّ اللهَ المُبْدِئَ الوَاحِدَ الكَائِنَ الأَوَّلَ لَمْ يَزَلْ وَاحِداً لاَ شَيْءَ مَعَهُ، فَرْداً لاَ ثَانِيَ مَعَهُ، لاَ مَعْلُوماً وَلاَ مَجْهُولاً، وَلا مُحْكَماً وَلا مُتَشَابِهاً، وَلا مَذْكُوراً وَلاَ مَنْسِيّاً، وَلا شَيْئاً يَقَعُ عَلَيْهِ اسْمُ شَيْءٍ مِنَ الأشْيَاءِ غَيْرِهِ، وَلا مِنْ وَقْتٍ كَانَ وَلا إلى وَقْتٍ يَكُونُ، وَلا بِشَيْءٍ قَامَ وَلا إلى شَيْءٍ يَقُومُ، وَلا إلى شَيْءٍ اِسْتَنَدَ وَلا فِي شَيْءٍ اِسْتَكَنَّ. وَذَلِكَ كُلُّهُ قَبْلَ الخَلْقِ إذْ لاَ شَيْءَ غَيْرُهُ، وَمَا أوْقَعْتُ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الكُلِّ فَهِيَ صِفَاتٌ مُحْدَثَةٌ وَتَرْجَمَةٌ يَفْهَمُ بِهَا مَنْ فَهِمَ.وَاعْلَمْ أنَّ الإبْدَاعَ وَالمَشِيئَةَ وَالإرَادَةَ مَعْنَاهَا وَاحِدٌ وَأسْمَاؤها ثَلاثَةٌ. وَكَانَ أوَّلَ إبْدَاعِهِ وَإرَادَتِهِ وَمَشِيَّتِهِ الحُرُوفُ الَّتِي جَعَلَهَا أصْلاً لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَدَلِيلاً عَلَى كُلِّ مَدْرَكٍ وَفَاصِلاً لِكُلِّ مُشْكِلٍ. وَبِتِلْكَ الحُرُوفِ تَفْرِيقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مِنِ اسْمٍ حَقٍّ وَبَاطِلٍ أوْ فِعْلٍ أوْ مَفْعُولٍ أوْ مَعْنىً أوْ غَيْرِ مَعْنى. وَعَلَيْهَا اجْتَمَعَتِ الأُمُورُ كُلُّهَا وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ لِلْحُرُوفِ فِي إبْدَاعِهِ لَهَا مَعْنًى غَيْـرَأنْفُسِهَا تَتَنَاهَى وَلا وُجُودَ لَهَا لأَنَّهَا مُبْدَعَةٌ بِالإبْدَاعِ. وَالنُّورُ فِي هَذَا المَوْضِعِ أوَّلُ فِعْلِ اللهِ الَّذِي هُوَ نُورُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأرْضِ، وَالْحُرُوفُ هِيَ الْمَفْعُولُ بِذَلِكَ الْفِعْلِ وَهِيَ الْحُرُوفُ الَّتِي عَلَيْهَا مَدَارُ الْكَلاَمِ، وَالْعِبَادَاتُ كُلُّهَا مِنَ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ عَلَّمَهَا خَلْقَهُ، وَهِيَ ثَلاَثَةٌ وَثَلاَثُونَ حَرْفاً؛ فَمِنْهَا ثَمَانِيَةٌ وَعِشْرُونَ حَرْفاً تَدُلُّ عَلَى لُغَاتِ الْعَرَبِيَّةِ وَمِنَ الثَّمَانِيَةِ وَالْعِشْرِينَ اثْنَانِ وَعِشْرُونَ حَرْفاً تَدُلُّ عَلَى لُغَاتِ السَّرْيَانِيَّةِ وَالعِبْرَانِيَّةِ، وَمِنْهَا خَمْسَةُ أحْرُفٍ مُتَحَرِّفَةٍ فِي سَائِرِ اللُّغَاتِ مِنَ العَجَمِ وَالأقَالِيمِ.وَاللُّغَاتُ كُلُّهَا هِيَ خَمْسَةُ أحْرُفٍ تَحَرَّفَتْ مِنَ الثَّمَانِيَةِ وَالعِشْرِينَ حَرْفاً مِنَ اللُّغَاتِ فَصَارَتِ الْحُرُوفُ ثَلاَثَةً وَثَلاَثِينَ حَرْفاً. فَأمّا الْخَمْسَةُ الْمُخْتَلِفَةُ فَـ: (ي) (ت) (ج) (ح) (خ) لاَ يَجُوزُ ذِكْرُهَا أكْثَرَ مِمَّا ذَكَرْنَاهُ. ثُمَّ جَعَلَ الْحُرُوفَ بَعْدَ إحْصَائِها وَإحْكَامِ عِدَّتِهَا فِعْلاً مِنْهُ، كَقَوْلِهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: ( كُنْ فَيَكُونُ) وَكُنْ مِنْهُ صُنِعَ وَمَا يَكُونُ بِهِ الْمَصْنُوعُ، فَالْخَلْقُ الأَوَّلُ مِنَ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ الإبْدَاعُ لاَ وَزْنٌ لَهُ وَلاَ حَرَكَةٌ وَلاَ سَمْعٌ وَلاَ لَوْنٌ وَلاَ حِسٌّ. وَالْخَلْقُ الثَّانِي الْحُرُوفُ لاَ وَزْنٌ لَهَا وَلاَ لَوْنٌ، وَهِيَ مَسْمُوعَةٌ مَوْصُوفَةٌ غَيْرُ مَنْظُورٍ إلَيْهَا. وَالْخَلْقُ الثَّالِثُ مَا كَانَ مِنَ الأنْوَاعِ كُلِّهَا مَحْسُوساً مَلْمُوساً ذَا ذَوْقٍ مَنْظُوراً إلَيْهِ.وَاللهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالى سَابِقٌ لِلإبْدَاعِ لأَنَّهُ لَيْسَ قَبْلَهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ شَيْءٌ وَلا كَانَ مَعَهُ شَيءٌ، وَالإبْدَاعُ سَابِقٌ لِلْحُرُوفِ وَالْحُرُوفُ لاَ تَدُلُّ عَلَى غَيْرِ نَفْسِهَا.قَالَ الْمَأمُونُ: وَكَيْفَ لاَ تَدُلُّ عَلَى غَيْرِ أنْفُسِهَا؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: لأَنَّ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالى لاَ يَجْمَعُ مِنْهَا شَيْئاً لِغَيْرِ مَعْنىً أبَداً؛ فَإذَا ألَّفَ مِنْهَا أحْرُفاً أرْبَعَةً أوْ خَمْسَةً أوْ سِتَّةً أوْ أكْثَرَ مِنْ ذَلِكَ أوْ أقَلَّ لَمْ يُؤَلِّفْهَا بِغَيْرِ مَعْنى وَلَمْ يَكُنْ إلاَّ لِمَعْنى مُحْدَثٍ لَمْ يَكُنْ قَبْلَ ذَلِكَ شَيءٌ.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: فَكَيْفَ لَنَا بِمَعْرِفَةِ ذَلِكَ؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: أمَّا الْمَعْرِفَةُ فَوَجْهُ ذَلِكَ وَبَيَانُهُ أنَّـكَ تَذْكُرُ الْحُرُوفَ إذَا لَمْ تُرِدْ بِهَـا غَيْرَ نَفْسِهَا ذَكَرْتَهَا فَرْداً فَقُلْتَ: (ألف) (باء) (تاء) (ثاء) (جيم) (حاء) (خاء)… حِتّى تَأتِيَ عَلَى آخِرِهَا فَلَمْ تَجِدْ لَهَا مَعْنَىً غَيْرَ أنْفُسِهَا، وَإذَا ألَّفْتَهَا وَجَمَعْتَ مِنْهَا أحْرُفاً وَجَعَلْتَها اسْماً وَصِفَةً لِمَعْنىً ما طَلَبْتَ وَوَجْهٍ مَا عَنَيْتَ، كَانَتْ دَلِيلَهُ عَلَى مَعَانِيهَا دَاعِيَةً إلى الْمَوْصُوفِ بِهَا. أفَهِمْتَهُ؟قَالَ: نَعَمْ.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: وَاعْلَمْ أنَّهُ لاَ يَكُونُ صِفَةٌ لِغَيْرِ مَوْصُوفٍ وَلا اسْمٌ لِغَيْرِ مَعْنى وَلا حَدٌّ لِغَيْرِ مَحْدُودٍ. وَالصِّفَاتُ وَالأسْمَاءُ كُلُّهَا تَدُلُّ عَلَى الْكَمَالِ وَالوُجُودِ، وَلا تَدُلُّ عَلَى الإحَاطَةِ كَمَا تَدُلُّ الحُدُودُ الَّتِي هِيَ التَّرْبِيعُ وَالتَّثْلِيثُ وَالتَّسْدِيسُ، لأنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ تُدْرَكُ مَعْرِفَتُهُ بِالصِّفَاتِ وَالأسْمَاءِ ولاَ تُدْرَكُ بِالتَّحْدِيدِ بِالطُّولِ وَالعَرْضِ وِالقِلَّةِ وَالكَثْرَةِ وَاللَّوْنِ وَالوَزْنِ وَمَا أشْبَهَ ذَلِكَ. وَلَيْسَ يَحِلُّ باللهِ تَقَدَّسَ شَيءٌ مِنْ ذَلِكَ حَتّى يَعْرِفَهُ خَلْقُهُ بِمَعْرِفَتِهِمْ أنْفُسَهُمْ بِالضَّرُورَةِ الَّتِي ذَكَرْنَا، وَلَكِنْ يُدَلُّ عَلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ بِصِفَاتِهِ وَيُدْرَكُ بِأسْمَائِهِ وَيُسْتَدَلُّ عَلَيْهِ بِخَلْقِهِ. لاَ يَحْتَاجُ فِي ذَلِكَ الطَّالِبُ الْمُرْتَادُ إلى رُؤيَةِ عَيْنٍ وَلا اسْتِماعِ أُذُنٍ وَلا لَمْسِ كَفٍّ وَلا إحَاطَةٍ بِقَلْبٍ؛ وَلَوْ كَانَتْ صِفَاتُهُ جَلَّ ثَنَاؤهُ لاَ تَدِلُّ عَلَيْهِ وَأسْمَاؤهُ لا تَدْعُو إلَيْهِ وَالْمَعْلَمَةُ مِنَ الخَلْقِ لاَ تُدْرِكُهُ لِمَعْنَاهُ، كَانَتِ العِبَادَةُ مِنَ الخَلْقِ لأسْمَائِهِ وَصِفَاتِهِ دُونَ مَعْنَاهُ. فَلَوْلا أنَّ ذَلِكَ كَذَلِكَ لَكَانَ الْمَعْبُودُ الْم��وَحَّدُ غَيْرَ اللهِ، لأنَّ صَفَاتِهِ وَأسْمَائَهُ غَيْرُهُ. أفَهِمْتَ؟قَالَ: نَعَمْ يَا سَيِّدِي، زِدْنِي.قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: إيَّاكَ وَقَوْلَ الجُهَّالِ مِنْ أهْلِ العَمَى وَالضَّلالِ الَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أنَّ اللهَ جَلَّ وَتَقَدَّسَ مَوْجُودٌ فِي الآخِرَةِ لِلْحِسَابِ فِي الثَّوَابِ وَالعِقَابِ، وَلَيْسَ بِمَوْجُودٍ فِي الدُّنْيَا لِلطَّاعَةِ وَالرَّجَاءِ! وَلَوْ كَانَ فِي الوُجُودِ للهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ نَقْصٌ وَاهْتِضَامٌ لَمْ يُوجَدْ فِي الآخِـرَةِأبَداً. وَلكِنَّ القَوْمَ تَاهوا وَعَمُوا وَصَمُّوا عَنِ الحَقِّ مِنْ حَيْثُ لا يَعْلَمُونَ. وَقَوْلُهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: (وَمَنْ كَانَ فِي هَذِهِ أعْمَى فَهُوَ فِي الآخِرَةِ أعْمَى وَأضَلُّ سَبِيلاً) يَعْني أعْمَى عَنِ الحَقَائِقِ الْمَوْجُودَةِ. وَقَدْ عَلِمَ ذَووا الألْبَابِ أنَّ الاسْتِدْلالَ عَلَى مَا هُنَاكَ لاَ يَكُونُ إلاَّ بِمَا هَا هُنَا، وَمَنْ أخَذَ عِلْمَ ذَلِكَ بِرَأيِهِ وَطَلَبَ وُجُودَهُ وَإدْراكَهُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ دُونَ غَيْرِهَا لَمْ يَزْدَدْ مِنْ عِلْمِ ذَلِكَ إلاَّ بُعْداً، لأنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ جَعَلَ عِلْمَ ذَلِكَ خَاصَّةً عِنْدَ قَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ وَيَعْلَمُونَ وَيَفْهَمُونَ.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي، ألاَ تُخْبِرُنِي عَنِ الإبْدَاعِ، أخَلْقٌ هُوَ أمْ غَيْرُ خَلْقٍ؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: بَلْ خَلْقٌ سَاكِنٌ لاَ يُدْرَكُ بِالسُّكُونِ، وَإنَّمَا صَارَ خَلْقاً لأنَّهُ شَيءٌ مُحْدَثٌ، وَاللهُ تَعَالى الَّذِي أحْدَثَهُ فَصَارَ خَلْقاً لَهُ. وَإنَّما هُوَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَخَلْقُهُ لاَ ثَالِثَ بَيْنَهُمَا وَلاَ ثَالِثَ غَيْرَهُمَا. فَمَا خَلَقَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لَمْ يَعْدُ أنْ يَكُونَ خَلْقَهُ وَيَكُونَ الخَلْقُ سَاكِناً وَمُتَحَرِّكاً وَمُخْتَلِفاً وَمُؤْتَلِفاً وَمَعْلُوماً وَمُتَشَابِهاً، وَكُلُّ مَا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِ حَدٌّ فَهُوَ خَلْقُ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ.وَاعْلَمْ أنَّ كُلَّ مَا أوْجَدَتْكَ الحَوَاسُّ فَهُوَ مَعْنىً مُدْرِكٌ لِلْحَوَاسِّ، وَكُلُّ حَاسَّةٍ تَدُلُّ عَلَى مَا جَعَلَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لَها فِي إدْرَاكِهَا وَالفَهْمِ مِنَ القَلْبِ بِجَمِيعِ ذَلِكَ كُلِّهِ. وَاعْلَمْ أنَّ الوَاحِدَ الَّذِي هُوَ قَائِمٌ بِغَيْرِ تَقْدِيرٍ وَلاَ تَحْدِيدٍ خَلَقَ خَلْقاً مُقَدَّراً بِتَحْدِيدٍ وَتَقْدِيرٍ، وَكَانَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ خَلْقَيْنِ اثْنَيْنِ: التَّقْدِيرَ وَالمُقَدَّرَ، وَلَيْسَ فِي كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمَا لَوْنٌ وَلاَ وَزْنٌ وَلاَ ذَوْقٌ، فَجَعَلَ أحَدَهُمَا يُدْرَكُ بِالآخَرِ وَجَعَلَهُمَا مُدْرِكَيْنِ بِنَفْسِهِمَا وَلَمْ يَخْلُقْ شَيْئاً فَرْداً قَائِماً بِنَفْسِهِ دُونَ غَيْرِهِ لِلَّذِي أرَادَ مِنَ الدَّلالَةِ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ وَإثْبَاتِ وُجُودِهِ.فَاللهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالى فَرْدٌ وَاحِدٌ لاَ ثَانِيَ مَعَهُ يُقَيِّمُهُ وَلا يَعْضُدُهُ وَلا يُكِنُّهُ، وَالخَلْقُ يُمْسِكُ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضاً بِإذْنِ اللهِ تَعَالى وَمَشِيئَتِهِ، وَإنَّمَا اخْتَلَفَ النَّاسُ فِي هَذا البَابِ حَتّى تَاهوا وَتَحَيَّرُوا وَطَلَبُوا الخَلاصَ مِنَ الظُّلْمَةِ بِالظُّلْمَةِ فِي وَصْفِهِمُ اللهَ تَعَالى بِصِفَةِ أنْفُسِهِمْ فَازْدادُوا مِنَ الحَقِّ بُعْداً. وَلَوْ وَصَفُوا اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ بِصِفَاتِهِ وَوَصَفُوا الْمَخْلُوقِينَ بِصِفَاتِهِمْ لَقَالُوا بِالْفَهْمِ وَالْيَقِينِ وَلَمَا اخْتَلَفُوا. فَلَمَّا طَلَبُوا مِنْ ذَلِكَ مَا تَحَيَّرُوا فِيهِ ارْتَكَبُوا. وَاللهُ يَهْدِي مَنْ يَشَاءُ إلى صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ.قَالَ عِمْرَانُ: يَا سَيِّدِي، أشْهَدُ أنَّهُ كَمَا وَصَفْتَ، وَلَكِنْ بَقِيَتْ لِي مَسْأَلَةٌ.قَالَ: سَلْ عَمّا أرَدْتَ.قَالَ: أسْألُكَ عَنِ الحَكِيمِ؛ فِي أيِّ شَيْءٍ هُوَ؟ وَهَلْ يُحِيطُ بِهِ شَيْءٌ؟ وَهَلْ يَتَحَوَّلُ مِنْ شَيءٍ إلى شَيءٍ؟ أوْ بِهِ حَاجَةٌ إلى شَيءٍ؟قَالَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلاَمُ: أُخْبِرُكَ يَا عِمْرَانُ فَاعْقِلْ مَا سَأَلْتَ عَنْهُ، فَإنَّهُ مِنْ أغْمَضِ مَا يَرِدُ عَلَى الخَلْقِ فِي مَسَائِلِهِمْ، وَلَيْسَ يَفْهَمُ المُتَفَاوِتُ عَقْلُهُ العَازِبُ حِلْمُهُ وَلا يَعْجَزُ عَنْ فَهْمِهِ أولُوا العَقْلِ المُنْصِفُونَ. أمَّا تَأوِيلُ ذَلِكَ فَلَوْ كَانَ خَلَقَ مَا خَلَقَ لِحَاجَةٍ مِنْهُ لَجَازَ لِقَائِلٍ أنْ يَقُولَ يَتَحَوَّلُ إلى مَا خَلَقَ لِحَاجَتِهِ إلى ذَلِكَ؛ وَلَكِنَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لَمْ يَخْلُقْ شَيْئاً لِحَاجَةٍ وَلَمْ يَزَلْ ثَابِتاً لاَ في شَيءٍ وَلا عَلَى شَيءٍ.إنَّ الخَلْقَ يُمْسِكُ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضاً وَيَدْخُلُ بَعْضُهُ في بَعْضٍ وَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ، وَاللهُ جَلَّ وَتَقَدَّسَ بِقُدْرَتِهِ يُمْسِكُ ذَلِكَ كُلِّهِ وَلَيْسَ يَدْخُلُ في شَيءٍ وَلا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ وَلا يَؤُودُهُ حِفْظُهُ وَلا يَعْجَزُ عَنْ إمْسَاكِهِ وَلا يَعْرِفُ أحَدٌ مِنَ الخَلْقِ كَيْفَ ذَلِكَ إلاَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَمَنْ أطْـلَعَهُ عَلَيْهِ مِـنْرُسُلِهِ وَأهْلِ سِرِّهِ وَالمُسْتَحْفَظِينَ لأمْرِهِ وَخُزَّانِهِ القَائِمِينَ بِشَرِيعَتِهِ.وَإنَّمَا أمْرُهُ كَلَمْحِ البَصَرِ أوْ هُوَ أقْرَبُ. إذَا شَاءَ شَيْئاً فَإنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ (كُنْ فَيَكُونُ) بِمَشِيئَتِهِ وَإرَادَتِهِ. وَلا شَيْءَ مِنْ خَلْقِهِ أقْرَبُ إلَيْهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ وَلا شَيْءَ أبْعَدُ مِنْهُ مِنْ شَيْءٍ. أَفَهِمْتَ يَا عِمْرَانُ؟قَالَ نَعَمْ يَا سَيِّدِي، قَدْ فَهِمْتُ. وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى مَا وَصَفْتَ وَوَحَّدْتَ، وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ الْمَبْعُوثُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ.ثُمَّ خَرَّ سَاجِداً نَحْوَالْقِبْلَةِ وَأَسْلَمَ.قَالَ الْحَسَنُ بْنُ مُحَمَّدٍ النَّوْفَلِيُّ: فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ الْمُتَكَلِّمُونَ إِلَى كَلامِ عِمْرَانَ الصَّابِي، وَكَانَ جَدِلاً لَمْ يَقْطَعْهُ عَنْ حُجَّتِهِ أَحَدٌ قَطُّ، لَمْ يَدْنُ مِنَ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ أَحَدٌ مِنْهُمْ وَلَمْ يَسْأَلُوهُ عَنْ شَيْ‏ءٍ. وَأَمْسَيْنَا فَنَهَضَ الْمَأْمُونُ وَالرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ فَدَخَلا وَانْصَرَفَ النَّاسُ.وَكُنْتُ مَعَ جَمَاعَةٍ مِنْ أَصْحَابِنَا إِذْ بَعَثَ إِلَيَّ مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ جَعْفَرٍ فَأَتَيْتُهُ فَقَالَ لِي: يَا نَوْفَلِيُّ أَمَا رَأَيْتَ مَا جَاءَ بِهِ صَدِيقُكَ لا وَاللَّهِ مَا ظَنَنْتُ أَنَّ عَلِيَّ بْنَ مُوسَى خَاضَ فِي شَيْ‏ءٍ مِنْ هَذَا قَطُّ وَلا عَرَفْنَاهُ بِهِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْمَدِينَةِ أَوْ يَجْتَمِعُ إِلَيْهِ أَصْحَابُ الْكَلامِ قُلْتُ قَدْ كَانَ الْحَاجُّ يَأْتُونَهُ فَيَسْأَلُونَهُ عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ مِنْ حَلالِهِمْ وَحَرَامِهِمْ فَيُجِيبُهُمْ وَرُبَّمَا كَلَّمَ مَنْ يَأْتِيهِ يُحَاجُّهُ فَقَالَ: مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ جَعْفَرٍ يَا بَا مُحَمَّدٍ إِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْهِ أَنْ يَحْسُدَهُ هَذَا الرَّجُلُ فَيَسُمَّهُ أَوْ يَفْعَلَ بِهِ بَلِيَّةً فَأَشِرْ عَلَيْهِ بِالإِمْسَاكِ عَنْ هَذِهِ الأَشْيَاءِ قُلْتُ إِذاً لا يَقْبَلُ مِنِّي وَمَا أَرَادَ الرَّجُلُ إِلا امْتِحَانَهُ لِيَعْلَمَ هَلْ عِنْدَهُ شَيْ‏ءٌ مِنْ عُلُومِ آبَائِهِ‏ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ فَقَالَ لِي: قُلْ لَهُ: إِنَّ عَمَّكَ قَدْ كَرِهَ هَذَا الْبَابَ وَأَحَبَّ أَنْ تُمْسِكَ عَنْ هَذِهِ الأَشْيَاءِ لِخِصَالٍ شَتَّى فَلَمَّا انْقَلَبْتُ إِلَى مَنْزِلِ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ أَخْبَرْتُهُ بِمَا كَانَ مِنْ عَمِّهِ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ جَعْفَرٍ فَتَبَسَّمَ‏ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ ثُمَّقَالَ حَفِظَ اللَّهُ عَمِّي مَا أَعْرَفَنِي بِهِ لِمَ كَرِهَ ذَلِكَ يَا غُلامُ صِرْ إِلَى عِمْرَانَ الصَّابِي فَأْتِنِي بِهِ فَقُلْتُ جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ أَنَا أَعْرِفُ مَوْضِعَهُ وَهُوَعِنْدَ بَعْضِ إِخْوَانِنَا مِنَ الشِّيعَةِ قَالَ فَلا بَأْسَ قَرِّبُوا إِلَيْهِ دَابَّةً فَصِرْتُ إِلَى عِمْرَانَ فَأَتَيْتُهُ بِهِ فَرَحَّبَ بِهِ وَدَعَا بِكِسْوَةٍ فَخَلَعَهَا عَلَيْهِ وَحَمَلَهُ وَدَعَا بِعَشَرَةِ آلافِ دِرْهَمٍ فَوَصَلَهُ بِهَا فَقُلْتُ جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ حَكَيْتَ فِعْلَ جَدِّكَ أَمِيرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ‏ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ قَالَ هَكَذَا يَجِبُ ثُمَّ دَعَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ بِالْعِشَاءِ فَأَجْلَسَنِي عَنْ يَمِينِهِ وَأَجْلَسَ عِمْرَانَ عَنْ يَسَارِهِ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرَغْنَا قَالَ لِعِمْرَانَ انْصَرِفْ مُصَاحِباً وَبَكِّرْ عَلَيْنَا نُطْعِمْكَ طَعَامَ الْمَدِينَةِ فَكَانَ عِمْرَانُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ يَجْتَمِعُ إِلَيْهِ الْمُتَكَلِّمُونَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْمَقَالاتِ فَيُبْطِلُ أَمْرَهُمْ حَتَّى اجْتَنَبُوهُ وَوَصَلَهُ الْمَأْمُونُ بِعَشَرَةِ آلافِ دِرْهَمٍ وَأَعْطَاهُ الْفَضْلُ مَالاً وَحَمَلَهُ وَوَلاهُ الرِّضَا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ صَدَقَاتِ بَلْخٍ فَأَصَابَ الرَّغَائِب‏.",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "12-1 Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Ahmad al-Ilaqi - the jurisprudent from Qum - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Abu Muhammad Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Sadaqa al-Qumi quoted on the authority of Abu Amro ibn Muhammad ibn Umar ibn Abdul Aziz Al-Ansari al-Kajji, on the authority of Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Nowafali al-Hashemi,",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "When Ali ibn Musa Al-Ridha (s) went to see Al-Ma’mun, Al-Ma’mun ordered Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl to summon the prominent theologians from among the rhetoricians and the religions such as al-Jaseliq (the Catholic Archbishop), the High Rabbi, the Hindu High Priest, followers of Zoroaster, Nestus the Roman medical scientist, and the rest of thetheologians in order to hear their words, and those of Al-Ridha (s). Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl gathered them together (in Al-Ma’mun’s palace), and then he informed Al-Ma’mun about the meeting. Al-Ma’mun granted them permission to enter and received them with hospitality and honor.Then he presented before them what he intended to do by saying, “I have gathered you for (something) good and want you to have a debate with my cousin from Medina, who will come to me. Come to me tomorrow morning. None of you should be absent.”They said, “O Commander of the Faithful! We listen and obey you. God willing, we will be here first thing in the morning.”Al-Nawfali said, “We were talking to Abil Hassan (s) when Yasir - the servant who was in charge of serving Abil Hassan (s) entered and told him, “O my master! Indeed the Commander of the Faithful expressed his greetings to you and said, May your brother be your ransom! Indeed the chief scientists, scholars from all religions and masters of speech from all nations have all gathered together here with me. Would you like to come to us and have a discussion with them? If you do not wish to do so, do not bother yourself. Even if you prefer, we do not mind coming to you. Then Abul Hassan said, “Express my greetings to him and tell him that I understand what you mean. God willing, I will come to you myself tomorrow morning.”Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said, ‘When Yasir went out, the Imam (s) turned to me and said, ‘O Nawfali! You are an Iraqi, and an Iraqi’s heart is not hard. So, what do think is your cousin’s intention in setting up a meeting between me and the pagans and scholars?”Al-Nawfali answered, “May I be your ransom! He wants to test you, and wants to know how much knowledge you possess. He has, indeed, based his assumption on shaky grounds. By God, what he has set up is dangerous.”The Imam (s) asked, “And what has he set up?”Al-Nawfali said, “The theologians and the heretics are different from the scholars. That is because a scholar does not deny the undeniable, whereas rhetoricians, theologians, and polytheists are people who deny things and try to prove what is not true. If you argue with them and tell them that God is One, they would say, ’Prove His Oneness’, and if yousay that Muhammad (s) is the Messenger of God, they would say, ’Prove his Prophethood.’ May I be your ransom! They confuse you and make you disprove your own proofs. They continue these false accusations until you back off.”Al-Nawfali added, “Then the Imam (s) smiled and told me, ‘O Al-Nawfali! Do you fear that they will disprove my argument?’”Al-Nawfali said, ‘No, by God! I have never worried about you, and I hope that God willing, God will make you victorious over them!’The Imam (s) asked again, ‘O Nawfali! Would you like to know when Al-Ma’mun will feel regretful?’ He answered, ‘Yes.’ The Imam (s) said, ‘When he (al-Ma’mun) hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own Torah, with the people of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel, with the people of the Psalms quoting their own Psalms, with the Zoroastrians arguing in their Persian language, with the Romans in their own Latin, and with the rhetoricians using their very own rhetoric. So, if I close the avenues of argument in the face of each arguing party and disprove his claim, making him renounce his statement from its onset and referring to my own statement, then Al-Ma’mun will realize that he has not achieve what he aspires to achieve. It is then that he will feel regretful. And there is no strength save in the Highest, the Almighty God.’”On the following day, Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl went in a hurry to see the Imam (s) and told him, “May I be your ransom! Your cousin is waiting for you. The people have gathered together. When will you go to him?”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “You go ahead. God willing, I will come to you.” Then he (s) made ablutions for praying, drank something, ate some soup with us and we all left. Then we reached Al-Ma’mun’s palace. The meeting was full of people. Muhammad ibn Ja’far, some of the Talibites and the Hashemites, and the Commanders of the Army were amongst those present.When Al-Ridha (s) entered, Al-Ma’mun stood up. Muhammad ibn Ja’far and all the Hashemites who were present there stood up for him. The Imam and Al-Ma’mun sat down while all the people were still standing, until Al-Ma’mun ordered them to sit down. Al-Ma’mun talked to the Imam (s) for a while. Then Al-Ma’mun turned to the CatholicArchbishop and said, “O Catholic Archbishop! This is my cousin Ali ibn Musa ibn Ja’far (s). He is one of the children of (the Blessed Lady) Fatima (s) - the daughter of our Prophet (s) - and Ali ibn Abi Talib (s). I would like you to have a debate with him and be fair with him.The Catholic Archbishop said, “O Commander of the Faithful! How can I argue with a man who argues with me using a Book which we have denied and a Prophet whom I do not believe in?”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “O Christian! Will you accept it if I present proofs from your Gospel?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “How could I reject what the Bible speaks about? I swear to God that I will accept it even if I dislike it.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “Ask whatever you wish to ask and receive your answer.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “What is your opinion about the Prophethood of Jesus (s) and his Book? Do you deny either one of them?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “I admit to the Prophethood of Jesus (s), his Book, and what he advised his nation to do- which his disciples accepted. However, I reject the Prophethood of any Jesus who has not professed the Prophethood of Muhammad, his Book and what he (s) advised his nation to do.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “Aren’t precepts proved through two just witnesses?”The Imam (s) said, “Yes.” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Therefore, name two witnesses other than the people of your own nation and ones whom Christianity does not reject to testify to the Prophethood of Muhammad. Likewise, ask us a similar thing from people other than our own nation.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Christian! Now you are speaking fairly. Do you accept a just person who was given preference (over others) by the Messiah - Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “Who is the just one? Name him for me.”The Imam (s) said, “What is your opinion of John al-Daylami?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “Bravo! Bravo!” You have mentioned the person loved the most by the Messiah.”The Imam (s) said, “Then I ask you to swear to and tell me whether or not the Bible says that John says, ‘The Messiah has informed me of the religion of Muhammad, the Arab, and has given me the glad tidings about him who will be (a Prophet) after him. Therefore, I gave the glad tidings of him to the disciples and they believed in him.’”The Catholic Archbishop said, “John did quote this from the Messiah. He did give the glad tidings of a man who will be a Prophet, his Household and his Trustees. He has not clarified when this will happen and has not named them so that we may know who they are.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “If we bring someone here who can recite the Bible and he recites to you Muhammad’s name, his Household, and his nation, will you believe in him?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “What a sound suggestion!”Al-Ridha (s) turned to Nestus the Roman and asked him, “Have you memorized the third Book of the Bible?”He answered, “I have thoroughly memorized it.” Then the Imam (s) addressed the Catholic Archbishop and said, “Can you recite the Bible?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Yes, of course.”The Imam (s) said, “Then I will recite to you (some verses from) the third Book. If Muhammad (s), his Household, and his nation were mentioned in it, then bear witness! And if they have not been mentioned therein, then do not bear witness.” Then the Imam (s) recited to him some of the verses of the third Book until he (s) reached the reference to the Prophet (s). He stopped reading and said, “O Christian! I challenge you to swear by the Messiah and his mother. Have you realized that I have knowledge of the Bible?” He replied, “Yes.”The Imam recited to him some verses from the third Book concerning the reference to the Prophet, his Household and his community. Then the Imam (s) said, “O Christian! What do you think now? These are the words of Jesus: the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s). If you deny what the Bible says, then you will deny Moses (s) and Jesus (s). If you deny them, then it is incumbent (upon the people) to kill you since you have blasphemed against your Lord, your Prophet and your Book.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “I do not deny the clear things in the Bible, rather I profess them.”The Imam (s) asked others who were present, “Bear witness that he professed.”Then the Imam (s) told the Catholic Archbishop, “O Catholic Archbishop! Ask me any other questions that you wish to ask.”The Catholic Archbishop asked, “What about the disciples of Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s)? How many were they? And tell me about the scholars of the Bible. How many were they?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “You have found the expert! As for (the number of) the disciples, they were twelve men. The best and the most learned of them was Aluqas (Luke). As for (the number of) Christian scholars, there were three men: John (Yohanna), ‘the greatest’, John at Qriqisiya, and John - the al-Daylami at Zijar, who made reference to the Prophet Muhammad (s). It is he who gave the good news to the nation of Jesus and the Children of Israel about the Prophet Muhammd.”The Imam (s) added, “O Christian! By God, we believe in the Jesus who believed in Muhammad (s). We have nothing against Jesus (s) except for his weakness and the paucity of his fasting and prayer.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “By God, you have corrupted your knowledge! Your affair has become weak! I thought that you were the most learned of the Muslims!”Al-Ridha (s) asked, “Why?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Since you said that Jesus was weak with little fasting and praying, while Jesus never broke fasting by day and never slept at night. He always fasted during the day and prayed at night.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “For whom did he fast and pray?” The Catholic Archbishop did not answer, not knowing what to say.Al-Ridha (s) said, “I want to ask you a question.” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Ask. I will respond to you if I know the answer.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Why do you deny that Jesus (s) gave life to the dead with the Honorable the Exalted God’s permission?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “I denied that before, since whoever giveslife to the dead and heals the blind and the leprous is a lord worthy of being worshipped.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Well. Indeed al-Yasa (Elija) did just as Jesus (s) did. He walked on water, gave life to the dead, and healed the blind and the leprous. Why did his nation not adopt him as a Lord? Why did not anyone worship him as a god other than God?”The Prophet Hezqeel (Ezekiel) (s) did just what Jesus (s) did. He gave life to thirty-five men sixty years after their death.” Then the Imam (s) turned towards the Catholic Archbishop and told him, “O Catholic Archbishop! Have you found the following about some of the youth of the Children of Israel in the Torah? When Bukht Nasr (Nebuchadnezzar) invaded Jerusalem, he chose from amongst the Children of Israel who were enslaved and took them with him to go to Babylon. Then the Honorable the Exalted God dispatched al-Yasa’ for them and he gave life to them. This (statement) is in the Torah. No one but an atheist would deny it.”The Catholic Archbishop said, “I have heard about this and know it.” The Imam (s) said, “That is right.”Then the Imam (s) said, “O Jew! See if I read the following Book of the Torah properly.” The Imam (s) then recited some of the verses from the Torah for us. The Jew who was surprised hearing how the Imam (s) was reciting the Torah kept moving his body. He then faced the Christian and asked, “O Christian! Were these before Jesus (s) or was Jesus (s) before them?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “They were before him.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “(People from) the Quraysh (tribe) gathered around God’s Messenger Muhammad (s) and asked him to give life to their dead. He (s) sent along Ali ibn Abi Talib with them and told him, “Go to the cemetery and loudly call the people about whom they have asked, Say, “O so-and-so, so-and-so, etc.” Tell them, “God’s Messenger Muhammad (s) says, ‘Rise with the permission of the Honorable the Exalted God!’ Then they will all arise and brush off the dust from their heads.” The people from the Quraysh tribe walked towards them and asked them about their affairs. They told them that Muhammad was appointed as a Prophet. The people who had risen from the dead said, “We wish we had lived in his age and believed in him!” The Prophet healed the blind, the leprous and the insane. He spoke with the beasts, the birds, the jinn,and Satan. Still, we do not adopt him as a Lord other than God. We do not deny the nobilities of any of these Prophets. But you who have adopted Jesus (s) as a Lord, so then is it permissible for you to adopt al-Yasa and Hizqeel as two Lords, for they did just as Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s) did - acts such as giving life to the dead and else?Moreover, thousands of the Children of Israel left their homeland in fear of death due to plague. God made them die immediately. The people of the village built a fence around them, and left them there until their bones decayed. One of the Prophets of the Children of Israel passed by. He was amazed when he saw many decayed bones. The Honorable the Exalted God revealed to him, “Would you like Me to bring them to life so that you can admonish them?” The Prophet (s) said, “Yes, Lord!” Then the Honorable the Exalted God revealed to him, “Then call them.” He said, “O decayed bones! Rise with God’s permission.” They all rose while brushing off the dust from their heads.”Also Abraham - the friend of God the Merciful (s) - took the birds, cut them into pieces, and put each piece on a mountain top. He called out to them and they came towards him. Moses the son of Imran (s) and seventy of his companions whom he had chosen went to the mountain. They told Moses (s), “You have seen God, then show Him to us.” Moses (s) told them, “I have not seen Him.” But they said, ‘…We shall never believe in thee until we see Allah manifestly…’ A thunderbolt struck them, and burnt them all up. Only Moses (s) survived. Moses (s) said, “O my Lord! I chose seventy men from among the Children of Israel and brought them to the mountain. Shall I return by myself? How shall my people believe what I must tell them? ‘If it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? ’ ’’Then the Honorable the Exalted God gave life to them after their death. You cannot deny all these things which I have told you, for the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms of David and the Quran have mentioned them. If all those who gave life to the dead, healed the blind, the leprous and the mad were adopted as Lords other than God, then you should also adopt them as Lords. O Christian! What is your opinion?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “Yes. You are right. There is no god but God.”Then the Imam (s) turned towards the High Rabbi and told him, “O Jew! Turn to me. I swear to you by the Ten Commandments which were sent down to Moses (the son of Imran) to tell me whether or not there exists the following statement about the Prophet Muhammad and his nation in the Torah, “When the people of the last nation whose followers are the Rider of the Camel who extremely glorifies the Lord - new glorifications in new churches (implying mosques), then let the Children of Israel flee towards them and their dominion so that their hearts may be tranquil, since there will be swords in their hands with which they will take revenge on the unbelievers around the globe.” Is this not written in the Torah?” The High Rabbi said, “Yes, we have found that written in this manner.”Then the Imam (s) asked the Catholic Archbishop, “O Christian! How is your knowledge of the Book of Sha’ya?” He answered, “I know it letter by letter.” Then the Imam (s) asked them both, “Do you know that the following statement is made by him?, ‘O people! I have seen the picture of the Rider of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel - who is as bright as the moon.’” They answered, “Indeed Sha’ya did say that!”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Christian! Do you know that Jesus (s) said, ‘I am going to my Lord and your Lord, and the Paraclete is coming who shall testify to my truth just as I testified for him, and he shall explain everything to you, and he shall be the one to expose all the sins of nations, and he shall be the one to smash down the pillars of unbelief?’” The Catholic Archbishop said, “We accept whatever you cite from the Bible.” The Imam (s) said, “O Catholic Archbishop! Have you found this established in the Bible?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “Yes.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Catholic Archbishop! When you lost the first Bible, with whom did you find it?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “We only lost the Bible for one day. Then we found it fresh (in its original state). John and Matthew brought it back to us.”Al-Ridha (s) asked him, “How little your knowledge of the Bible and its scholars is! If what you say is right, then why is there so much dispute amongst you with each other about the Bible? The reason is that there iscontroversy lies in the Bible which is in your hands today. Had it been the same as the first Bible, there would no disputes over it. However, I will clarify this for you myself. Know that when the first Bible was lost, the Christians gathered around their scholars and said to them, ‘’Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s) has been killed, and we have lost the Bible. You are the scholars. What do you have?’ Luke, Mark and John told them, ‘We have memorized the Bible. Do not worry about it. Do not forsake the churches. We will recite each Gospel of the Bible for you on each Sunday until we put it all together.’ Then Luke, Mark, John and Matthew gathered together and put together this Bible after you had lost the first one. These four students were of the first students. Did you know that?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “I did not know this before. Now I have learned it from you due to your noble knowledge of the Bible. I heard things which you knew from you - things which my heart testifies to be the truth. Therefore, I have gained a much better understanding.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “How do you consider what they bear witness to?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “I completely accept whatever they say is right and bear witness to it.” Then Al-Ridha (s) told Al-Ma’mun and those of his family and others who were present, “Be witnesses to this.” They said, “We witness to that.”Then the Imam (s) told the Catholic Archbishop, “I swear by the Son and his Mother to tell us whether you know that Matthew said the following, ‘The Messiah is the son of David, the son of Abraham, the son of Isaac, the son of Jacob, the son of Yehuda, the son of Khadrun.’ Mark said the following regarding the lineage of Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s), ‘He is God’s Word placed in the human body. So it turned into the human form.’ Moreover, Luke said, ‘Jesus the son of Mary and his mother were humans made of flesh and blood. Then the Holy Spirit entered into them.’ You also testify that Jesus had said the following about himself, ‘O disciples! I will tell you the truth. No one will ascend the heavens, except for him who descends therefrom, except for the Rider of the Camel - the Seal of the Prophets, for he will ascend the heavens and then will descend there from.’ What do you have to say about that?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “These are the words of Jesus (s). We do not deny them.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “If so, what do you say about the testimonies of Luke, Mark and Matthew regarding Jesus (s) and the lineage they attributed to him?”The Catholic Archbishop said, “They ascribed lies to Jesus (s).”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O people! Did he not just bear witness that they (Luke, Mark and Matthew) are the Scholars of the Bible and that what they say is the truth?” The Catholic Archbishop said, “O Scholar of the Muslims! I would like you to excuse me from discussing about these men.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Fine. I will excuse you from that. O Christian! Ask me whatever you wish to ask.” The Catholic said, “Let someone else ask you questions. By Jesus (s), I did not think that there was a scholar like you among the Muslims.”Al-Ridha (s) turned towards the High Rabbi and said, “Will you ask me questions or should I ask?” The High Rabbi said, “I will ask. However, I will not accept any proofs from you except those from the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms of David, or the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Do not accept any of my proofs unless they are from the Torah as expressed by Moses (s) - the son of Imran (s), the Bible as expressed by Jesus (s): the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s), or the Psalms of David as expressed by David (s).”The High Rabbi said, “How can you prove the Prophethood of Muhammad (s)?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Moses (s) - the son of Imran, Jesus (s) - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s) and David (s) - the Vicegerent of God on the Earth have testified to his Prophethood.”The High Rabbi said, “Provide evidence of the testimony of Moses the son of Imran.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “O Jew! Do you know that Moses said the following to the Children of Israel, ‘A Prophet will come to you from among your brethren. Believe in him and obey him.’ Do you know that the Children of Israel have no brethren other than the Children of Ishmael? Do you know about the ties of kinship between Israel and Ishmael and the relationship that existed between them from the pastthrough Abraham (s)?” The High Rabbi said, “These are the words of Moses. I do not deny them.” Al-Ridha (s) asked him, “Has any Prophet other than Muhammad (s) come from amongst the brethren of the Children of Israel?” He replied, “No.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Is this not correct in your opinion?” The High Rabbi said, “Yes, but I want you to prove its correctness from the Torah.”Al-Ridha (s) asked him, “Do you deny that the Torah says the following to you? ‘There came light from Mount Sina. Light shined upon us from Mount Sa’eer and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran.’” The High Rabbi said, “I am familiar with these words, but I do not know what they mean.’”Al-Ridha (s) said, “I will inform you about them. What is meant when it says ‘There came light from Mount Sina’ is a reference to the Blessed the Sublime God’s revelations to Moses (s) on Mount Sina. And what is meant when it says, ‘Light shined upon us from Mount Sa’eer’ is a reference to the Mountain upon which the Honorable the Exalted God sent revelations to Jesus (s) - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s). Jesus (s) was on that mountain. And what is meant when it says, ‘and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran’ is a reference to a mountain that is one day away from Mecca. As you and your friends said, the Prophet Sha’ya has said in the Torah that ‘I have seen the picture of the Rider of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel - who is as bright as the moon.’ Who is the Rider of the Donkey? Who is the Rider of the Camel?” The High Rabbi said, “I do not know who they are.” The Imam (s) said, “The Rider of the Donkey is Jesus (s) and the Rider of the Camel is Muhammad (s). Do you deny that this is from the Torah?” The High Rabbi said, “No, I do not deny that.”Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “Do you know the Prophet Hayquq (s)?” The High Rabbi said, “Yes, I know him.” The Imam (s) said, “He has said the following which your Book has also stated, ‘God brought down the Bay’an from Mount Faran. The heavens are filled with the glorification of Ahmad and his nation. He will carry his troops at sea just as he carries them on land. He will bring us a new Book after the destruction of the Holy House (in Jerusalem).’ Did you know this (statement) and do you believe in it?” The High Rabbi said, “In fact, the Prophet Hayquq (s) has said this. I will not deny his words.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “David said in his Psalms which you have also read, ‘O my God! Appoint him who will establish the Sunna (practice) after the cessation (of the Prophets).’ Did you know of any Prophet other than Muhammad (s) who has established the Sunna after the cessation (of the Prophets)?”The High Rabbi said, “This is what is said by David. We do not deny it. However, he meant Jesus by that, and it is his era that was the age of cessation.” Al-Ridha (s) told him, “You are wrong. In fact, Jesus (s) endorsed the Sunna (practices) of the Torah until God pulled him up to Himself. It is written in the Bible, ‘The son of pious woman will go, and the Paraclete will come after him. It is he who will preserve the bonds, explain everything to you, and testify to my truth just as I testified for him. I have brought you the examples, and he will bring you the interpretations.’ Do you believe that this statement is in the Bible?”The High Rabbi said, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “O the High Rabbi! I want to ask you about your Prophet Moses (s). The High Rabbi said, “Ask.” The Imam (s) said, “What is the evidence for the Prophethood of Moses?”The Jew said, “He brought miracles which the Prophets before him had not brought.” The Imam (s) asked, “Could you give me an example?” The High Rabbi replied, “He split the sea, turned the cane into a running serpent, cleaved the stones so that springs gushed forth from them, took out his hand shining white for the onlookers, and other signs the like of which other creatures were unable to bring.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “You are right. They are proofs of his Prophethood. He brought the like of which other creatures were unable to bring. Is it obligatory on you to believe in whoever claims Prophethood and performs something which all other creatures are unable to perform?”The High Rabbi said, “No, since there is no one like Moses (s) considering his position near his Lord and his closeness to Him. It is not incumbent upon us to profess the Prophethood of whoever claims it, unless he brings us miracles similar to those brought by Moses (s).”The Imam (s) said, “Then how come you admit the Prophethood of the other Prophets who preceded Moses who did not split the sea; nor didthey cleave the stone so that twelve springs would gush forth from them; nor did they take their hands out shining white as Moses did; nor did they turn the cane into a running serpent.”The Jew replied, “I told you that if they performed miracles as evidence for their Prophethood which all other creatures were unable to perform, and if they brought something the like of which Moses had brought or they followed what Moses had brought, then it is incumbent upon us to believe in them.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “O High Rabbi! What has prevented you from professing (the Prophethood of) Jesus (s) - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s)? Jesus (s) brought the dead to life, healed the blind and the leprous, made birds formed of clay and breathed at them giving them life with God’s permission.”The High Rabbi said, “It is said that he did that, but we did not see it.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Have you seen the miracles performed by Moses? Have you not received this news by way of Moses’s closest trustworthy companions who said he (s) did them?” The High Rabbi said, “Yes. That is so.”The Imam (s) said, “Well. The news about the miracles of Jesus (s) - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary (s) have reached you in a similar fashion. Why then did you acknowledge Moses (s) and believe in him, but you did not believe in Jesus?” The High Rabbi did not answer. Al-Ridha (s) said, “The same is true about Muhammad (s) and his miracles. The same is true about any other Prophet appointed by God. One of the miracles of Muhammad (s) was that he was a poor hired shepherd. He had not been taught anything. He did not go to any teachers. However, the Quran which he (s) brought contains the stories of the Prophets (s) and the associated news letter by letter. It has narrated the news of the past and the things to come in the future all the way up until the Resurrection Day. The Quran provided information about what they did in hiding or in their homes. He brought innumerable miracles.” The High Rabbi said, “Neither the account about Jesus nor that about Muhammad are considered correct by us. It is not permissible to admit their Prophethood through what is not correct.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Has the witness who testified for Jesus and Muhammad then given false testimony?” The High Rabbi did not answer him.Then the Imam (s) called the Zoroastrian High Priest. Al-Ridha (s) told him, “Let me know about Zoroaster who considered himself to be a Prophet. What is your proof of his Prophethood?” The Zoroastrian High Priest said, “He had miracles which no one ever had before him. Of course, I have not seen him, but the stories of our ancestors tell us that he made legitimate for us things which others had not made legitimate. Therefore, we follow him.”The Imam (s) asked, “You believed in the stories which came to you about him, so you followed him, didn’t you?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (s) said, “This is the case with all other nations. Stories came to them about what the Prophets had accomplished, and what Moses (s), Jesus (s), and Muhammad (s) had all brought to them. So why didn’t you believe in any of these Prophets, having believed in Zoroaster through the stories that came to you about him saying that he brought forth what others did not?” The Zoroastrian High Priest froze in place.Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “O people! If any of you is opposed to Islam and wants to ask me any questions, then let him ask me without any shame.” Imran As-Sa’bee who was an expert in theology stood up and said, “O Scholar of the people. I would not have asked you any questions if you had not invited me to ask. I have been to Kufa, Basra, Syria and Algeria. There I have met many theologians. However, none of them has been able to establish for me the proof that there is One who has no second other than Him and that He remains to be One Being. Will you permit me to ask you this question?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “If Imran As-Sab’ee is present among the people here, it must be you.” He said, “Yes. This is me.” The Imam (s) said, “O Imran! Ask. But I advise you to be fair. Avoid vain talk and nonsense.” Imran said, “My Master! By God, I just want you to prove something which I can adhere to for me. Then I need not seek anything else.” The Imam (s) said, “Ask whatever you wish to ask.” The crowds moved closer to Imran and crowded in on him. Imran As-Sa’bee asked, “Let me know of the first thing and what it created.”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “You asked. Now try to understand. As for the One, He has always been One Being. He has neither limits nor does Hehave transient qualities. He will always remain so. Then unprecedentedly He created a different creature with transient qualities and various different limits. He neither placed it in anything, nor did He limit it by anything. He neither created it like anything, nor did He create other thing like it. He then created the creatures in various shapes: pure and impure, different and alike, with various colors, flavors and tastes. He did not create them out of a need for them, nor did He create them to attain a higher rank. He did not sense any increase or decrease in Himself due to this Creation. O Imran! Do you understand this?” Imran said, “By God, yes my Master!”The Imam (s) added, “O Imran! Know that if He had created what He created since He needed them, He would have only created things by which He could fulfill His need. In that case, it would have been better for Him to create several times more than what He created, since the more the helpers were, the more powerful their master would be. O Imran! In that case, His need would be a never-ending one. The more He created, the more newer needs appeared for Him. That is why we say that He did not create the creatures out of need. Through Creation He transfers the needs of some of them to others. And He makes some of them nobler than others without any need of the nobler one or without wanting to take any revenge against those whom He had debased. That is how He has created.”Imran asked, “Master! Was the Being known to Himself by His Own Self?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “It is the case that knowledge of something is required to distinguish it from other things, and to prove its existence through what it is negated about it. However, there was nothing else there to oppose Him to make it necessary to negate. Since there was only Him there was no need to establish limits. O Imran! Do you understand?”Imran said, “Yes, by God, my Master! Then tell me, by what means did He come to know what He knew. Was it done by conscience or by something else?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “If it had been that His Knowledge was acquired by conscience, can’t we then establish any limits for that conscience where Knowledge ends?” Imran answered, “There is no way out.” The Imam (s) then asked him, “Then what is that conscience?” Imran could not provide any answer.Al-Ridha (s) said, “Never mind. O Imran! If I now ask you about that conscience and whether you can recognize it through another conscience, and you answer if the affirmative, have you not then disproved your own statement and claim? O Imran! Is it not more proper for you to know that the One cannot be described by a conscience? And that the most that can be said about Him is that He has done something, or created something?He is not such that one can conceive any directions or parts for Him as can be imagined for the creatures and their parts. Understand this and base your proper knowledge on it.”Imran asked, “O my Master! Can you let me know what are the types of limits for His creatures? What is the meaning and what are the varieties of His creatures?”The Imam (s) said, “You asked. Now understand. In fact, there are six types of limits for His creatures. These are the tangibles; the weighable; the seeable; those that have no weight - that is spirit; those that are seeable but are without any weight, are untouchable, intangible, colorless, and tasteless; and the measurable that are the widths, the forms, width and height. Included amongst them are deeds and movements which make things, act upon them, change them from one state to another, increase them, or reduce them. As for deeds and movements, they pass by since they have no more time than that which is ordained for their need. Whenever a deed is finished and the movement is stopped it ends, but its effects remain just like talking which ends but its effect remains.”Imran said, “O my Master! Will you let me know about the Creator? If He is One, there is nothing other than Him and there is nothing with Him, has He not changed (His Essence) through creating the creatures?”Al-Ridha (s) told him, “He is Eternal. The Honorable the Exalted does not change due to creating the creatures. However, the creatures change through the changes which He exerts upon them.”Imran asked, “O my Master! With what have we recognized Him?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “With something other than Him.” Imran asked, “What is something other than Him?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “His Volition, His Name, His Attribute, and the like which are all originated, created and managed (by Him).”Imran said, “O my Master! Then what is He?” The Imam (s) replied, “He is Light. That means that He guides His creatures from among the people of the heavens and the Earth. You have no rights incumbent upon me more than my professing His Unity to you.”Imran said, “O my Master! Was He not silent before creating the creatures and then He spoke?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Silence does not exist unless there is some utterance before it. An example of this is that it is not said that the lamp is silent and does not utter; nor is it said that the lamp shines implying that it wants to do something to us. The light shining from the lamp is not considered to be the act of the lamp. It is not something separate from the lamp. Therefore, when it is illuminating us we say that it was lit for us by which we found our way around. Through this example you can find what you are after and become enlightened in your affairs.”Imran said, “O my Master! I thought that the Ever-Being is changed in His own Essence by His action of creating the creatures.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Imran! What you said that the Ever-Being will change in one or another way (by acting) and that this change will affect His own Essence, and thereby changes Him. O Imran! Have you ever seen that the changes in fire change it? Have you ever seen heat burn itself? Have you ever seen an eye see itself?” Imran said, “No I have not. O my Master! Will you let me know whether He is in the creatures or the creatures are in Him?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Imran! He is Exalted and above all that. He is not in the creatures; nor are the creatures in Him. He is High above that. I will teach you what you do not know. There is no strength save in God. Tell me about the mirror: are you in it or is it in you? O Imran! If neither one of you is in the other, then by what thing do you reason that you can see your own reflection in it?”Imran said, “Through the light between me and the mirror.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Can you see more of that light in the mirror than what you see in your own eyes?”He answered, “Yes.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Then show it to us!” It was then that the man was too baffled to say a word. The Imam (s) said, “I do not see the light, except leading you and the mirror to come to know each other without being in either one of you. There are many other suchexamples which the ignorant simply cannot comprehend. God is the highest such example.”Then the Imam (s) turned to Al-Ma’mun and told him, “Now it is time to pray.”Imran said, “O my Master! Do not interrupt my questions since I am feeling inclined towards you in my heart.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “We will pray and come back.”Then the Imam (s) stood up. Al-Ma’mun got up, too. Then Al-Ridha (s) prayed inside and the people prayed outside led by Muhammad ibn Ja’far. Then the Imam (s) came out, returned to the meeting, called out to Imran and said, “O Imran! Ask your questions.”Imran said, “O my Master! Will you let me know whether the Unity of the Honorable the Exalted God is perceived through reality or through description?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Certainly, God is the Only Initiator, and the first Ever-Being. He has always been One without anything to accompany Him. He is One and there are no seconds for Him. He is neither definite nor indefinite. He is neither decisive nor allegorical. He is neither mentioned nor forgotten. He is not a thing such that a name of things can fit Him. There is no time for the beginning of His Being. And there is no time until which only He will last. He has not been standing upon anything else, nor will He be standing upon anything. There is nothing up until which He is. There is nothing on which He leans. He had all these attributes before creating anything when there was nothing but Him. Whatever you attribute to Him will be originated attributes which are only means for understanding Him, which anyone possessing understanding can comprehend.Know that innovation, volition, and will have the same meaning with different names. His foremost innovation, will and volition were the letters which He established as the origin of everything, the evidence for all perceived things, and the separator for all vague things. Everything was separated by these letters: things such as the name of right and wrong, action and object, meaning and meaningless. All affairs were run based on them. He did not establish any limited meaning for them other than what they were themselves when He originated the letters. He didnot establish for them any existence other than themselves since they were originated via innovation. Here Light is God’s first deed: The deed of God who is the Light of the heavens and the Earth Himself. It was through that deed which the letters became action. It is the letters upon which speech is based. Expressions are all from the Honorable the Exalted God who taught them to His creatures. There are thirty-three letters. Twenty-eight of them are the letters on which the Arabic language is based. Twenty-two of the twenty-eight letters show the letters of the Assyrian and Hebrew languages. Five of them were separated and are in the rest of the languages of non-Arabs in the regions. These are the five letters which were separated from the twenty-eight letters. Therefore, there are thirty-three letters. It is not permissible to mention more about them than what we have mentioned regarding these five letters which were separated. He then established the letters after counting them and numbering them as His own deed. An example of this is in the Honorable the Exalted God’s words, ‘We but say the word, ‘Be’, and it is.’ Here ‘be’ refers to God’s Creation, and ‘what is created’ refers to the creature. Thus the first Creation by the Honorable the Exalted God was innovation which has neither any weight nor any movement. It is neither heard nor does it have any color. It is intangible. And the second thing that was created are the letters which neither have any weight nor any color. They are neither heard nor described. They are not seeable. The third creature includes all the various kinds of things which are perceptible, tangible, tasteable, and seeable. The Blessed the Sublime God existed before innovation as there has been nothing before the Honorable the Exalted God, and nothing with him. Innovation was created before the letters were created, and the letters do not indicate anything other than themselves.”Al-Ma’mun asked, “How come they do not indicate anything other than themselves?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Surely, the Blessed the Sublime God never combines any of them together unless to mean something. When He combines several letters together, say four, five, and six or more, He uses them to originate a new meaning which did not exist before.”Imran asked, “How can we understand this better?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “This is how it can be understood. When you only want to refer to the letters and not anything else, you mention them one by one and say, a b c d e f g etc. Here you find no meaning in them other than themselves. But when you put several letters together you construct names and attributes for a meaning which you have in mind. They will now demonstrate the meaning for which they were intended. Did you understand this?”Imran said, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Know that an attribute cannot be without what it describes. Also a name cannot be without a meaning. A limit cannot be without a limited. All attributes and names indicate perfection and existence. They do not indicate encompassment, as the limits do. Limits make squares, make triangles, and make hexagons. Indeed the recognition of the Honorable the Exalted God is perceived by attributes and names, not by limits such as length, width, smallness, largeness, color, weight, and the like. No such limits are applicable to the Exalted the All-Holy God, so that His creatures could recognize Him by recognizing themselves. This is certain as I said, but the Honorable the Exalted God’s attributes prove Him. He can be understood through His Names. We can argue about His Existence by referring to the existence of His creatures. A true seeker does not need to see Him with his own eyes, or hear Him with his own ears, or touch Him with his own hands, or encompass Him with his own heart. Were it not the case that His attributes proved Him - Exalted is His Praise - and His Names denoted Him, it was not possible for the taught knowledge of the creatures to perceive Him. Then the creatures would have worshipped His Names and Attributes instead of His Meaning. Were it any different, the Only Worshipped One would have been other than God since God’s Names and Attributes are other than Him. Imran! Did you understand?” Imran said, “Yes, my Master. Please tell me more.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Beware of the sayings of the ignorant people from among those whose hearts are blind and are at a loss - those who claim that the Exalted the All-Holy God is present in the Hereafter for the Reckoning concerning rewards and punishments, but He is not present in this world for the acts of obedience and hope. If it were that the Honorable the Exalted God’s presence was a source of His beingdefective in this world, He would not be present in the Hereafter either. However, these people have gone astray, have become blind, and deaf toward the truth regarding what they do not know. That is according to the Words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘But those who were blind in this world, will be blind in the Hereafter, and most astray from the Path.’ What is meant by blindness here is blindness regarding existing realities. Intellectuals know that reasoning about what exists in the Hereafter is only possible through what exists in this world. Whoever tries to adopt knowledge of that world based upon his own personal views, and seek its existence or tries to perceive it through his own soul, and not through anything else would only get more distant from the facts about that world. That is because the Honorable the Exalted God has entrusted the knowledge of that world to an especial group of people who think, know and understand.”Imran asked, “Is innovation a created being or not?” Imam Al-Ridha (s) answered, “It is a still Creation which cannot be perceived through stillness. It is a created being since it has been created. And it is the Sublime God who has originated it. Thus it has become a creature. In other words, there only exist the Honorable the Exalted God and His creatures. There exists no third thing in between, and there is no third thing other than them. Whatever the Honorable the Exalted God creates does not disobey from being His creature. What is created is either still, moving, different, harmonious, known, or ambiguous. Whatever is bounded is the Honorable the Exalted God’s creature.Moreover, know that all the things which the senses find for you are meanings perceived by the senses, and every sense demonstrates what the Honorable the Exalted God has placed in its perception, and the heart understands all of that. Know that the One who is Ever-Standing without any ordination or bounds created creatures ordained by bounds and ordination. What He created were two creatures: the ordination and the ordained. Neither one had any color, weight or taste. He established one as the means of perceiving the other and made them such that they could be perceived on their own. He did not create anything which could stand alone relying only on itself so as to provide a means for arguing about and proving His own existence.Thus the Blessed the Sublime God is One and Only. There is no second one to support Him in order to enable Him to stand, or to assist Him or protect Him. However, the creatures support one another through the permission and will of the Sublime God. People have differences of opinion over this subject to the extent that they have gone astray, become perplexed, and seek salvation from darkness by means of darkness through describing the Sublime God using their own qualities. In this way, they have become very far away from the truth. Had they described the Honorable the Exalted God using His own Attributes, and described the creatures with the qualities of the creatures, they would have spoken through understanding and certitude and would not have come up with so many differences of opinion over Him. Since they sought that which would perplex them, and get entrapped, they became confused. God guides whomever He wills to the straight path.”Imran said, “O my Master! I bear witness that He is just as you have described. However, I still have one more question to ask.” The Imam (s) said, “Ask whatever you wish to ask.”Imran said, “I want to ask you what the All-Wise (God) is contained in. Has anything encompassed Him? Does He change from one state to another state? Is He in need of anything?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Imran! I will tell you, so understandWhom you have questioned about. He is the most ambiguous issues which the creatures face. As for those who are deficient in understanding, they do not recognize Him. As for those who are just and can reason, they are not incapable of understanding Him. First of all, if He had created the creatures due to needing them, then it would be proper to say that He changes His Location to the location of what He creates because of His need for them. However, the Honorable the Exalted God has not created anything out of need. He is always stable. Neither is He on something, or something is on Him. However, it is the creatures which hold each other, enter into one another, and leave one another. As for the Great and All-Holy God, He holds all of that by His Might. He does not enter anything and does not leave anything. Its preservation does not tire Him, nor is He incapable of holding it. None of the creatures knows how that is, except for the Honorable the Exalted God and His Messengers, the People who know His Secrets, those whorun the Affairs, and His Guardians who carry out His Laws. God Himself has informed them about it. In fact, His command is like the twinkling of an eye. If He wills a thing, He only says to it be, ‘We but say the word, ‘Be’, and it is.’  according to His intent and will. Nothing that He has created is closer to Him than any other thing. O Imran! Have you understood?” Imran said, “Yes, my Master. I understood. I bear witness that the Sublime God is as you described Him to be, He is One. I also witness that Muhammad (s) - his servant - is appointed to guide and lead to the right religion.” He then faced the Qibla and fell into prostration.Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said, “When the other rhetoricians heard what Imran al-Sabee - who was very hard to defeat in arguments and no one had ever defeated him before in arguments - none of them dared approach Al-Ridha (s), and they asked him no more questions. Slowly the sun set. Then Al-Ma’mun and Al-Ridha (s) stood up, went inside and the people left.I was sitting along with some of my friends when Muhammad ibn Ja’far called me in. I went to see him.He told me, “O Nawfali! Did you see what your friend (the Imam (s)) did?” Al-Nawfali replied, “By God! No. I did not think that Ali ibn Musa Al-Ridha (s) could plumb such depths. I did not know that him in this way. He never spoke about theology in Medina and theologians never gathered around him.” I said, “The pilgrims come to him and ask him about the lawful and the unlawful and he answers them. Sometimes rhetoricians come to him and argue with him, and he plunges into theology.”Muhammad ibn Ja’far said, “O Aba Muhammad! I fear that this man (i.e. Al-Ma’mun) will envy him, poison him or injure him. So advise him to refrain from these things.”Al-Nawfali added, “I said, ‘He will not listen to me. This man (Al-Ma’mun) only wants to test him to see whether he possesses any of the knowledge of his forefathers (s).’He told me, “Tell him that his uncle does not like him to do such things and wishes him to quit doing these things.” When we returned to Al-Ridha’s (s) house I related to the Imam (s) the message from his uncle. Then the Imam (s) smiled and said, “May God protect my uncle. I knowhim well. Why is he upset? O servant! Go to Imran al-Sa’ebi and bring him here.”I said, “May I be your ransom! I know where he is. He is with some of the Shiite brethren.” The Imam (s) said, “Don’t worry. Take a horse for him to ride on and bring him here.” I went and brought Imran. The Imam (s) welcomed him and asked for a robe of honor which he (s) put on Imran. The Imam also gave him a horse and asked for ten-thousand Dinars which he (s) donated to Imran.Imran said, “May I be your ransom! You have followed in the footsteps of your grandfather - the Commander of the Faithful (s).” The Imam (s) said, “We prefer this.” Then the Imam (s) ordered dinner and had me sit on his right side and had Imran sit on his left side. After eating dinner, the Imam (s) told Imran, “Go now and come back in the morning. Then I will give you food from Medina.”From then on many people came to Imran to have a debate. He used to respond to their arguments and disprove them until they left. Al-Ma’mun granted him ten thousand Dirhams. Al-Fadhl gave him some money, too. Then he appointed him as the director over the alms in (the city of) Balkh where he attained much good.",

    "englishText": "13-1 Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Ahmad, the jurist, narrated that Abu Muhammad Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Sadaqat al-Qumi quoted on the authority of Abu Amr Muhammad ibn Abdul Aziz Al-Ansari al-Kajji, on the authority of Al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali, that Soleiman al-Marwazi, the most prominent religious scholar in Khorasan, went to see Al-Ma’mun. Al-Ma’mun honored him, granted him gifts and said, “My cousin Ali ibn Musa Al-Ridha (s) has come here from Hijaz. He likes theology and theologians. Thus it would not be any trouble if you came to hold adebate with him on the 8th of Dhul-Hajja (the Day of Tarwiyah) to have a debate with him.”Soleiman said, “O Commander of the Faithful! I dislike questioning him in your session and amongst a group of the Hashemites. The people will regard him as incapable when he debates with me on theology. Incapabilities are not permissible for him.”Al-Ma’mun said, “I have invited you because I know that you are learned (in theology). I have no intentions except for you to silence him in an argument.” Soleiman said, “O Commander of the Faithful! I will do it for you. Just bring us together. Just sit back and watch.”Then Al-Ma’mun sent someone after Al-Ridha (s) and said, “A man from Marwaz who is not equal to you in theology has come and asked for you to come to us. Come here if you do not mind.” The Imam (s) made ablutions and told us to go ahead. Imran As-Sa’ebee was with us. We went until we arrived at Al-Ma’mun’s court. Yasir and Khalid took my hands and led me in. When I got in and greeted (Al-Ma’mun), he asked, “Where is my brother Abul Hassan whom may the Sublime God maintain?” I said, “When we were coming he was putting on his clothes. He ordered us to go ahead.” Then I added, “O Commander of the Faithful! Your servant Imran is also with me. He is right outside.” He said, “Who is Imran?” I said, “He is the Sabian who became a Muslim because of you.” He said, “Let him in.” Then Imran came in. Al-Ma’mun welcomed him and then told him, “O Imran! You did not die and join the Hashemites!” Imran said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Praise be to God who honored me by you.” Al-Ma’mun said, “O Imran! This is Soleiman al-Marwazi who is the theologian from Khorasan.” Imran said, “O Commander of the Faithful! He thinks that he is the only one in Khorasan versed in theoretical principles and refutes origination (bida’). Al-Ma’mun said, “Why don’t you have a debate with him?” Imran said, “This depends on him.” Then Al-Ridha (s) came in and asked, “What were you discussing?” Imran said, “O son of the Prophet of God! This is Soleiman al-Marwazi.”Soleiman told Imran, “Will you be pleased with Abil Hassan (s) and what he says about origination. Imran said, “Yes, I will if he (s) presents arguments which I can present when I argue with other theologians like myself.”Al-Ma’mun said, “O Abul Hassan! What is your opinion regarding what they argue about?” The Imam (s) said, “O Soleiman! How could you not believe in origination while the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing?’  And the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘It is He Who begins (the process of) Creation; then repeats it…’  And says, ‘To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth…’  Moreover, the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘He adds to Creation as He pleases…’  and says, ‘…He began the Creation of man with (nothing more than) clay.’  Also the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘There are (yet) others, held in suspense for the command of God, whether He will punish them, or turn in mercy to them…’  And the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…Nor is a man long-lived granted length of days, nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Decree (ordained)…’ Soleiman asked, “Has anything been narrated to you on this issue from your forefather?” The Imam (s) said, “Yes. It has been narrated by my father on the authority of Abi Abdullah (s) who said, “The Honorable the Exalted God has two bodies of knowledge: a Treasured Knowledge, Hidden Knowledge which no one but Him is informed of. Origination is rooted in that knowledge. And He has a second knowledge which He has taught the angels and His Messengers which the knowledgeable Members of the Holy Household are also aware of.”Soleiman said, “I would like you to present this from the Book of the Honorable the Exalted God.” The Imam (s) said, “The Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘So turn away from them: not thine is the blame.’  At first God wanted to destroy them. But then the Sublime God changed His mind and said, ‘But teach (thy Message) for teaching benefits the Believers.’ Soleiman said, “May I be your ransom! Tell me more.” Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “My father (s) informed me on the authority of his forefathers (s), on the authority of God’s Prophet (s) that the Honorable the Exalted God revealed to one of His Prophets to let one of the Kings know that God will take away his life at such and such a time. The Prophet (s) went to see the King and told him that. Then the King pleaded to God while he was on his bed and fell off of it. He said, “O Lord! Postpone my demise until I see my son grow up to undertake my affairs.” Then the Honorablethe Exalted God revealed to that Prophet (s), “Go to that King and inform him that I have decided to postpone his death. I have added fifteen years to his life.”The Prophet (s) said, “O Lord! You well know that I have never lied.” Then the Honorable the Exalted God revealed to him, “You are just an agent. Announce this to him. God is never questioned about what He does.” Then the Imam (s) turned towards Soleiman and said, “I think you have the same opinion as the Jews in this regard.” Soleiman said, “From this I seek refuge in God.” The Imam (s) said, “The Jews say, ‘God’s hand is tied up...’ They mean that God is finished working and is sitting back and does not Create anything else. But the Honorable the Exalted God has given them the following answer, ‘…Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the (blasphemy) they utter….’  I have also heard my father Musa ibn Ja’far (s) say the following when asked about Origination, ‘How could the people refute origination, and that God might procrastinate the affairs of some people for a decision regarding them?’”Soleiman asked, “Can you tell me for what has the following verse been revealed? ‘We have indeed revealed this (Message) in the Night of Power.’  The Imam (s) said, “O Soleiman! The Honorable the Exalted God will decide the destiny (of an individual) for one year including life or death, good or bad, and sustenance on the Night of Power. Whatever God destines on that night comes to be.” Soleiman said, “Now I understand. Please tell me more.”The Imam (s) said, “O Soleiman! Some of the affairs are up to the Honorable the Exalted God and what He wills. He can expedite what He wills and procrastinate what He wills. He can destroy what He wills. O Soleiman, Ali (s) said, “Knowledge is of two types: Knowledge which God has taught His angels and His Messengers - that which God has taught His angels and His Messengers will be done, and that which is hidden near Him and He has informed none of His creatures of it. It is by this knowledge which He expedites what He wills to expedite, procrastinates what He wills to procrastinate; destroys what He wills to destroy, and He stabilizes what He wills to stabilize.”Soleiman told Al-Ma’mun, “O Commander of the Faithful! From today on I will not refute Creation or deny it by God’s Will.” Al-Ma’mun said,“O Soleiman! Ask Abul Hassan whatever you wish. Just listen carefully and be fair.” Soleiman said, “O my Master! May I ask?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Ask whatever you wish.”Soleiman said, “What is your view about someone who considers will to be a name - an attribute similar to ‘ living’, ‘hearing’, ‘seeing’, and ‘powerful’?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “You say that things were originated and became different because He so desired and willed. But you do not say that things were originated and became different because He is All-Hearing and All-Seeing. This is a proof that they (i.e. will and desire) are not similar to All-Hearing, All-Seeing, and All-Powerful.”Soleiman said, “He has always been willing.” The Imam answered him, “O Soleiman! Is His will something other than Him?”He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (s) said, “Then you have proved that there has always been something along with Him forever.” Soleiman said, “No, I have not.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Is will originated?” Soleiman said, “No. It is not.” Then Al-Ma’mun shouted at him and said, “O Soleiman! Are you showing obstinacy and giving vague answers to such a person as him. You must be fair. Don’t you see that people of intellect are sitting around you?” Then Al-Ma’mun said, “O Abul Hassan! Continue your debate on theology with him since he is the theologian of Khorasan.”Then the Imam asked him, “O Soleiman! Is it (the will) originated? Whatever is not Eternal is certainly originated. And if it is not originated it is Eternal.”Soleiman said, “His (Allah’s) will is (part) of Him just as His Hearing, His Sight and His Knowledge are (parts) of Him.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Did He will Himself?” Soleiman answered, “No.” The Imam (s) said, “Therefore, willing is not like the hearing and the seeing.” Soleiman said, “Surely, He willed Himself just as He heard Himself, saw Himself, and recognized Himself.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “What is the meaning of ‘He willed Himself’? Did He will to be a thing? Did He will to be All-Living, All-Hearing, All-Seeing or All-Powerful?”Soleiman said, “Yes.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Did that occur through His will?” Soleiman answered, ‘Yes.’ Al-Ridha (s) said, “Then your statement, ‘Hewilled to be All-Living, All-Hearing, and All-Seeing,’ does not make any sense since they were not done through His Will.” Soleiman said, “Yes. That was through His Will.”Then Al-Ma’mun and the people around him burst into laughter. Al-Ridha (s) laughed too and said, “Do not be too hard on the theologian from Khorasan. O Soleiman! “Do you think that He (i.e. Allah, the Exalted) has altered from state to state and changed due to it? This is something by which the Honorable the Exalted God cannot be described.” Soleiman remained silent.Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! May I ask you a question?”Soleiman said, “May I be your ransom! Ask.”The Imam (s) said, “Tell me about you and your companions: Do you debate with the people on theology according to what you understand and know or according to what you do not understand and do not know?” Soleiman said, “Yes! (We debate) according to what we understand and know.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “The thing which the people know is that the willing is different from the will. The willing exists before the will. The subject is before the object. This (statement) disproves your statement, ‘The willing and the willed are the same thing.’” Soleiman said, “May I be your ransom! This is not what the people know about and understand.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “I think that you have claimed to have the knowledge without having a true recognition of it and said, ’Willing is like hearing and seeing’ while this view is not based on knowledge or the intellect.” Soleiman could not answer.Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! Does God have knowledge of all those who are in Paradise and the Fire?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”The Imam (s) said, “Will what the Sublime God knows would be created in the future, actually be created?” Soleiman answered, “Yes.”The Imam (s) said, “If it is done to the extent that nothing else remains, can God add more to them or will He stop doing so?”Soleiman said, “He will add to them.” The Imam (s) said, “Then based on what you have said, God adds to them what He did not know would be created.” Then he added, “May I be your ransom! There is no limit foradding.” The Imam (s) said, “Then in your opinion His Knowledge does not encompass what is therein (in Paradise), since He does not know the limit of that which will be in Paradise. If His Knowledge does not encompass what is therein, then He would not know what will be there before they existed. The Honorable the Exalted God is Exalted High above that!”Soleiman said, “When I said God does not know about them it was because they have no limit and the Honorable the Exalted God Himself has described them as eternal. Therefore we do not want to assume an end for them.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “God’s Knowledge of them will not limit them. There are many instances of which He has knowledge, then He adds to them and does not take away what He has added to them. These are supported by the Words of the Honorable the Exalted God in His Book, ‘…as often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty…’  And He told the residents of Paradise, ‘…a gift without break.’  And the Honorable the Exalted said, ‘Whose season is not limited, nor (supply) forbidden?’ Therefore the Honorable the Exalted God knows about these and does not block them from accessing to what is added. Will He not replace what the residents of Paradise eat and drink?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”The Imam (s) said, “Has He stopped His Granting now that He has replaced the consumed foods and drinks?” Soleiman said, “No.”Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! Tell me about Will: Is it an action or not?”Soleiman said, “It is an action.”The Imam (s) said, “Therefore it is originated, for all actions are originated.” Soleiman said, “It is not an action.”The Imam (s) said, “Has there then been something else with Him who is eternal?” Soleiman said, “The Will is the same as bringing forth.”The Imam (s) said, “O Soleiman! This is exactly what you criticized Dirar and his companions of, saying that everything that the Honorable the Exalted God has created in the heavens, the Earth, the oceans or on land such as dogs, pigs, monkeys, humans or animals are God’s Will, and that God’s Will lives, dies, goes away, eats, drinks, marries, feels pleasure, oppresses, commits immoral acts, disbelieves, becomes a polytheist. We denounce this and oppose it. This is its limit.”Soleiman said, “It (i.e. will) is like hearing, seeing and knowledge.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “You just returned to what you said before. Tell me: Are hearing, seeing and knowledge made?”Soleiman said, “No.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “How do you then refute Will? You sometimes say that He did not will and sometimes you say that He willed, and that it (i.e. will) was not one of His actions.”Soleiman said, “Surely, that is like saying, He sometimes knows and sometimes does not know!”Al-Ridha (s) said, “That is not the same, for negating the known is not like negating knowledge; negating what is willed is (not like) negating the will, for if the thing is not willed, there will be no will. However, sometimes there is knowledge, but there may be no known thing. This is like seeing. Man may be able to see, but there may be nothing there for him to see. Likewise, there may be knowledge, but there is no known thing.” Soleiman said, “It (i.e. will) is made.” The Imam (s) said, “Therefore, it (will) is originated and is not like hearing and seeing, for hearing and seeing are not made, and it (will) is made.”Soleiman said, “It (will) is one of His eternal attributes.” The Imam (s) answered, “Therefore, man must be eternal, for his quality is eternal.”Soleiman said, “No, because He did not do it (will)”. Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Khorasani! How often you make mistakes! Are things not made according to His Will and Words?” Soleiman said, “No.” The Imam (s) said, “If things are not made according to His Will or Volition, His Command or His Practice, then how are they made? God is High Exalted above that!” Soleiman could not respond.Then Al-Ridha (s) asked, “Will you not tell me about these Words of the Honorable the Exalted God: ‘When We decide to destroy a population, We (first) send a definite order to those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress…’By ‘We decide’ does God mean that He creates His own Will?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”The Imam (s) answered him, “If He creates His own Will, then your statement that ‘Will is He Himself or is a part of him’ is futile, for it is not (possible) for Him to create Himself and God does not change His State. God is High Exalted above that.”Soleiman told him, “Yes.” The Imam (s) said, “Then if He originates the Will, what you said, “Will is the same as God Himself or a part thereof” is wrong since God does not originate Himself or change from His current state. God is High Exalted above that.”Soleiman asked, “By that He does not mean that He creates His own will?”The Imam (s) asked, “So what does He mean?”Soleiman said, “He means doing something.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Woe unto you! How many times have you repeated this issue? I told you that will is originated, since the action and the Creation of a thing is originated.”Soleiman said, “Then this has no meaning.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Do you then think that He describes Himself with will which has no meaning? If will has no eternal or originated meaning, then that will nullify your statement, “The Honorable the Exalted God has always been willing.” Soleiman said, “I mean to say that willing has been one of the eternal actions of the Sublime God.”The Imam (s) said, “Don’t you know that what is eternal cannot be made, originated and eternal at the same time?”Soleiman could not answer. Al-Ridha (s) said, “Never mind! Complete your questions.” Soleiman said, “Did you say that Will is one of His Attributes?”The Imam (s) said, “Why do you repeat this so many times? Are His Attributes originated or eternal?” Soleiman said, “Originated.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “God is the Greatest! You are telling me that the Will is originated, even though it is one of His Eternal Attributes. Therefore God has not willed anything!” The Imam (s) added, “Whatever is eternal is not created.”Soleiman said, “Things are not the same as the will, and He did not will anything.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! You are whispering. Has God created what He has not willed to create? This is an attribute of someone who does not know what he is doing. God is High Exalted above that!”Soleiman said, “O my Master! I have already informed you that it is like hearing, seeing and knowing.”Al-Ma’mun said, “O Soleiman! Woe unto you! How often have you erred and how often have you have repeated yourself? Stop it and take up another issue since you seem to be unable to provide any better answer than that.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Leave him alone! Do not interrupt his questions, since then he will regard it as an argument (against me). O Soleiman! Speak.”Soleiman said, “I have already informed you that it is like hearing, seeing and knowing.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Never mind! Tell me whether will has one meaning or several meanings.” Soleiman said, “One meaning.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Is the meaning of all the wills then the same?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “If its meanings are the same, then it must be that the will to stand up is the same as the will to sit down, or the will to live isthe same as the will to die. If His Will is all one thing, then none of God’s desires will take precedence over any others. None will be any different from any others. They will all be one thing.”Soleiman replied, “Surely, the meanings are different.”The Imam (s) said, “Then, tell me about the willed. Is it the same as the will or is it something else?” Soleiman said, “Yes. It is the same as the will.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Then according to you the willed is something else since it is the same as the will.” Soleiman said, “O my Master! Will is not the same as the willed.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Then will is originated. Otherwise it must be that something else existed along with God. Understand this well. Continue on with your questions.”Soleiman said, “It is one of His Names.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Did He name Himself that?”Soleimam replied, “No. He did not name Himself that.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Therefore, you have no right to name Him with what He did not name Himself.” Soleiman said, “But He described Himself to be willed.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “The fact that He has described Himself as willed does not mean that He wanted to inform us that He is the Will, or that Will is one of His Names.” Soleiman said, “That is because His Will is the same as His Knowledge.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Ignorant one! If He knows something, does that not mean that He has willed it.” Soleiman said, “Yes.” The Imam (s) asked, “But if He does not will something, does that mean that He does not know it?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”The Imam (s) said, “What is your source for that statement? What is the evidence that His Will is the same as His Knowledge? He may know something but never Will it. This is supported by what the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent thee by inspiration…’ And God knows how to take it away, but He never will.” Soleiman said, “That is because He has finished running the affairs and will not add anything to what He has destined.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “This is what the Jews say. The Sublime God said, ‘…Call on Me; I will answer your (Prayer)…’ Soleiman said, “By this He means that He is able to do that.” The Imam (s) said, “Does He then make a promise which He will not fulfill?” Then how come He said, ‘…He adds to Creation as He pleases…’  And the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘Allah doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with Him is the Mother of the Book.’  Has He finished running the affairs?” Soleiman could not answer.Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! Does He know that a human being would be created while He did not will to create a human being by no means? That a human being will die today while He has not willed to make him die today?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) asked, “Does He know that what He wills exists or does He know about what He has not willed does not exist?” Soleiman said, “He knows that both of them exist.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Therefore, He knows that man is simultaneously alive and dead, is standing and sitting, is blind and seeing at the same time. This is impossible.” Soleiman said, “May I be your ransom! He knows that one of them will exist.”The Imam (s) said, “Do not worry. Which one will exist? The one which He willed, or the one which He did not will?” Soleiman said, “What He has willed to be!”Al-Ridha (s), Al-Ma’mun and the scholars started to laugh.Al-Ridha (s) said, “You have erred and departed from your initial statements, “He knows that some people will die today while He has not willed to make them die today, that He creates creatures while He does not will to create them.” If your hold that knowledge does not apply to what He has not willed, then He alone knows what He has willed.Soleiman said, “My statement is that Will is neither He nor something other than Him!”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Ignorant one! If you say that will is not He, then you have regarded it as (something) other than him. If you say that willis not (something) other than Him, then you have regarded it as Him.” Soleiman asked, “Does God know how He creates things?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Yes.” Soleiman said, “Surely, this establishes something.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “You have said something impossible. That is because man may know how to build a wall, even though he does not build one; may know how to sew, even though he does not sew anything; or may know how to make something well, even though he does not make it.”Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! Does God know that He is One without anything with Him?” Soleiman replied, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Does this establish that there is something along with Him?” Soleiman said, “He does not know that He is One without anything with Him.”Al-Ridha (s) asked, “Do you know that?”Soleiman replied, “Yes.”“O Soleiman! Therefore you are more knowledgeable than Him!” Soleiman said, “This is impossible.”The Imam (s) said, “Is it impossible in your view that He is One without anything with Him, that He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing, All-Wise, and All-Powerful?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (s) said, “Then how did the Honorable the Exalted God say that He was One, All-Living, All-Hearing, All-Seeing, All-Wise, All-Powerful, All-Knowing, All-Aware, while He did not know that? This refutes what you say. God is High Exalted above that.”Then Al-Ridha (s) asked him, “How does He will to create that which He does not know how to create and what it is? If a creator does not know how to create something before he creates it, then he is perplexed. The Sublime God is Exalted High above that!”Soleiman said, “Will is the same as Power.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “He - the Honorable the Exalted always has power over what He wills. There is no escape from that, for He - the Blessed the Sublime said, ‘If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent thee by inspiration…’  If will is the same as power, God had Willed to take it away because of His Power.” Then Soleiman remained silent.At this time Al-Ma’mun said, “O Soleiman! This is the most learned of the Hashemites!” Then the people dispersed.The author of this book (Sheikh Sadooq) - may God be pleased with him - said, “Al-Ma’mun was jealous of (the scholarly position of) Al-Ridha (s). Therefore, he invited the scholars of the various sects and religions who had deviated from the straight path and anyone he knew or had heard of around the globe to have debates with Al-Ridha (s) and defeat the Imam (s) in his (s) proofs, so that Al-Ma’mun’s feelings of jealousy be somewhat relieved and the Imam’s (s) scientific position be discredited. However, whoever held a debate with the Imam (s) acknowledged his (s) nobility and was convinced by the proofs presented by the Imam (s). This was because God - High be His Remembrance - did not like anyone to defeat Al-Ridha (s). God perfects His Light and assists His Proof. This is what the Blessed the Sublime God has promised in His Book, ‘We will, without doubt, help our apostles and those who believe, (both) in this world’s life…’  By ‘those who believe’, God means the Immaculate Imams, their knowledgeable followers and those who have adopted the Imams’ proof against their enemies for as long as they are in this world. God will treat them likewise in the Hereafter. The Honorable the Exalted God will never act against His Promise.",
    "arabicText": "حدثنا أبو محمد جعفر بن علي بن أحمد الفقيه رضي الله عنه قال :حدثنا أبو محمد الحسن بن محمد بن علي بن صدقه القمي قال : حدثنا أبو عمرو محمد بن عمرو بن عبد العزيز الأنصاري الكجي قال : حدثني من سمع الحسن بن محمد النوفلي يقول: قدم سليمان المروزي متكلم خراسان على المأمون فأكرمه ووصله، ثم قال له: إن ابن عمي علي بن موسى الرضا قدم علي من الحجاز - يحب الكلام - وأصحابه، فعليك أن تصير إلينا يوم التروية لمناظرته. فقال سليمان: يا أمير المؤمنين أني أكره أن أسأل مثله في مجلسك في جماعة من بني هاشم، فينتقص عند القوم إذا كلمني ولا يجوز الاستقصاء عليه. قال المأمون: إنما وجهت إليك لمعرفتي بقوتك، وليس مرادي إلا أن تقطعه عن حجة واحدة فقط. فقال سليمان: حسبك يا أمير المؤمنين! إجمع بيني وبينه، وخلني وإياه. فوجه المأمون إلى الرضا عليه السلام، فقال له: إنه قدم علينا رجل من أهل المرو، وهو واحد خراسان من أصحاب الكلام، فإن خف عليك أن تتجشم المصير إلينا فعلت. فنهض عليه السلام للوضوء ثم حضر مجلس المأمون، وجرى بينه وبين سليمان المروزي كلام في البداء بمعنى الظهور، لتغير المصلحة، واستشهد عليه السلام بآي كثيرة من القرآن على صحة ذلك، مثل قول الله: {يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ } [الروم: 11] و { يَزِيدُ فِي الْخَلْقِ مَا يَشَاءُ} [فاطر: 1] و {يَمْحُو اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيُثْبِتُ} [الرعد: 39]   و {وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِنْ مُعَمَّرٍ وَلَا يُنْقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ} [فاطر: 11] و {وَآخَرُونَ مُرْجَوْنَ لِأَمْرِ اللَّهِ } [التوبة: 106] وأمثال ذلك. فقال سليمان: يا أمير المؤمنين لا أنكر بعد يومي هذا البداء، ولا أكذب به إن شاء ال. فقال المأمون: يا سليمان اسأل أبا الحسن عما بدا لك وعليك بحسن الاستماع والإنصاف! قال سليمان: يا سيدي ما تقول فيمن جعل الإرادة اسما وصفة، مثل حي وسميع وبصير وقدير؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: إنما قلتم حدثت الأشياء واختلفت لأنه شاء وأراد، ولم تقولوا: (حدثت واختلفت) لأنه سميع بصير، فهذا دليل على أنها ليست مثل سميع وبصير ولا قدير. قال سليمان: فإنه لم يزل مريدا؟ قال: يا سليمان فإرادته غيره؟ قال: نعم. قال: قد أثبت معه شيئا لم يزل! قال سليمان: ما أثبت؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: أهي محدثة؟ قال سليمان: لا، ما هي محدثة! فأعاد عليه المسألة فقال: هي محدثة يا سليمان؟ فإن الشئ إذا لم يكن أزليا كان محدثا، وإذا لم يكن محدثا كان أزليا. قال سليمان: إرادته منه كما أن سمعه وبصره وعلمه منه. قال الرضا عليه السلام: فإرادته نفسه؟ قال: لا. قال: فليس المريد مثل السميع والبصير. قال سليمان: إنما إرادته كما سمع نفسه، وأبصر نفسه وعلم نفسه. قال الرضا عليه السلام: ما معنى أراد نفسه، أراد أن يكون شيئا، أو أراد أن يكون حيا، أو سميعا، أو بصيرا أو قديرا؟ قال: نعم. قال الرضا عليه السلام: أفبإرادته كان ذلك؟ قال سليمان: نعم. قال الرضا عليه السلام: فليس لقولك أراد أن يكون حيا سميعا بصيرا معنى، إذ لم يكن ذلك بإرادته. قال سليمان: بلى قد كان ذلك بإرادته، فضحك المأمون ومن حوله، وضحك الرضا عليه السلام، ثم قال لهم: ارفقوا بمتكلم خراسان! فقال يا سليمان: فقد حال عندكم عن حالة وتغير عنها، وهذا مما لا يوصف الله عز وجل به، فانقطع. ثم قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا سليمان أسألك عن مسألة؟. قال: سل جعلت فداك! قال: أخبرني عنك وعن أصحابك تكلمون الناس بما تفقهون وتعرفون، أو بما لا تفقهون وتعرفون؟ فقال: بل بما نفقهه ونعلم. قال الرضا عليه السلام: فالذي يعلم الناس أن المريد غير الإرادة، وأن المريد قبل الإرادة، وأن الفاعل قبل المفعول، وهذا يبطل قولكم: أن الإرادة والمريد شئ واحد. قال: جعلت فداك! ليس ذلك منه على ما يعرف الناس، ولا على ما يفقهون. قال: فأراكم ادعيتم على ذلك بلا معرفة، وقلتم: الإرادة كالسمع والبصر إذا كان ذلك عندكم على ما لا يعرف ولا يعقل. فلم يحر جوابا. ثم قال الرضا عليه السلام: هل يعلم الله تعالى جميع ما في الجنة والنار؟ قال سليمان: نعم. قال: فيكون ما علم الله عز وجل أنه يكون من ذلك؟ قال: نعم. قال: فإذا كان حتى لا يبقى منه شئ إلا كان أيزيدهم أو يطويه عنهم؟ قال سليمان: بل يزيدهم. قال: فأراه في قولك قد زادهم ما لم يكن في علمه أنه يكون. قال: جعلت فداك! فالمزيد لا غاية له. قال: فليس يحيط علمه عندكم بما يكون فيها إذا لم يعرف غاية ذلك، وإذا لم يحط علمه بما يكون فيهما لم يعلم ما يكون فيهما قبل أن يكون، تعالى الله عن ذلك علوا كبيرا. قال سليمان: إنما قلت لا يعلمه لأنه لا غاية لهذا لأن الله عز وجل وصفهما بالخلود، وكرهنا أن نجعل لهما انقطاعا. قال الرضا عليه السلام: ليس علمه بذلك بموجب لانقطاعه عنهم، لأنه قد يعلم ذلك ثم يزيدهم، ثم لا يقطعه عنهم، ولذلك قال عز وجل في كتابه: { كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ بَدَّلْنَاهُمْ جُلُودًا غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُوا الْعَذَابَ} [النساء: 56] وقال لأهل الجنة: {عَطَاءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ} [هود: 108] وقال عز وجل: {وَفَاكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ * لَا مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلَا مَمْنُوعَةٍ} [الواقعة: 32، 33] فهو عز وجل يعلم ذلك ولا يقطع عنهم الزيادة، أرأيت ما أكل أهل الجنة وما شربوا أليس يخلف مكانه؟ قال: بلى. قال: أفيكون يقطع ذلك عنهم وقد أخلف مكانه؟ قال سليمان: لا. قال: فكذلك كلما يكون فيها إذا أخلف مكانه فليس بمقطوع عنهم. قال سليمان: بلى. يقطعه عنهم ولا يزيدهم. قال الرضا عليه السلام: إذا يبيد ما فيها، وهذا يا سليمان إبطال الخلود، وخلاف الكتاب، لأن الله عز وجل يقول: {لَهُمْ مَا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ } [ق: 35] ويقول عز وجل: {عَطَاءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ} [هود: 108] ويقول عز وجل: {وَمَا هُمْ مِنْهَا بِمُخْرَجِينَ} [الحجر: 48] وبقول عز وجل: { خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا} [البقرة: 162] ويقول عز وجل: {وَفَاكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ * لَا مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلَا مَمْنُوعَةٍ } [الواقعة: 32، 33] فلم يحر جوابا. ثم قال الرضا عليه السلام: ألا تخبرني عن الإرادة فعل أم هي غير فعل؟ قال: بل هي فعل. قال: فهي محدثة لأن الفعل كله محدث! قال: ليست بفعل. قال: فمعه غيره لم يزل؟ قال سليمان: إن الإرادة هي الأشياء. قال: يا سليمان هذا الذي عبتموه على ضرار وأصحابه من قولهم: (أن كل ما خلق الله عز وجل في سماء أو أرض أو بحر أو بر من: كلب أو خنزير أو قرد أو إنسان أو دابة إرادة الله، وأن إرادة الله تحيى وتموت، وتذهب، وتأكل وتشرب، وتنكح، وتلد وتظلم، وتفعل الفواحش، وتكفر، وتشرك، فتبرأ منها وتعاديها وهذا حدها. قال سليمان: إنها كالسمع والبصر والعلم . قال الرضا عليه السلام: قد رجعت إلى هذا ثانية! فأخبرني عن السمع والعلم أمصنوع؟ قال سليمان. لا. قال الرضا عليه السلام: فكيف نفيتموه؟ فمرة قلتم لم يرد، ومرة قلتم أراد، وليس بمفعول له. قال سليمان: إنما ذلك كقولنا مرة علم ومرة لم يعلم. قال الرضا عليه السلام: ليس ذلك سواء لأن نفي المعلوم ليس ينفي العلم، ونفي المراد نفي الإرادة أن تكون، لأن الشئ إذا لم يرد لم تكون إرادة، وقد يكون العلم ثابتا وإن لم يكن المعلوم، بمنزلة البصر فقد يكون الإنسان بصيرا وإن لم يكن المبصر، ويكون العلم ثابتا وإن لم يكن المعلوم. فلا يزال سليمان يردد المسألة وينقطع فيها ويستأنف، وينكر ما كان أقر به، ويقر بما أنكر، وينتقل من شئ إلى شئ، والرضا صلوات الله عليه ينقض عليه ذلك، حتى طال الكلام بينهما، وظهر لكل أحد انقطاعه مرات كثيرة، تركنا إيراد ذلك مخافة التطويل، فآل الأمر إلى أن قال سليمان: إن الإرادة هي القدرة. قال الرضا عليه السلام: وهو عز وجل يقدر على ما لا يريد أبد الأبدين من ذلك لأنه قال تبارك وتعالى  : {وَلَئِنْ شِئْنَا لَنَذْهَبَنَّ بِالَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ} [الإسراء: 86] فلو كانت الإرادة هي القدرة كان قد أراد أن يذهب به لقدرته. فانقطع سليمان وترك الكلام عند هذا الانقطاع، ثم تفرق القوم.",

    "thaqalaynMatn": " Soleiman al-Marwazi, the most prominent religious scholar in Khorasan, went to see Al-Ma’mun. Al-Ma’mun honored him, granted him gifts and said, “My cousin Ali ibn Musa Al-Ridha (s) has come here from Hijaz. He likes theology and theologians. Thus it would not be any trouble if you came to hold adebate with him on the 8th of Dhul-Hajja (the Day of Tarwiyah) to have a debate with him.”Soleiman said, “O Commander of the Faithful! I dislike questioning him in your session and amongst a group of the Hashemites. The people will regard him as incapable when he debates with me on theology. Incapabilities are not permissible for him.”Al-Ma’mun said, “I have invited you because I know that you are learned (in theology). I have no intentions except for you to silence him in an argument.” Soleiman said, “O Commander of the Faithful! I will do it for you. Just bring us together. Just sit back and watch.”Then Al-Ma’mun sent someone after Al-Ridha (s) and said, “A man from Marwaz who is not equal to you in theology has come and asked for you to come to us. Come here if you do not mind.” The Imam (s) made ablutions and told us to go ahead. Imran As-Sa’ebee was with us. We went until we arrived at Al-Ma’mun’s court. Yasir and Khalid took my hands and led me in. When I got in and greeted (Al-Ma’mun), he asked, “Where is my brother Abul Hassan whom may the Sublime God maintain?” I said, “When we were coming he was putting on his clothes. He ordered us to go ahead.” Then I added, “O Commander of the Faithful! Your servant Imran is also with me. He is right outside.” He said, “Who is Imran?” I said, “He is the Sabian who became a Muslim because of you.” He said, “Let him in.” Then Imran came in. Al-Ma’mun welcomed him and then told him, “O Imran! You did not die and join the Hashemites!” Imran said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Praise be to God who honored me by you.” Al-Ma’mun said, “O Imran! This is Soleiman al-Marwazi who is the theologian from Khorasan.” Imran said, “O Commander of the Faithful! He thinks that he is the only one in Khorasan versed in theoretical principles and refutes origination (bida’). Al-Ma’mun said, “Why don’t you have a debate with him?” Imran said, “This depends on him.” Then Al-Ridha (s) came in and asked, “What were you discussing?” Imran said, “O son of the Prophet of God! This is Soleiman al-Marwazi.”Soleiman told Imran, “Will you be pleased with Abil Hassan (s) and what he says about origination. Imran said, “Yes, I will if he (s) presents arguments which I can present when I argue with other theologians like myself.”Al-Ma’mun said, “O Abul Hassan! What is your opinion regarding what they argue about?” The Imam (s) said, “O Soleiman! How could you not believe in origination while the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing?’  And the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘It is He Who begins (the process of) Creation; then repeats it…’  And says, ‘To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth…’  Moreover, the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘He adds to Creation as He pleases…’  and says, ‘…He began the Creation of man with (nothing more than) clay.’  Also the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘There are (yet) others, held in suspense for the command of God, whether He will punish them, or turn in mercy to them…’  And the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…Nor is a man long-lived granted length of days, nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Decree (ordained)…’ Soleiman asked, “Has anything been narrated to you on this issue from your forefather?” The Imam (s) said, “Yes. It has been narrated by my father on the authority of Abi Abdullah (s) who said, “The Honorable the Exalted God has two bodies of knowledge: a Treasured Knowledge, Hidden Knowledge which no one but Him is informed of. Origination is rooted in that knowledge. And He has a second knowledge which He has taught the angels and His Messengers which the knowledgeable Members of the Holy Household are also aware of.”Soleiman said, “I would like you to present this from the Book of the Honorable the Exalted God.” The Imam (s) said, “The Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘So turn away from them: not thine is the blame.’  At first God wanted to destroy them. But then the Sublime God changed His mind and said, ‘But teach (thy Message) for teaching benefits the Believers.’ Soleiman said, “May I be your ransom! Tell me more.” Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “My father (s) informed me on the authority of his forefathers (s), on the authority of God’s Prophet (s) that the Honorable the Exalted God revealed to one of His Prophets to let one of the Kings know that God will take away his life at such and such a time. The Prophet (s) went to see the King and told him that. Then the King pleaded to God while he was on his bed and fell off of it. He said, “O Lord! Postpone my demise until I see my son grow up to undertake my affairs.” Then the Honorablethe Exalted God revealed to that Prophet (s), “Go to that King and inform him that I have decided to postpone his death. I have added fifteen years to his life.”The Prophet (s) said, “O Lord! You well know that I have never lied.” Then the Honorable the Exalted God revealed to him, “You are just an agent. Announce this to him. God is never questioned about what He does.” Then the Imam (s) turned towards Soleiman and said, “I think you have the same opinion as the Jews in this regard.” Soleiman said, “From this I seek refuge in God.” The Imam (s) said, “The Jews say, ‘God’s hand is tied up...’ They mean that God is finished working and is sitting back and does not Create anything else. But the Honorable the Exalted God has given them the following answer, ‘…Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the (blasphemy) they utter….’  I have also heard my father Musa ibn Ja’far (s) say the following when asked about Origination, ‘How could the people refute origination, and that God might procrastinate the affairs of some people for a decision regarding them?’”Soleiman asked, “Can you tell me for what has the following verse been revealed? ‘We have indeed revealed this (Message) in the Night of Power.’  The Imam (s) said, “O Soleiman! The Honorable the Exalted God will decide the destiny (of an individual) for one year including life or death, good or bad, and sustenance on the Night of Power. Whatever God destines on that night comes to be.” Soleiman said, “Now I understand. Please tell me more.”The Imam (s) said, “O Soleiman! Some of the affairs are up to the Honorable the Exalted God and what He wills. He can expedite what He wills and procrastinate what He wills. He can destroy what He wills. O Soleiman, Ali (s) said, “Knowledge is of two types: Knowledge which God has taught His angels and His Messengers - that which God has taught His angels and His Messengers will be done, and that which is hidden near Him and He has informed none of His creatures of it. It is by this knowledge which He expedites what He wills to expedite, procrastinates what He wills to procrastinate; destroys what He wills to destroy, and He stabilizes what He wills to stabilize.”Soleiman told Al-Ma’mun, “O Commander of the Faithful! From today on I will not refute Creation or deny it by God’s Will.” Al-Ma’mun said,“O Soleiman! Ask Abul Hassan whatever you wish. Just listen carefully and be fair.” Soleiman said, “O my Master! May I ask?” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Ask whatever you wish.”Soleiman said, “What is your view about someone who considers will to be a name - an attribute similar to ‘ living’, ‘hearing’, ‘seeing’, and ‘powerful’?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “You say that things were originated and became different because He so desired and willed. But you do not say that things were originated and became different because He is All-Hearing and All-Seeing. This is a proof that they (i.e. will and desire) are not similar to All-Hearing, All-Seeing, and All-Powerful.”Soleiman said, “He has always been willing.” The Imam answered him, “O Soleiman! Is His will something other than Him?”He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (s) said, “Then you have proved that there has always been something along with Him forever.” Soleiman said, “No, I have not.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Is will originated?” Soleiman said, “No. It is not.” Then Al-Ma’mun shouted at him and said, “O Soleiman! Are you showing obstinacy and giving vague answers to such a person as him. You must be fair. Don’t you see that people of intellect are sitting around you?” Then Al-Ma’mun said, “O Abul Hassan! Continue your debate on theology with him since he is the theologian of Khorasan.”Then the Imam asked him, “O Soleiman! Is it (the will) originated? Whatever is not Eternal is certainly originated. And if it is not originated it is Eternal.”Soleiman said, “His (Allah’s) will is (part) of Him just as His Hearing, His Sight and His Knowledge are (parts) of Him.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Did He will Himself?” Soleiman answered, “No.” The Imam (s) said, “Therefore, willing is not like the hearing and the seeing.” Soleiman said, “Surely, He willed Himself just as He heard Himself, saw Himself, and recognized Himself.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “What is the meaning of ‘He willed Himself’? Did He will to be a thing? Did He will to be All-Living, All-Hearing, All-Seeing or All-Powerful?”Soleiman said, “Yes.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Did that occur through His will?” Soleiman answered, ‘Yes.’ Al-Ridha (s) said, “Then your statement, ‘Hewilled to be All-Living, All-Hearing, and All-Seeing,’ does not make any sense since they were not done through His Will.” Soleiman said, “Yes. That was through His Will.”Then Al-Ma’mun and the people around him burst into laughter. Al-Ridha (s) laughed too and said, “Do not be too hard on the theologian from Khorasan. O Soleiman! “Do you think that He (i.e. Allah, the Exalted) has altered from state to state and changed due to it? This is something by which the Honorable the Exalted God cannot be described.” Soleiman remained silent.Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! May I ask you a question?”Soleiman said, “May I be your ransom! Ask.”The Imam (s) said, “Tell me about you and your companions: Do you debate with the people on theology according to what you understand and know or according to what you do not understand and do not know?” Soleiman said, “Yes! (We debate) according to what we understand and know.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “The thing which the people know is that the willing is different from the will. The willing exists before the will. The subject is before the object. This (statement) disproves your statement, ‘The willing and the willed are the same thing.’” Soleiman said, “May I be your ransom! This is not what the people know about and understand.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “I think that you have claimed to have the knowledge without having a true recognition of it and said, ’Willing is like hearing and seeing’ while this view is not based on knowledge or the intellect.” Soleiman could not answer.Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! Does God have knowledge of all those who are in Paradise and the Fire?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”The Imam (s) said, “Will what the Sublime God knows would be created in the future, actually be created?” Soleiman answered, “Yes.”The Imam (s) said, “If it is done to the extent that nothing else remains, can God add more to them or will He stop doing so?”Soleiman said, “He will add to them.” The Imam (s) said, “Then based on what you have said, God adds to them what He did not know would be created.” Then he added, “May I be your ransom! There is no limit foradding.” The Imam (s) said, “Then in your opinion His Knowledge does not encompass what is therein (in Paradise), since He does not know the limit of that which will be in Paradise. If His Knowledge does not encompass what is therein, then He would not know what will be there before they existed. The Honorable the Exalted God is Exalted High above that!”Soleiman said, “When I said God does not know about them it was because they have no limit and the Honorable the Exalted God Himself has described them as eternal. Therefore we do not want to assume an end for them.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “God’s Knowledge of them will not limit them. There are many instances of which He has knowledge, then He adds to them and does not take away what He has added to them. These are supported by the Words of the Honorable the Exalted God in His Book, ‘…as often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty…’  And He told the residents of Paradise, ‘…a gift without break.’  And the Honorable the Exalted said, ‘Whose season is not limited, nor (supply) forbidden?’ Therefore the Honorable the Exalted God knows about these and does not block them from accessing to what is added. Will He not replace what the residents of Paradise eat and drink?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”The Imam (s) said, “Has He stopped His Granting now that He has replaced the consumed foods and drinks?” Soleiman said, “No.”Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! Tell me about Will: Is it an action or not?”Soleiman said, “It is an action.”The Imam (s) said, “Therefore it is originated, for all actions are originated.” Soleiman said, “It is not an action.”The Imam (s) said, “Has there then been something else with Him who is eternal?” Soleiman said, “The Will is the same as bringing forth.”The Imam (s) said, “O Soleiman! This is exactly what you criticized Dirar and his companions of, saying that everything that the Honorable the Exalted God has created in the heavens, the Earth, the oceans or on land such as dogs, pigs, monkeys, humans or animals are God’s Will, and that God’s Will lives, dies, goes away, eats, drinks, marries, feels pleasure, oppresses, commits immoral acts, disbelieves, becomes a polytheist. We denounce this and oppose it. This is its limit.”Soleiman said, “It (i.e. will) is like hearing, seeing and knowledge.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “You just returned to what you said before. Tell me: Are hearing, seeing and knowledge made?”Soleiman said, “No.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “How do you then refute Will? You sometimes say that He did not will and sometimes you say that He willed, and that it (i.e. will) was not one of His actions.”Soleiman said, “Surely, that is like saying, He sometimes knows and sometimes does not know!”Al-Ridha (s) said, “That is not the same, for negating the known is not like negating knowledge; negating what is willed is (not like) negating the will, for if the thing is not willed, there will be no will. However, sometimes there is knowledge, but there may be no known thing. This is like seeing. Man may be able to see, but there may be nothing there for him to see. Likewise, there may be knowledge, but there is no known thing.” Soleiman said, “It (i.e. will) is made.” The Imam (s) said, “Therefore, it (will) is originated and is not like hearing and seeing, for hearing and seeing are not made, and it (will) is made.”Soleiman said, “It (will) is one of His eternal attributes.” The Imam (s) answered, “Therefore, man must be eternal, for his quality is eternal.”Soleiman said, “No, because He did not do it (will)”. Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Khorasani! How often you make mistakes! Are things not made according to His Will and Words?” Soleiman said, “No.” The Imam (s) said, “If things are not made according to His Will or Volition, His Command or His Practice, then how are they made? God is High Exalted above that!” Soleiman could not respond.Then Al-Ridha (s) asked, “Will you not tell me about these Words of the Honorable the Exalted God: ‘When We decide to destroy a population, We (first) send a definite order to those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress…’By ‘We decide’ does God mean that He creates His own Will?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”The Imam (s) answered him, “If He creates His own Will, then your statement that ‘Will is He Himself or is a part of him’ is futile, for it is not (possible) for Him to create Himself and God does not change His State. God is High Exalted above that.”Soleiman told him, “Yes.” The Imam (s) said, “Then if He originates the Will, what you said, “Will is the same as God Himself or a part thereof” is wrong since God does not originate Himself or change from His current state. God is High Exalted above that.”Soleiman asked, “By that He does not mean that He creates His own will?”The Imam (s) asked, “So what does He mean?”Soleiman said, “He means doing something.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Woe unto you! How many times have you repeated this issue? I told you that will is originated, since the action and the Creation of a thing is originated.”Soleiman said, “Then this has no meaning.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Do you then think that He describes Himself with will which has no meaning? If will has no eternal or originated meaning, then that will nullify your statement, “The Honorable the Exalted God has always been willing.” Soleiman said, “I mean to say that willing has been one of the eternal actions of the Sublime God.”The Imam (s) said, “Don’t you know that what is eternal cannot be made, originated and eternal at the same time?”Soleiman could not answer. Al-Ridha (s) said, “Never mind! Complete your questions.” Soleiman said, “Did you say that Will is one of His Attributes?”The Imam (s) said, “Why do you repeat this so many times? Are His Attributes originated or eternal?” Soleiman said, “Originated.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “God is the Greatest! You are telling me that the Will is originated, even though it is one of His Eternal Attributes. Therefore God has not willed anything!” The Imam (s) added, “Whatever is eternal is not created.”Soleiman said, “Things are not the same as the will, and He did not will anything.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! You are whispering. Has God created what He has not willed to create? This is an attribute of someone who does not know what he is doing. God is High Exalted above that!”Soleiman said, “O my Master! I have already informed you that it is like hearing, seeing and knowing.”Al-Ma’mun said, “O Soleiman! Woe unto you! How often have you erred and how often have you have repeated yourself? Stop it and take up another issue since you seem to be unable to provide any better answer than that.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Leave him alone! Do not interrupt his questions, since then he will regard it as an argument (against me). O Soleiman! Speak.”Soleiman said, “I have already informed you that it is like hearing, seeing and knowing.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Never mind! Tell me whether will has one meaning or several meanings.” Soleiman said, “One meaning.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Is the meaning of all the wills then the same?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “If its meanings are the same, then it must be that the will to stand up is the same as the will to sit down, or the will to live isthe same as the will to die. If His Will is all one thing, then none of God’s desires will take precedence over any others. None will be any different from any others. They will all be one thing.”Soleiman replied, “Surely, the meanings are different.”The Imam (s) said, “Then, tell me about the willed. Is it the same as the will or is it something else?” Soleiman said, “Yes. It is the same as the will.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Then according to you the willed is something else since it is the same as the will.” Soleiman said, “O my Master! Will is not the same as the willed.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Then will is originated. Otherwise it must be that something else existed along with God. Understand this well. Continue on with your questions.”Soleiman said, “It is one of His Names.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Did He name Himself that?”Soleimam replied, “No. He did not name Himself that.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Therefore, you have no right to name Him with what He did not name Himself.” Soleiman said, “But He described Himself to be willed.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “The fact that He has described Himself as willed does not mean that He wanted to inform us that He is the Will, or that Will is one of His Names.” Soleiman said, “That is because His Will is the same as His Knowledge.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Ignorant one! If He knows something, does that not mean that He has willed it.” Soleiman said, “Yes.” The Imam (s) asked, “But if He does not will something, does that mean that He does not know it?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”The Imam (s) said, “What is your source for that statement? What is the evidence that His Will is the same as His Knowledge? He may know something but never Will it. This is supported by what the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent thee by inspiration…’ And God knows how to take it away, but He never will.” Soleiman said, “That is because He has finished running the affairs and will not add anything to what He has destined.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “This is what the Jews say. The Sublime God said, ‘…Call on Me; I will answer your (Prayer)…’ Soleiman said, “By this He means that He is able to do that.” The Imam (s) said, “Does He then make a promise which He will not fulfill?” Then how come He said, ‘…He adds to Creation as He pleases…’  And the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘Allah doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with Him is the Mother of the Book.’  Has He finished running the affairs?” Soleiman could not answer.Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! Does He know that a human being would be created while He did not will to create a human being by no means? That a human being will die today while He has not willed to make him die today?” Soleiman said, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) asked, “Does He know that what He wills exists or does He know about what He has not willed does not exist?” Soleiman said, “He knows that both of them exist.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “Therefore, He knows that man is simultaneously alive and dead, is standing and sitting, is blind and seeing at the same time. This is impossible.” Soleiman said, “May I be your ransom! He knows that one of them will exist.”The Imam (s) said, “Do not worry. Which one will exist? The one which He willed, or the one which He did not will?” Soleiman said, “What He has willed to be!”Al-Ridha (s), Al-Ma’mun and the scholars started to laugh.Al-Ridha (s) said, “You have erred and departed from your initial statements, “He knows that some people will die today while He has not willed to make them die today, that He creates creatures while He does not will to create them.” If your hold that knowledge does not apply to what He has not willed, then He alone knows what He has willed.Soleiman said, “My statement is that Will is neither He nor something other than Him!”Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Ignorant one! If you say that will is not He, then you have regarded it as (something) other than him. If you say that willis not (something) other than Him, then you have regarded it as Him.” Soleiman asked, “Does God know how He creates things?”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Yes.” Soleiman said, “Surely, this establishes something.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “You have said something impossible. That is because man may know how to build a wall, even though he does not build one; may know how to sew, even though he does not sew anything; or may know how to make something well, even though he does not make it.”Then Al-Ridha (s) said, “O Soleiman! Does God know that He is One without anything with Him?” Soleiman replied, “Yes.”Al-Ridha (s) said, “Does this establish that there is something along with Him?” Soleiman said, “He does not know that He is One without anything with Him.”Al-Ridha (s) asked, “Do you know that?”Soleiman replied, “Yes.”“O Soleiman! Therefore you are more knowledgeable than Him!” Soleiman said, “This is impossible.”The Imam (s) said, “Is it impossible in your view that He is One without anything with Him, that He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing, All-Wise, and All-Powerful?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (s) said, “Then how did the Honorable the Exalted God say that He was One, All-Living, All-Hearing, All-Seeing, All-Wise, All-Powerful, All-Knowing, All-Aware, while He did not know that? This refutes what you say. God is High Exalted above that.”Then Al-Ridha (s) asked him, “How does He will to create that which He does not know how to create and what it is? If a creator does not know how to create something before he creates it, then he is perplexed. The Sublime God is Exalted High above that!”Soleiman said, “Will is the same as Power.” Al-Ridha (s) said, “He - the Honorable the Exalted always has power over what He wills. There is no escape from that, for He - the Blessed the Sublime said, ‘If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent thee by inspiration…’  If will is the same as power, God had Willed to take it away because of His Power.” Then Soleiman remained silent.At this time Al-Ma’mun said, “O Soleiman! This is the most learned of the Hashemites!” Then the people dispersed.The author of this book (Sheikh Sadooq) - may God be pleased with him - said, “Al-Ma’mun was jealous of (the scholarly position of) Al-Ridha (s). Therefore, he invited the scholars of the various sects and religions who had deviated from the straight path and anyone he knew or had heard of around the globe to have debates with Al-Ridha (s) and defeat the Imam (s) in his (s) proofs, so that Al-Ma’mun’s feelings of jealousy be somewhat relieved and the Imam’s (s) scientific position be discredited. However, whoever held a debate with the Imam (s) acknowledged his (s) nobility and was convinced by the proofs presented by the Imam (s). This was because God - High be His Remembrance - did not like anyone to defeat Al-Ridha (s). God perfects His Light and assists His Proof. This is what the Blessed the Sublime God has promised in His Book, ‘We will, without doubt, help our apostles and those who believe, (both) in this world’s life…’  By ‘those who believe’, God means the Immaculate Imams, their knowledgeable followers and those who have adopted the Imams’ proof against their enemies for as long as they are in this world. God will treat them likewise in the Hereafter. The Honorable the Exalted God will never act against His Promise.",

    "englishText": "13. `Ali Ibn Ahmad Ibn Muhammad ibn `Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Muhammad ibn Abu `Abd Allah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Ismai`il al-Barmaki said: `Ali ibn al- `Abbas related to me that Isma`il ibn Mihran al-Kufi related to me on the authority of Isma`il ibn Ishaq al-Juhani, on the authority of Faraj ibn Farwah, on the authority of Mas`adah ibn Sadaqah, on the authority of Abu `Abd Allah that While the Commander of the Faithful (AS) was preaching from his pulpit in (the Mosque of) al-Kufah, a man stood up and said: “O Commander of the Faithful! Describe for us your Lord, Blessed and Exalted be He, so that we can increase our love and understanding of Him.” Hence, the Commander of the Faithful (AS) became angry, and called all to attend. Thus, the people gathered until the mosque was packed. Then he stood up, with his face flushed, and addressed the congregation as such: All praise be to Allah for Whom refusal to give does not enrich, and for Whom munificence does not make poor! All who give lose, expect He. He is full of beneficial bounties and plentiful gifts. All of creation depends on His Generosity for their sustenance. He has prepared the way for those who seek Him. He is as Generous when He is asked, as He is when He is not asked. Time does not affect Him as this would imply that He is subject to change. His Essence would not be affected, and His Wealth would not be diminished, even if He gave away all of the silver and all of the gold found in the mines in the mountains, and all of the pearls which the shells of the ocean produce for His Servants. His Wealth would remain great and unaffected, even if He answered the demands of every beggar because He is the Most Generous. Giving does not decrease His Wealth, not do the request of His Supplicants make Him miserly. His Command, when He intends anything, is only to say to it: Be, so it is.1 The Angels are incapable of approaching the nobility of His Throne. They are confused when they attempt to understand Him and the greatness of His Might and Majesty. Although they are close to His Realm, they know nothing about His Affair except what He informs them. They are so close to the sanctity of His Realm, that they recognize the limitations with which they were created saying: Glory be to Thee! We have no knowledge but that which Thou hast taught us; surely Thou art the Knowing, the Wise. Then what is your opinion, O questioner, about the One I have described in such terms? Praise and glory be to Him. He has no beginning, and is not subject to change. His Essence does not change states. Long stretches of day and night have no affect on Him. He originated the creation without any example which He could follow, and without any specimen prepared by any deity that was before Him. Attributes do no encompass Him so that we can comprehend Him, much less comprehend Him by means of limitations. He is Still. There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him. Exalted is He from the attributes of the created. Eyes cannot perceive Him so that He may be described by sight. His Essence is only known to Himself and cannot be recognized by His Creation. His Greatness surpasses the greatest conjectures of the most imaginative. He is Higher than anything that could be conceived by the feeble minds who seek to understand His Inner Greatness. He does not have a likeness. Nothing He creates is similar to Him. To the ones that recognize Him, He is above compeers and opponents. The ones who give partners to Allah are liars as they compare Him to their own kind. They embellish Him through their imaginations with the ornaments of creation. They divided Him in parts through speculation. They use their intellects to assess Him on the basis of creation, giving Him different strengths. How can this be done when it is impossible for the intellect to measure His Extent? Misleading dreams have gone astray in perceiving His Essence; because He is higher than the limits of human reasoning. Even the Angels, who are close to His Realm of Glory, cannot encompass Him. Exalted is He from having a parallel with which He may be resembled. He is the Subtle [al-Latif]. He prevents the imagination from finding Him in the depth of His Realm. He prevents the minds which are free from evil thoughts from comprehending His Being. He prevents the hearts who long to embrace His Attributes from going beyond description, and securing knowledge of His Divinity. He turns back those who cross the dark pitfalls of the unknown in their search for Him. Glorified be He! All those who seek to comprehend him return defeated, admitting that His Knowledge cannot be understood through such random efforts. They admit that not an iota of His Honor can enter the intellect of the greatest thinkers. They admit that He is far from the most powerful strengths of limited beings because He is other than His Creation. Therefore, He has no peer in His Creation.

Everything He created is His Proof, and is linked to Him. It is a silent creation, it is His Proof that speaks through planning. He has fixed limits for everything He has created and has set everything firm. He has put everything in its place through the gracefulness of His Planning. He has fixed the direction for everything. Nothing surpasses or falls shorts of the position He has willed. Nothing disobeys His Command to move, when He intends it to move. He does so without effort, and without challenge to His Order.

Know that he who describes our Sublime Lord by means of limbs and extremities knows nothing about His Nature. Verily, his heart did not profess with certainty that He is devoid of partners. It is as though he has not heard people renouncing their false gods by saying: By Allah! We were certainly in manifest error, when we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds.1 Whoever equates our Lord with anything has given Him a partner. Whoever gives Him a partner is an unbeliever as is stated in His Unambiguous verses, and as is indicated by His Clear Arguments. This is because Allah cannot be conceived by the limits of human intelligence. If He could be, He would be subject to change. Nor can Allah be conceived by means of intellectual efforts. If He could be, he would be limited, and an object subject t alteration. He is the Producer [al-Munshi’] who created everything without a need for imagination, without the urge of a hidden impulse, without any past experiment, and without the assistance of any partner who may have helped Him in creating wonderful things. Those who compare Him to His Creation divided Him into parts: some are limited, some vary in size, and others fall into different categories. He, the Mighty and High, Exists on His Own Accord, and is not dependent. People have not honored Him with the honor that He deserves. In order to demonstrate that He cannot be compared to His Creation, that He has no equals, and that He is far above the analogies of the unbelievers who give him limitations, He said: Any they have not honored Allah with the honor that is due to Him; and the whole Earth shall be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and heavens rolled up in His right hand; glory be to Him, and may He be exalted above what they associate (with Him).2 When describing Allah, limit your selves to the Divine Attributes which the Qur`an has provided, and seek light from the effulgence of its guidance. Leave to Allah that knowledge which Satan has prompted you to seek, and which neither the Qur`an enjoins you to seek, nor is there any trace of it in the actions or sayings of the Prophet and other Imams of Guidance. This is the extreme limit of Allah’s claim upon you. Know that those who are firm in knowledge refrain from opening through the veils of the unseen. The firm in knowledge, acknowledge their ignorance, and refuse to seek justification for their belief by means of the unseen. Hence, they say: We believe in it, it is all from our Lord.3 Allah, the Mighty and High praises them for admitting that they cannot obtain forbidden knowledge. They do not engage in deep discussions regarding the knowledge which is hidden from them and remain firm in their faith. Be content with this, and do not limit the Greatness of Allah on the basis of the limits of your own intelligence; otherwise, you will be destroyed.",

ليس كمثله شئ - عن صفة المخلوقين متعاليا  وانحسرت الأبصار عن أن تناله فيكون بالعيان موصوفا  وبالذات التي لا يعلمها إلا هو عند خلقه معروفا، وفات لعلوه على أعلى الأشياء مواقع رجم المتوهمين  وارتفع عن أن تحوي كنه عظمته فهاهة  رويات المتفكرين، فليس له مثل فيكون ما يخلق مشبها به  وما زال عند أهل المعرفة به عن الأشباه والأضداد منزها، كذب العادلون بالله إذ شبهوه بمثل أصنافهم  وحلوه حلية المخلوقين بأوهامهم، وجزوه بتقدير منتج خواطرهم  وقدروه على الخلق المختلفة القوى بقرائح عقولهم  وكيف يكون من لا يقدر قدره مقدرا في رويات الأوهام، وقد ضلت في إدراك كنهه هواجس الأحلام لأنه أجل من أن يحده ألباب البشر بالتفكير، أو يحيط به الملائكة على قربهم من ملكوت عزته بتقدير، تعالى عن أن يكون له كفو فيشبه به لأنه اللطيف الذي إذا أرادت الأوهام أن تقع عليه في عميقات غيوب ملكه، وحاولت الفكر المبرأة من خطر الوسواس إدراك علم ذاته  وتولهت القلوب إليه لتحوي منه مكيفا في صفاته  وغمضت مداخل العقول من حيث لا تبلغه الصفات لتنال علم إلهيته  ردعت خاسئة وهي تجوب مهاوي سدف الغيوب متخلصة إليه سبحانه، رجعت إذ جبهت معترفة بأنه لا ينال بجوب الاعتساف كنه معرفته  ولا يخطر ببال أولي الرويات خاطرة من تقدير جلال عزته لبعده من أن يكون في قوى المحدودين لأنه خلاف خلقه، فلا شبه له من المخلوقين  وإنما يشبه الشئ بعديله، فأما ما لا عديل له فكيف يشبه بغير مثاله، وهو البدئ الذي لم يكن شئ قبله، والآخر الذي ليس شئ بعده، لا تناله الأبصار من مجد جبروته إذ حجبها بحجب لا تنفذ في ثخن كثافته  ولا تخرق إلى ذي العرش متانة خصائص ستراته  الذي صدرت الأمور عن مشيته، وتصاغرت عزة المتجبرين دون جلال عظمته، وخضعت له الرقاب، وعنت الوجوه من مخافته  وظهرت في بدائع الذي أحدثها آثار حكمته  وصار كل شئ خلق حجة له ومنتسبا إليه  فإن كان خلقا صامتها فحجته بالتدبير ناطقة فيه، فقدر ما خلق، فأحكم تقديره، ووضع كل شئ بلطف تدبيره موضعه، ووجهه بجهة  فلم يبلغ منه شئ حدود منزلته  ولم يقصر دون الانتهاء إلى مشيته، ولم يستعصب إذ أمره بالمضي إلى أرادته، بلا معاناة للغوب مسه  ولا مكائدة لمخالف له على أمره  فتم خلقه، وأذعن لطاعته، ووافى الوقت الذي أخرجه إليه إجابة لم يعترض دونها ريث المبطئ ولا أناة المتلكئ  فأقام من الأشياء أودها (١) ونهى معالم حدودها، ولأم بقدرته بين متضادتها (٢) ووصل أسباب قرائنها (٣) وخالف بين ألوانها، وفرقها أجناسا مختلفات في الأقدار والغرائز والهيئات، بدايا خلائق أحكم صنعها، وفطرها على ما أراد إذ ابتدعها، انتظم علمه صنوف ذرئها، وأدرك تدبيره حسن تقديرها. أيها السائل إعلم من شبه ربنا الجليل بتباين أعضاء خلقه وبتلاحم أحقاق مفاصلهم المحتجبة بتدبير حكمته أنه لم يعقد غيب ضميره على معرفته (٤) ولم يشاهد قلبه اليقين بأنه لا ند له، وكأنه لم يسمع بتبري التابعين من المتبوعين وهم يقولون: ﴿تالله أن كنا لفي ضلال مبين إذ نسويكم برب العالمين﴾  فمن ساوى ربنا بشئ فقد عدل به، والعادل به كافر بما نزلت به محكمات آياته، ونطقت به شواهد حجج بيناته، لأنه الله الذي لم يتناه في العقول فيكون في مهب فكرها مكيفا، وفي حواصل رويات همم النفوس محدودا مصرفا  المنشئ أصناف الأشياء بلا روية احتاج إليها، ولا قريحة غريزة أضمر عليها، ولا تجربة أفادها من مر حوادث الدهور (١) ولا شريك أعانه على ابتداع عجائب الأمور، الذي لما شبهه العادلون بالخلق المبعض المحدود في صفاته، ذي الأقطار والنواحي المختلفة فطبقاته، و كان عز وجل الموجود بنفسه لا بأداته، انتفى أن يكون قدروه حق قدره (٢) فقال تنزيها لنفسه عن مشاركة الأنداد وارتفاعا عن قياس المقدرين له بالحدود من كفرة العباد: ﴿وما قدروا الله حق قدره والأرض جميعا قبضته يوم القيمة والسماوات مطويات بيمينه سبحانه وتعالى عما يشركون﴾  ما دلك القرآن عليه من صفته فاتبعه ليوصل بينك وبين معرفته  وأتم به  واستضئ بنور هدايته، فإنها نعمة وحكمة أوتيتهما فخذ ما أوتيت وكن من الشاكرين، وما دلك الشيطان عليه مما ليس في القرآن عليك فرضه ولا في سنة الرسول وأئمة الهدى أثره فكل علمه إلى الله عز وجل، فإن ذلك منتهى حق الله عليك. واعلم أن الراسخين في العلم هم الذين أغناهم الله عن الاقتحام في السدد المضروبة دون الغيوب فلزموا الاقرار بجملة ما جهلوا تفسيره من الغيب المحجوب فقالوا: (آمنا به كل من عند ربنا)  فمدح الله عز وجل اعترافهم بالعجز عن تناول ما لم يحيطوا به علما، وسمى تركهم التعمق في ما لم يكلفهم البحث عنه منهم رسوخا، فاقتصر على ذلك، ولا تقدر عظمة الله (سبحانه) على قدر عقلك فتكون من الهالكين.

    "thaqalaynSanad": "13. `Ali Ibn Ahmad Ibn Muhammad ibn `Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Muhammad ibn Abu `Abd Allah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Ismai`il al-Barmaki said: `Ali ibn al- `Abbas related to me that Isma`il ibn Mihran al-Kufi related to me on the authority of Isma`il ibn Ishaq al-Juhani, on the authority of Faraj ibn Farwah, on the authority of Mas`adah ibn Sadaqah, on the authority of Abu `Abd Allah that ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "While the Commander of the Faithful (AS) was preaching from his pulpit in (the Mosque of) al-Kufah, a man stood up and said: “O Commander of the Faithful! Describe for us your Lord, Blessed and Exalted be He, so that we can increase our love and understanding of Him.” Hence, the Commander of the Faithful (AS) became angry, and called all to attend. Thus, the people gathered until the mosque was packed. Then he stood up, with his face flushed, and addressed the congregation as such: All praise be to Allah for Whom refusal to give does not enrich, and for Whom munificence does not make poor! All who give lose, expect He. He is full of beneficial bounties and plentiful gifts. All of creation depends on His Generosity for their sustenance. He has prepared the way for those who seek Him. He is as Generous when He is asked, as He is when He is not asked. Time does not affect Him as this would imply that He is subject to change. His Essence would not be affected, and His Wealth would not be diminished, even if He gave away all of the silver and all of the gold found in the mines in the mountains, and all of the pearls which the shells of the ocean produce for His Servants. His Wealth would remain great and unaffected, even if He answered the demands of every beggar because He is the Most Generous. Giving does not decrease His Wealth, not do the request of His Supplicants make Him miserly. His Command, when He intends anything, is only to say to it: Be, so it is.1 The Angels are incapable of approaching the nobility of His Throne. They are confused when they attempt to understand Him and the greatness of His Might and Majesty. Although they are close to His Realm, they know nothing about His Affair except what He informs them. They are so close to the sanctity of His Realm, that they recognize the limitations with which they were created saying: Glory be to Thee! We have no knowledge but that which Thou hast taught us; surely Thou art the Knowing, the Wise. Then what is your opinion, O questioner, about the One I have described in such terms? Praise and glory be to Him. He has no beginning, and is not subject to change. His Essence does not change states. Long stretches of day and night have no affect on Him. He originated the creation without any example which He could follow, and without any specimen prepared by any deity that was before Him. Attributes do no encompass Him so that we can comprehend Him, much less comprehend Him by means of limitations. He is Still. There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him. Exalted is He from the attributes of the created. Eyes cannot perceive Him so that He may be described by sight. His Essence is only known to Himself and cannot be recognized by His Creation. His Greatness surpasses the greatest conjectures of the most imaginative. He is Higher than anything that could be conceived by the feeble minds who seek to understand His Inner Greatness. He does not have a likeness. Nothing He creates is similar to Him. To the ones that recognize Him, He is above compeers and opponents. The ones who give partners to Allah are liars as they compare Him to their own kind. They embellish Him through their imaginations with the ornaments of creation. They divided Him in parts through speculation. They use their intellects to assess Him on the basis of creation, giving Him different strengths. How can this be done when it is impossible for the intellect to measure His Extent? Misleading dreams have gone astray in perceiving His Essence; because He is higher than the limits of human reasoning. Even the Angels, who are close to His Realm of Glory, cannot encompass Him. Exalted is He from having a parallel with which He may be resembled. He is the Subtle [al-Latif]. He prevents the imagination from finding Him in the depth of His Realm. He prevents the minds which are free from evil thoughts from comprehending His Being. He prevents the hearts who long to embrace His Attributes from going beyond description, and securing knowledge of His Divinity. He turns back those who cross the dark pitfalls of the unknown in their search for Him. Glorified be He! All those who seek to comprehend him return defeated, admitting that His Knowledge cannot be understood through such random efforts. They admit that not an iota of His Honor can enter the intellect of the greatest thinkers. They admit that He is far from the most powerful strengths of limited beings because He is other than His Creation. Therefore, He has no peer in His Creation. Verily, things are compared to their equal. However, if something has no equal, how can it be compared with something which is completely different from it? He is the Originator who had nothing before Him, and He is the Last who has nothing after Him. Eyes cannot perceive Him due to the magnificence of His Power. Eyes are concealed with veils, and cannot penetrate their density. Eyes cannot penetrate the Veils of the Possessor of the Throne, and they cannot reach the One who Governs Everything through His Will. The pride of all tyrants cringes except the Majesty of His Greatness. All slaves surrender to Him, and all faces fear His Wrath. The signs of His Wisdom are apparent from everything He has created. Everything He created is His Proof, and is linked to Him. It is a silent creation, it is His Proof that speaks through planning. He has fixed limits for everything He has created and has set everything firm. He has put everything in its place through the gracefulness of His Planning. He has fixed the direction for everything. Nothing surpasses or falls shorts of the position He has willed. Nothing disobeys His Command to move, when He intends it to move. He does so without effort, and without challenge to His Order. Thus was completed the creation, and it bowed in obedience to Him. It was time for His creation to respond to Him. The laziness of any slug or the inertness of any excusefinder did not prevent them from doing so. So He straightened the curves of things, and completed the traces of their limits. With His Power He created coherence n their contradictory parts, and joined together the factors of similarity. Then He distinguished their colors, and separated them in varieties which differ in quantities, properties, and shapes. All of this was a new creation. He made them firm, shaped them as He intended, and invented them. Through His Knowledge He organized everything into species. His Planning perceives the splendor of its destiny. O questioner! Know that he who describes our Sublime Lord by means of limbs and extremities knows nothing about His Nature. Verily, his heart did not profess with certainty that He is devoid of partners. It is as though he has not heard people renouncing their false gods by saying: By Allah! We were certainly in manifest error, when we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds.1 Whoever equates our Lord with anything has given Him a partner. Whoever gives Him a partner is an unbeliever as is stated in His Unambiguous verses, and as is indicated by His Clear Arguments. This is because Allah cannot be conceived by the limits of human intelligence. If He could be, He would be subject to change. Nor can Allah be conceived by means of intellectual efforts. If He could be, he would be limited, and an object subject t alteration. He is the Producer [al-Munshi’] who created everything without a need for imagination, without the urge of a hidden impulse, without any past experiment, and without the assistance of any partner who may have helped Him in creating wonderful things. Those who compare Him to His Creation divided Him into parts: some are limited, some vary in size, and others fall into different categories. He, the Mighty and High, Exists on His Own Accord, and is not dependent. People have not honored Him with the honor that He deserves. In order to demonstrate that He cannot be compared to His Creation, that He has no equals, and that He is far above the analogies of the unbelievers who give him limitations, He said: Any they have not honored Allah with the honor that is due to Him; and the whole Earth shall be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and heavens rolled up in His right hand; glory be to Him, and may He be exalted above what they associate (with Him).2 When describing Allah, limit your selves to the Divine Attributes which the Qur`an has provided, and seek light from the effulgence of its guidance. Leave to Allah that knowledge which Satan has prompted you to seek, and which neither the Qur`an enjoins you to seek, nor is there any trace of it in the actions or sayings of the Prophet and other Imams of Guidance. This is the extreme limit of Allah’s claim upon you. Know that those who are firm in knowledge refrain from opening through the veils of the unseen.

    "englishText": "16. Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Muhammad Bin Al-Husayn, from Muhammad Bin Ismail Bin Yazi’e, from his uncle Hamza Bin Yazi’e and Al-Husayn Bin Muhammad Bin Al-Ashary, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Abdullah, from Yazeed Bin Abdullah, from the one who narrated to him said: ‘Abu Ja’far (asws) wrote to Sa’ad Al-Khayr: - In the Name of Allah (azwj), the Beneficent, the Merciful. Having said that, I (asws) hereby bequeath to you to fear Allah (azwj) for therein is safety from destruction and a gain during the returning (to Allah (azwj)). Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Protects the servant by means of his piety from whatever his intellect was remote from; and by means of piety he gets clarity from his blindness and his ignorance. And it was by piety that Noah (as) got salvation and those who were with him (as) in the ark got safety from the storm. And it was by piety that the patient ones succeeded and survived from the calamities, and they have brethren upon that path seeking those preferences, having renounced their insolence and their intentions by the desires when the examples from the Book reached them. They praised their Lord (azwj) on what He (azwj) has Sustained them with and that He (azwj) was the One (azwj) Deserving of the Praise, and they blamed their own selves upon what they had wasted and that they themselves were deserving of the condemnation. And they knew that Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, is the Forbearing, the Knowledgeable, however, He (azwj) is Angry on the one who does not care about His (azwj) Pleasure and (as a result) He (azwj) Withholds from the one who does not accept His (azwj) Favours, and but rather the one does not accept guidance from Him (azwj) goes astray. Then it is possible for the sinful people to turn to the repentance and change to the doing of good deeds. He (azwj) has Called His (azwj) servants in the Book to that with a Loud Voice. He (azwj) Never Cut-off nor Prevented the calling of His (azwj) servants. So Allah (azwj) has Cursed the ones who conceal what Allah (azwj) has Revealed, and Obligated upon Himself (azwj), the Mercy to be before the Wrath. So He (azwj) Completed the Truth and the Mercy, so there is no beginning for the servant with the Wrath before he arouses His (azwj) Anger, and that is from the knowledge of certainty and the knowledge of piety. And every community from whom Allah (azwj) has Raised the Knowledge from them (Taken away), the Knowledge of the Book is when they rejected it, and befriended His (azwj) enemies when they made them to be the rulers. And from their rejection of the Book was that they established its letters and distorted its Limits. So they were narrating it but were not acting upon it. And the ignorant ones were pleased with the preservation of the narrations, whereas the scholars became aggrieved at their abandonment of the correct aspects of the narrations. And from their rejection of the Book was that they made such people as rulers who did not know, so they took them (in a direction) of wherever their own desires led them, and released them to the death (ruination). They amended the ties of the Religion, and then they left it as a legacy among the foolish and the childish (people). So the community was issued with the commands devised by the people instead of the Commands of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, and it is to them that they referred to. So evil it was what the unjust took in exchange, the governance of the people instead of the Governance of Allah (azwj), and took the reward of the people instead of the Reward of Allah (azwj), and the pleasure of the people instead of the Pleasure of Allah (azwj). So this is how the community has become, and among them were those who strived (The Mujtahids) in the worship upon that misguidance. They (the people) were fascinated by them, and admired them, and their worship became a strife (Fitna) for them as well as those who followed them, whereas in the Messengers (as) there was a Reminder for the worshippers. Of these Prophets (as) was a Prophet (as) who was complete in his (as) worship, but then he (as) disobeyed Allah (azwj) Blessed and High in one aspect, so he (as) was exited from the Paradise, and he (as) was thrown into the belly of the whale. Then he (as) was not rescued until he (as) recognised (Al-Wilayah) and repented. So understand that there are similar ones to ‘Al-Ahbaar and Al-Rahbaan’ who go around concealing the Book, and alter it. So their business did not give them any gain and they were not of the guided ones. Then understand those that are similar to them in this community who establish the letters of the Book and alter its Limits. So they are with the chiefs and the notables, and when they disperse there are guided by the desires and they are with those who have a lot of the world (wealth), and that is what has reached to them from the knowledge. They do not cease to be like that in the copying (emulating) and the greed. The voice of Iblees (la) does not cease to be heard from their tongues with the falsehood, a great deal. The scholars observe patience from them from the harm that they (asws) suffer and their bullying, whereas they themselves blame the scholars for having burdened them. And the scholars in themselves are disloyal for having concealed the advice when they see a lost and strayed one with no guidance to him, or for not having revived a dead one. So evil it is what they do because Allah (azwj) Blessed and High has Taken a Covenant to them in the Book that they would enjoin the doing of good and by what He (azwj) has Ordered for, and forbid them from what He (azwj) has Forbidden them from, and that they would help each other upon the goodness, and the piety, and will not co-operate upon the sins and the animosity. So the scholars are in a struggle in their efforts from the ignorant ones, that if they give good advice, the people would say that they have transgressed. And if they come to know the truth which they had avoided, they would say that they have opposed. And if they quit they would say that they have separated, and they say, ‘Give us your proof on what you are narrating’, they would say that they have become hypocrites, and if they obey them, they would say that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has been disobeyed. So the ignorant ones are destroyed in what they do not know, unlettered in what they recite. They ratify the Book when it is defined and deny it in its altered state (Meaning they accept the present altered one and reject the original one which they consider to be the altered one), and so they are not deniers as such. They are similar to Al-Ahbaar and Al-Rahbaan, leaders in matters of desires and chiefs in matters of ruination, and others from among them are seated in between the misguidance and the guidance, not understanding one community from the other. They are saying that the people do not know this, not will they return to what it used to be. And they are right. The Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) left them upon the clarity, its night from its day. No innovations appeared among them, nor was the Sunnah changed among them. There was no opposition from them or differences among them. So what made the people to be covered in darkness of their errors (sins) is when two imams appeared, one (asws) calling to Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, and one calling to the Fire. At that time Satan (la) spoke in a loud voice by the tongues of his (la) friends and numerous were his horsemen, and infantry, and he included them in the wealth and the sons, the ones who associated with him (la). So they acted by the innovations, and avoided the Book and the Sunnah, whereas the Guardians (asws) of Allah (azwj) spoke by the Proof and took to the Book and the Wisdom. So from that day on, the people of the truth separated from the people of the falsehood. The people of guidance were abandoned and insulted, whilst the people of the misguidance helped each other until they became a group with so and so, and the like of him. So, understand this type, and the other type and look at them by the eyes of the excellent ones, and be firm with them until you come to your family, for the losers are the one who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Judgement. Indeed! That is the clear loss’. (Up to here is the report of Al-Husayn, and in the report of Muhammad Bin Yahya this is the extra bit). ‘They (people of the truth) know the path, if without them (asws) there are afflictions do not hold it against them (asws). If without them (asws) there is tyranny from the tyrannous people, and sinking of the earth and other afflictions, it will soon pass, then you will travel to the prosperity (through them (asws)). Then know that the reliable brothers are an ammunition, some of them for the other. Had it not been that you would leave from me (asws) due to your conjectures, I (asws) would have clarified for you certain things from the truth which I (asws) have kept covered, and would make public certain things from the truth which I (asws) have kept concealed, but I (asws) fear for you, and want you to remain (alive), and it is not for the forbearing person that he would not fear for anyone in the place of the piety, and the forbearance is the robe of the scholar, so do not be without it. ‘Salam’ (peace be with you)’.",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "16. Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Muhammad Bin Al-Husayn, from Muhammad Bin Ismail Bin Yazi’e, from his uncle Hamza Bin Yazi’e and Al-Husayn Bin Muhammad Bin Al-Ashary, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Abdullah, from Yazeed Bin Abdullah, from the one who narrated to him said: ‘Abu Ja’far (asws) wrote to Sa’ad Al-Khayr: -",
    "thaqalaynMatn": " In the Name of Allah (azwj), the Beneficent, the Merciful. Having said that, I (asws) hereby bequeath to you to fear Allah (azwj) for therein is safety from destruction and a gain during the returning (to Allah (azwj)). Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Protects the servant by means of his piety from whatever his intellect was remote from; and by means of piety he gets clarity from his blindness and his ignorance. And it was by piety that Noah (as) got salvation and those who were with him (as) in the ark got safety from the storm. And it was by piety that the patient ones succeeded and survived from the calamities, and they have brethren upon that path seeking those preferences, having renounced their insolence and their intentions by the desires when the examples from the Book reached them. They praised their Lord (azwj) on what He (azwj) has Sustained them with and that He (azwj) was the One (azwj) Deserving of the Praise, and they blamed their own selves upon what they had wasted and that they themselves were deserving of the condemnation. And they knew that Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, is the Forbearing, the Knowledgeable, however, He (azwj) is Angry on the one who does not care about His (azwj) Pleasure and (as a result) He (azwj) Withholds from the one who does not accept His (azwj) Favours, and but rather the one does not accept guidance from Him (azwj) goes astray. Then it is possible for the sinful people to turn to the repentance and change to the doing of good deeds. He (azwj) has Called His (azwj) servants in the Book to that with a Loud Voice. He (azwj) Never Cut-off nor Prevented the calling of His (azwj) servants. So Allah (azwj) has Cursed the ones who conceal what Allah (azwj) has Revealed, and Obligated upon Himself (azwj), the Mercy to be before the Wrath. So He (azwj) Completed the Truth and the Mercy, so there is no beginning for the servant with the Wrath before he arouses His (azwj) Anger, and that is from the knowledge of certainty and the knowledge of piety. And every community from whom Allah (azwj) has Raised the Knowledge from them (Taken away), the Knowledge of the Book is when they rejected it, and befriended His (azwj) enemies when they made them to be the rulers. And from their rejection of the Book was that they established its letters and distorted its Limits. So they were narrating it but were not acting upon it. And the ignorant ones were pleased with the preservation of the narrations, whereas the scholars became aggrieved at their abandonment of the correct aspects of the narrations. And from their rejection of the Book was that they made such people as rulers who did not know, so they took them (in a direction) of wherever their own desires led them, and released them to the death (ruination). They amended the ties of the Religion, and then they left it as a legacy among the foolish and the childish (people). So the community was issued with the commands devised by the people instead of the Commands of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, and it is to them that they referred to. So evil it was what the unjust took in exchange, the governance of the people instead of the Governance of Allah (azwj), and took the reward of the people instead of the Reward of Allah (azwj), and the pleasure of the people instead of the Pleasure of Allah (azwj). So this is how the community has become, and among them were those who strived (The Mujtahids) in the worship upon that misguidance. They (the people) were fascinated by them, and admired them, and their worship became a strife (Fitna) for them as well as those who followed them, whereas in the Messengers (as) there was a Reminder for the worshippers. Of these Prophets (as) was a Prophet (as) who was complete in his (as) worship, but then he (as) disobeyed Allah (azwj) Blessed and High in one aspect, so he (as) was exited from the Paradise, and he (as) was thrown into the belly of the whale. Then he (as) was not rescued until he (as) recognised (Al-Wilayah) and repented. So understand that there are similar ones to ‘Al-Ahbaar and Al-Rahbaan’ who go around concealing the Book, and alter it. So their business did not give them any gain and they were not of the guided ones. Then understand those that are similar to them in this community who establish the letters of the Book and alter its Limits. So they are with the chiefs and the notables, and when they disperse there are guided by the desires and they are with those who have a lot of the world (wealth), and that is what has reached to them from the knowledge. They do not cease to be like that in the copying (emulating) and the greed. The voice of Iblees (la) does not cease to be heard from their tongues with the falsehood, a great deal. The scholars observe patience from them from the harm that they (asws) suffer and their bullying, whereas they themselves blame the scholars for having burdened them. And the scholars in themselves are disloyal for having concealed the advice when they see a lost and strayed one with no guidance to him, or for not having revived a dead one. So evil it is what they do because Allah (azwj) Blessed and High has Taken a Covenant to them in the Book that they would enjoin the doing of good and by what He (azwj) has Ordered for, and forbid them from what He (azwj) has Forbidden them from, and that they would help each other upon the goodness, and the piety, and will not co-operate upon the sins and the animosity. So the scholars are in a struggle in their efforts from the ignorant ones, that if they give good advice, the people would say that they have transgressed. And if they come to know the truth which they had avoided, they would say that they have opposed. And if they quit they would say that they have separated, and they say, ‘Give us your proof on what you are narrating’, they would say that they have become hypocrites, and if they obey them, they would say that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has been disobeyed. So the ignorant ones are destroyed in what they do not know, unlettered in what they recite. They ratify the Book when it is defined and deny it in its altered state (Meaning they accept the present altered one and reject the original one which they consider to be the altered one), and so they are not deniers as such. They are similar to Al-Ahbaar and Al-Rahbaan, leaders in matters of desires and chiefs in matters of ruination, and others from among them are seated in between the misguidance and the guidance, not understanding one community from the other. They are saying that the people do not know this, not will they return to what it used to be. And they are right. The Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) left them upon the clarity, its night from its day. No innovations appeared among them, nor was the Sunnah changed among them. There was no opposition from them or differences among them. So what made the people to be covered in darkness of their errors (sins) is when two imams appeared, one (asws) calling to Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, and one calling to the Fire. At that time Satan (la) spoke in a loud voice by the tongues of his (la) friends and numerous were his horsemen, and infantry, and he included them in the wealth and the sons, the ones who associated with him (la). So they acted by the innovations, and avoided the Book and the Sunnah, whereas the Guardians (asws) of Allah (azwj) spoke by the Proof and took to the Book and the Wisdom. So from that day on, the people of the truth separated from the people of the falsehood. The people of guidance were abandoned and insulted, whilst the people of the misguidance helped each other until they became a group with so and so, and the like of him. So, understand this type, and the other type and look at them by the eyes of the excellent ones, and be firm with them until you come to your family, for the losers are the one who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Judgement. Indeed! That is the clear loss’. (Up to here is the report of Al-Husayn, and in the report of Muhammad Bin Yahya this is the extra bit). ‘They (people of the truth) know the path, if without them (asws) there are afflictions do not hold it against them (asws). If without them (asws) there is tyranny from the tyrannous people, and sinking of the earth and other afflictions, it will soon pass, then you will travel to the prosperity (through them (asws)). Then know that the reliable brothers are an ammunition, some of them for the other. Had it not been that you would leave from me (asws) due to your conjectures, I (asws) would have clarified for you certain things from the truth which I (asws) have kept covered, and would make public certain things from the truth which I (asws) have kept concealed, but I (asws) fear for you, and want you to remain (alive), and it is not for the forbearing person that he would not fear for anyone in the place of the piety, and the forbearance is the robe of the scholar, so do not be without it. ‘Salam’ (peace be with you)’.",

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Muhammad Bin Al-No’man, who has narrated the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) mentioned this sermon of Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) on the day of Friday : - ‘All Praise is for Allah (azwj) Who (azwj) is Deserving of all Praise and is the Guardian of it, and all Praise ends to Him (azwj) in its rightful place, the Initiator, and Inventor, the Majestic, the Magnificent, the Mighty, the Benevolent, the only One for the Greatness, and the Unique One for the Highness, the Omnipotent with Esteem, and the Overcomer by His (azwj) Omnipotence, the Preventer by His (azwj) Force, the Dominant by His (azwj) Power, Higher than everything by His (azwj) Compulsiveness, the Praised One by His (azwj) Gratitude and by His (azwj) Favours, the Provider by His (azwj) Gifts, and excessive Benefits, the Expansive in His (azwj) Sustenance, the Bestower by His (azwj) Bounties. We Praise Him (azwj) for His (azwj) Bounties and apparent Blessings, with a Praise weighed by His (azwj) Greatness and His (azwj) Majesty, and filled by His (azwj) Blessings and Greatness. And I (asws) testify that there is no god except for Allah (azwj), One with no associates to Him (azwj), Who (azwj) was in His (azwj) Existence as Foremost and in His (azwj) Everlasting. Veiled from the creatures was His (azwj) Oneness, and His (azwj) Lordship, and His (azwj) being Eternal, and they were submitted to the continuance of time. And I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant, and His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and His (azwj) elite from His (azwj) creatures having Chosen him (saww) with His (azwj) Knowledge and Selected him (saww) for His (azwj) Revelation, and Relied upon him (saww) for His (azwj) Secret, and was Pleased with him (saww) for His (azwj) creatures, Assigned him (saww) for His (azwj) Great Command as a beacon for the Principles of His (azwj) Religion and a Program for His (azwj) Way, and an Opener for His (azwj) Revelation, as a Reason for the Door of His (azwj) Mercy. He (azwj) Sent him (saww) during a gap from the Messengers (as), and Guides from the Knowledge, and during fatigue from the differing and straying from the truth, and ignorance about the Lord (azwj), and denial of the Resurrection, and the Promise that He (azwj) Sent him (saww) to all the people as a Mercy to the Worlds by the Honourable Book which He (azwj) had Excelled it, and Detailed it, and Explained it, and Clarified it, and Strengthened it, and Preserved it from it being approached by the falsehood from its front and from its back. A Revelation from the Most Wise and Praised One (azwj). In it He (azwj) struck examples, and Gave therein Signs for the ones who have intellect. He (azwj) Permitted therein the Permissibles and Prohibited therein the Prohibitions, and Legalised therein the Religion for His (azwj) servants, Giving Excuses and Warnings so that they would become a Proof for the people to Allah (azwj) after the Messengers (as) and become a Preaching for a worshipping people. So he (saww) preached His (azwj) Message, and strived in His (azwj) Way, and worshipped Him (azwj) they were convinced. May Greetings of Allah (azwj) be upon him (saww) and his (saww) Progeny (asws), and submission to him (saww) be a lot of Peace. I (asws) advise you, O servants of Allah (azwj) to fear Allah (azwj) Who Began the affairs by His (azwj) Knowledge and to Him (azwj) is their journey tomorrow for its end. And in His (azwj) Hand is their extinction, and your extinction, and the expiration for your days, and the extermination of your allocated terms, and the cutting off of your terms. So, very shortly it would pass by you all just as it had left the ones who were before you all. Servants of Allah (azwj)! Make your striving in this world to provide from these short-lived days for the days of the Hereafter which are prolonged, for this is the house for the deeds and the Hereafter is the house for dwelling in, and the Recompense. So abandon it (the world), for deceived is the one who is deceived by its deception. Do not rely upon the world by attaching your hopes and become the ones who love it, the ones who covet it, the ones who are fascinated by it just like what Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[10:24] The likeness of this world’s life is only as water which We send down from the cloud, then the herbage of the earth of which men and cattle eat grows luxuriantly thereby, until when the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes garnished, and its people think that they have power over it, Our command comes to it, by night or by day, so We render it as reaped seed; produce, as though it had not been in existence yesterday; thus do We make clear the communications for a people who reflect”. Along with that, a person never got experience in this world except that he inherited a lesson from it, nor did he wake up in the morning feeling secure except that he feared in it the descent of a catastrophe, or a change in bounties or a decline in health, with the death right behind that, and the trepidation of the Pausing in front of the Wise and Just One (azwj) Recompensing every soul with what it had done “[53:31] that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and (that) He may reward those who do good with goodness”. So fear Allah (azwj), Mighty is His (azwj) Mention, and hasten to the Pleasure of Allah (azwj), and the deeds with obedience to Him (azwj), and get closer to Him (azwj) with everything in which there is His (azwj) Pleasure for He (azwj) is Near and Answers. May Allah (azwj) Make us (asws) and you all of those who act towards His (azwj) Love and keep aside from His (azwj) Harshness. Then the best of the stories, and the best of the Advice, and the most beneficial of the Remembrance is the Book of Allah (azwj) Majestic and Mighty. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[7:204] And when the Quran is recited, then listen to it and remain silent, that mercy may be shown to you”. I (asws) seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) from the Satan (la) the castaway. In the Name of Allah (azwj) the Beneficent the Merciful “[103:1] I swear by the time, [103:2] Most surely man is in loss, [103:3] Except those who believe and do good, and enjoin on each other truth, and enjoin on each other patience”. “[33:56] Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation”. Our Allah (azwj)! Send Greetings upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww), and Blessings upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww), and yearning upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad, and Peace upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww) higher than what You (azwj) had Greeted, and Blessed, and Mercy, and Yearning, and Peace upon Ibrahim (as) and the Progeny of Ibrahim (as), You (azwj) are the Most Praised and Most Glorious’. Our Allah (azwj)! Grant to Muhammad (saww) the ‘الْوَسِيلَةَ’ Means, and the ‘الشَّرَفَ’ Dignity, and the ‘الْفَضِيلَةَ’ Preference, and the ‘الْمَنْزِلَةَ الْكَرِيمَةَ’ Honourable Status. Our Allah (azwj)! Make Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad to be the greatest of all creatures, all of them (asws) as Dignitaries on the Day of Judgement, the nearest to You (azwj) in seating, the most eminent of faces in Your (azwj) Presence on the Day of Judgement, the most prestigious and preferential in Your (azwj) Presence in status and share. Our Allah (azwj)! Grant to Muhammad (saww) the most Dignified of the status, and Bestow the Peace and intercession of Al-Islam. Our Allah (azwj)! And join us all with him (saww), without failure, or loss, or remorse or alteration. O Lord (azwj) of the ‘الْحَقِّ’ Just! Amen!’ Then he (asws) sat down for a while, then stood up and said: ‘The Praise is due to Allah (azwj) the One most deserving to be Awed and Praised, and the Foremost for the one who fears and worships, and the Highest for the one who Magnifies and Glorifies. We Praise Him (azwj) for His (azwj) Great Benevolence, and Excessive Grants, and apparent of His (azwj) Favours, and the goodness of His (azwj) Trials. And we believe in His (azwj) Guidance whose light does not get extinguished, nor does His (azwj) Extol be fully expressed, Whose Handle does not weaken. We seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) from the evil of every doubt, and the darkness of the strife, and we seek Forgiveness from the accumulation of the sins, and seek Protection from Him (azwj) from the wickedness of the deeds, and the detestable hopes, and the attacks of the terrors, and association with the people of the doubt, and the happiness with what the immoral ones do in the earth without having any right to do so. Our Allah (azwj)! Forgive us, and the Believing men and the Believing women, the living ones among them and the dead who You (azwj) have Made to die upon Your (azwj) Religion, and the Nation of Your (azwj) Prophet (saww). Our Allah (azwj), Accept their good deeds, and Overlook their sins, and Make Mercy to enter upon them, and the Forgiveness, and the Pleasure. And Forgive the living ones from the Believing men and the Believing women who believed in Your (azwj) Oneness, and ratified Your (azwj) Messenger (saww), and attached themselves to Your (azwj) Religion, and acted upon Your (azwj) Obligations, and followed Your (azwj) Prophet (saww), and made Your (azwj) Sunnah to be their Sunnah, and permitted for themselves Your (azwj) Permissibles, and Prohibited for themselves Your (azwj) Prohibitions, and feared Your (azwj) Punishment, and hoped for Your (azwj) Rewards, and befriended Your (azwj) friends, and were inimical to Your (azwj) enemies. Our Allah (azwj)! Accept their good deeds, and Overlook their sins, and Keep them, by Your (azwj) Mercy, with the righteous servants, O Lord (azwj) of the ‘الْحَقِّ’ Just. Amen!’",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "194. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Muhammad Bin Al-No’man, who has narrated the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) mentioned this sermon of Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) on the day of Friday : - ‘",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "All Praise is for Allah (azwj) Who (azwj) is Deserving of all Praise and is the Guardian of it, and all Praise ends to Him (azwj) in its rightful place, the Initiator, and Inventor, the Majestic, the Magnificent, the Mighty, the Benevolent, the only One for the Greatness, and the Unique One for the Highness, the Omnipotent with Esteem, and the Overcomer by His (azwj) Omnipotence, the Preventer by His (azwj) Force, the Dominant by His (azwj) Power, Higher than everything by His (azwj) Compulsiveness, the Praised One by His (azwj) Gratitude and by His (azwj) Favours, the Provider by His (azwj) Gifts, and excessive Benefits, the Expansive in His (azwj) Sustenance, the Bestower by His (azwj) Bounties. We Praise Him (azwj) for His (azwj) Bounties and apparent Blessings, with a Praise weighed by His (azwj) Greatness and His (azwj) Majesty, and filled by His (azwj) Blessings and Greatness. And I (asws) testify that there is no god except for Allah (azwj), One with no associates to Him (azwj), Who (azwj) was in His (azwj) Existence as Foremost and in His (azwj) Everlasting. Veiled from the creatures was His (azwj) Oneness, and His (azwj) Lordship, and His (azwj) being Eternal, and they were submitted to the continuance of time. And I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant, and His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and His (azwj) elite from His (azwj) creatures having Chosen him (saww) with His (azwj) Knowledge and Selected him (saww) for His (azwj) Revelation, and Relied upon him (saww) for His (azwj) Secret, and was Pleased with him (saww) for His (azwj) creatures, Assigned him (saww) for His (azwj) Great Command as a beacon for the Principles of His (azwj) Religion and a Program for His (azwj) Way, and an Opener for His (azwj) Revelation, as a Reason for the Door of His (azwj) Mercy. He (azwj) Sent him (saww) during a gap from the Messengers (as), and Guides from the Knowledge, and during fatigue from the differing and straying from the truth, and ignorance about the Lord (azwj), and denial of the Resurrection, and the Promise that He (azwj) Sent him (saww) to all the people as a Mercy to the Worlds by the Honourable Book which He (azwj) had Excelled it, and Detailed it, and Explained it, and Clarified it, and Strengthened it, and Preserved it from it being approached by the falsehood from its front and from its back. A Revelation from the Most Wise and Praised One (azwj). In it He (azwj) struck examples, and Gave therein Signs for the ones who have intellect. He (azwj) Permitted therein the Permissibles and Prohibited therein the Prohibitions, and Legalised therein the Religion for His (azwj) servants, Giving Excuses and Warnings so that they would become a Proof for the people to Allah (azwj) after the Messengers (as) and become a Preaching for a worshipping people. So he (saww) preached His (azwj) Message, and strived in His (azwj) Way, and worshipped Him (azwj) they were convinced. May Greetings of Allah (azwj) be upon him (saww) and his (saww) Progeny (asws), and submission to him (saww) be a lot of Peace. I (asws) advise you, O servants of Allah (azwj) to fear Allah (azwj) Who Began the affairs by His (azwj) Knowledge and to Him (azwj) is their journey tomorrow for its end. And in His (azwj) Hand is their extinction, and your extinction, and the expiration for your days, and the extermination of your allocated terms, and the cutting off of your terms. So, very shortly it would pass by you all just as it had left the ones who were before you all. Servants of Allah (azwj)! Make your striving in this world to provide from these short-lived days for the days of the Hereafter which are prolonged, for this is the house for the deeds and the Hereafter is the house for dwelling in, and the Recompense. So abandon it (the world), for deceived is the one who is deceived by its deception. Do not rely upon the world by attaching your hopes and become the ones who love it, the ones who covet it, the ones who are fascinated by it just like what Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[10:24] The likeness of this world’s life is only as water which We send down from the cloud, then the herbage of the earth of which men and cattle eat grows luxuriantly thereby, until when the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes garnished, and its people think that they have power over it, Our command comes to it, by night or by day, so We render it as reaped seed; produce, as though it had not been in existence yesterday; thus do We make clear the communications for a people who reflect”. Along with that, a person never got experience in this world except that he inherited a lesson from it, nor did he wake up in the morning feeling secure except that he feared in it the descent of a catastrophe, or a change in bounties or a decline in health, with the death right behind that, and the trepidation of the Pausing in front of the Wise and Just One (azwj) Recompensing every soul with what it had done “[53:31] that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and (that) He may reward those who do good with goodness”. So fear Allah (azwj), Mighty is His (azwj) Mention, and hasten to the Pleasure of Allah (azwj), and the deeds with obedience to Him (azwj), and get closer to Him (azwj) with everything in which there is His (azwj) Pleasure for He (azwj) is Near and Answers. May Allah (azwj) Make us (asws) and you all of those who act towards His (azwj) Love and keep aside from His (azwj) Harshness. Then the best of the stories, and the best of the Advice, and the most beneficial of the Remembrance is the Book of Allah (azwj) Majestic and Mighty. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[7:204] And when the Quran is recited, then listen to it and remain silent, that mercy may be shown to you”. I (asws) seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) from the Satan (la) the castaway. In the Name of Allah (azwj) the Beneficent the Merciful “[103:1] I swear by the time, [103:2] Most surely man is in loss, [103:3] Except those who believe and do good, and enjoin on each other truth, and enjoin on each other patience”. “[33:56] Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation”. Our Allah (azwj)! Send Greetings upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww), and Blessings upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww), and yearning upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad, and Peace upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww) higher than what You (azwj) had Greeted, and Blessed, and Mercy, and Yearning, and Peace upon Ibrahim (as) and the Progeny of Ibrahim (as), You (azwj) are the Most Praised and Most Glorious’. Our Allah (azwj)! Grant to Muhammad (saww) the ‘الْوَسِيلَةَ’ Means, and the ‘الشَّرَفَ’ Dignity, and the ‘الْفَضِيلَةَ’ Preference, and the ‘الْمَنْزِلَةَ الْكَرِيمَةَ’ Honourable Status. Our Allah (azwj)! Make Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad to be the greatest of all creatures, all of them (asws) as Dignitaries on the Day of Judgement, the nearest to You (azwj) in seating, the most eminent of faces in Your (azwj) Presence on the Day of Judgement, the most prestigious and preferential in Your (azwj) Presence in status and share. Our Allah (azwj)! Grant to Muhammad (saww) the most Dignified of the status, and Bestow the Peace and intercession of Al-Islam. Our Allah (azwj)! And join us all with him (saww), without failure, or loss, or remorse or alteration. O Lord (azwj) of the ‘الْحَقِّ’ Just! Amen!’ Then he (asws) sat down for a while, then stood up and said: ‘The Praise is due to Allah (azwj) the One most deserving to be Awed and Praised, and the Foremost for the one who fears and worships, and the Highest for the one who Magnifies and Glorifies. We Praise Him (azwj) for His (azwj) Great Benevolence, and Excessive Grants, and apparent of His (azwj) Favours, and the goodness of His (azwj) Trials. And we believe in His (azwj) Guidance whose light does not get extinguished, nor does His (azwj) Extol be fully expressed, Whose Handle does not weaken. We seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) from the evil of every doubt, and the darkness of the strife, and we seek Forgiveness from the accumulation of the sins, and seek Protection from Him (azwj) from the wickedness of the deeds, and the detestable hopes, and the attacks of the terrors, and association with the people of the doubt, and the happiness with what the immoral ones do in the earth without having any right to do so. Our Allah (azwj)! Forgive us, and the Believing men and the Believing women, the living ones among them and the dead who You (azwj) have Made to die upon Your (azwj) Religion, and the Nation of Your (azwj) Prophet (saww). Our Allah (azwj), Accept their good deeds, and Overlook their sins, and Make Mercy to enter upon them, and the Forgiveness, and the Pleasure. And Forgive the living ones from the Believing men and the Believing women who believed in Your (azwj) Oneness, and ratified Your (azwj) Messenger (saww), and attached themselves to Your (azwj) Religion, and acted upon Your (azwj) Obligations, and followed Your (azwj) Prophet (saww), and made Your (azwj) Sunnah to be their Sunnah, and permitted for themselves Your (azwj) Permissibles, and Prohibited for themselves Your (azwj) Prohibitions, and feared Your (azwj) Punishment, and hoped for Your (azwj) Rewards, and befriended Your (azwj) friends, and were inimical to Your (azwj) enemies. Our Allah (azwj)! Accept their good deeds, and Overlook their sins, and Keep them, by Your (azwj) Mercy, with the righteous servants, O Lord (azwj) of the ‘الْحَقِّ’ Just. Amen!’",

    "author": "Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq",
    "translator": "Basel Kadem",
    "englishText": "2.\tWe were told by Abu’l-Abbas, Muhammed bin Ibrahim bin Ishaq al-Talaqani, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Abu Ahmad, Qasim bin Muhammed bin Ali al-Haruni, that he said: We were told by Abu Hamid, Imran bin Musa bin Ibrahim, from Hasan bin Qasim al-Raqqam, that he said: I was told by Qasim bin Muslim, from his brother, Abdul-Aziz bin Muslim, that he said: We were with al-Rida, peace be upon him, in Merv, so we gathered in the mosque on Friday at the beginning of our arrival. Then they passed around the matter of Imamate  and they mentioned the amount of dispute among the people about it. Then I entered into the place of my Master, peace be upon him, and I informed him of the people’s discourse in that, so he, peace be upon him, smiled, then he said: O Abdul-Aziz, the people are ignorant and have been deceived about their religious beliefs. Indeed, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, did not take His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, until He completed for them the Religion, and He sent down unto him the Qur’an, in which is the detailing of everything and in which is the clarification of the permissible, the forbidden, the fixated punishments, the rulings and all which the people are in need of, completely, and He, Exalted and glorious is He, said: «We have not neglected in the Book anything» (6:38) and so He revealed during the farewell pilgrimage, which was during the last of the age of him, peace be upon him: «Today I have completed for you your Religion, fulfilled upon you My Grace and been pleased for you Islam as a Religion.» (5:3) Hence, the matter of the Imamate is among the completion of Religion, and he, peace be upon him, did not leave until he clarified to his nation the teachings of their religion and explained to them their path, and he left them after having made them aware of intending the path of truth, and he appointed for them Ali, peace be upon them, as a Banner and an Imam, and he did not leave anything which his nation is in need to, except that he clarified it. Thus, the one who claims that Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, did not complete His Religion, then he has rejected the Book of Allah, and the one who rejects the Book of Allah is a disbeliever. Do you know the value of the Imamate and its position from the nation by which it is permissible for them to make a choice? Indeed, the Imamate is more glorious rank, greater significance, higher place, more exclusive in involvement and more preventive of being hollow than for people to be able to reach it with their intellects or obtain with their opinions, or for them to assign an Imam by their choice. Indeed, the Imamate was specified by Allah for Ibrahim the Good Friend, peace be upon him, after Prophethood, and the being of a Good Friend is a third rank and position by which He had honored him and raised his remembrance, to which He, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «Indeed, I am making you, for the people, an Imam» (2:124) to which the Good Friend, peace be upon him, said, joyfully with it: «And from my offspring?» (2:124). Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, said: «My Covenant does not include the wrongdoers.» (2:124) Thus, this verse invalidated Imamate in every wrongdoer until the Day of Resurrection, and so, it became in the Chosen Ones. Furthermore, Allah honored him by making it in his offspring, the People of Choosing and Purity, and said: «And We granted to him Ishaq and Ya’qoub as an addition, everyone (of them) We made righteous, and We made them Imams who guide by Our commandment, and We revealed to them the doing of good deeds, the establishment of prayer and the giving of alms, and they were to Us, worsippers.» (21:72-73) It did not cease to be in his offspring, of which some inherited of others, generation by generation, until the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, inherited it, to which He, Glorified be His Glory, said: «Indeed, the people most worthy of Ibrahim are, verily, those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Ally of the believers.» (3:68) Hence, it was for him in particular, and then the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, appointed it to Ali, peace be upon him, by the commandment of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, in according to what Allah had obliged, and then it became in his Pure offspring whom Allah has given knowledge and faith, due to the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «And those who were the knowledge and faith said: You have, certainly, remained in the Book of Allah until the Day of Release» (30:56). Thus, it is in the sons of Ali, peace be upon him, exclusively, until the Day of Resurrection, as there is no Prophet after Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. So, from where do these ignorants choose the Imam? Indeed, the Imamate is the rank of Prophets and the inheritance of Successors. Indeed, the Imamate is, verily, the Successorship of Allah, the Successorship of the Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, the position of the Commander of the Believers and the inheritance of Hasan and Hussain, peace be upon them both, due to the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: « And those who were the knowledge and faith said» (30:56). Indeed, the Imamate is the Rope of the Religion, the System of the Muslims, the Uprightness of Material Affairs and the Honour of the Believers. Indeed, the Imamate is the growing basis of Islam and its sublime branch. With the Imam is the fulfilment of prayers, alms, fasting, pilgrimage, striving, the procurement of booty, charity, the carrying of fixated punishments, rulings and the prevention of frontiers and borders. The Imam permits that which Allah makes permissible, forbids what Allah makes forbidden, carries out the fixated punishments of Allah, defends the Religion of Allah and calls to the Path of his Lord with wisdom and good advice with the ultimate argument. The Imam is like the visible sun that shines with its light to the world while it is in the horizon in a manner it is not obtained by hands and vision. The Imam is the brightening full moon, the visible lamp, the plain light and the guiding star in the unseen dark, the plain land the and the deep of oceans. The Imam is the fresh water for the thirsty, the guide towards guidance, the driver away from destruction. The Imam is the fire above the hill that warms the one who warms himself, the guide in what makes one perish, he who separates from him, he is perished. The Imam is the raining cloud, the large-dropped rain, the brightening sun, the covering sky, the flattened earth, the abundant source, the stream and the garden. The Imam is the mild trustee, the compassionate father, the equivalent brother, the refuge of the servants during the calamity. The Imam is the Trustee of Allah among His creation, His Proof upon His servants, His Successor in His lands, the Caller to Allah and the Defender of the Sanctities of Allah. The Imam is the purified from sins, the innocent from blemishes, specified with knowledge, marked with forbearance, the System of Religion, the honor of the Muslims, the cause of rage to the hypocrites and the devastation of the hypocrites. The Imam is unique of his age, none is near to him, nor is a scholar even to him, nor is there to him any alternative, nor similar nor equal. He is specified with virtue, all of it, without any seek of it from him nor attempt of obtaining, but it is rather specified from One who bestows favor, a Granter. So, who is the one who reaches conscious knowledge of the Imam or who is able to choose him? May such be far! May such be far! Intellects have gone astray, dreams have gone lost, minds have become confused, eyes have longed, the great ones have become belittled, the wise have become confused, the forbearing have come short, the speakers have become tightened, the intellectuals have become dazed, the poets have become dimmed, the writers have become unable, and the eloquent have become incapable of describing one rank from his ranks or one virtue from his virtues, and so they acknowledged inability and short-doing. How can he be described, characterized by his nature, for it to be understood one thing from his matter or for anyone to stand in his place and to enrich with his richness? There is no «how» and «whereby» while he is like the star away from the hands of those who approach and the description of those who describe. So, where is choice with regards to this? And where are intellects from (ability to comprehend) this? And where is the like of this? Did they assume that this is among other then the Messenger’s Family? Their selves lied to them, by Allah, and they were made lost by falsehood, and so they elevated to a position of difficulty and slippery from which their feet slip to lowland. They sought to appoint the Imam with confused, dull and lacking intellects and aberrant opinions, and so they were not increased from him but with distance. May Allah destroy them! How are they deluded? They have, certainly, sought a difficult matter, uttered falsehood, aberred a distant aberration and fallen into confusion as they abandoned the Imam knowingly and Satan had beautified for them their acts, and so he repelled them from the path. They were conscious, having desired, other than the choice of Allah and the choice of His Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, to their choice, while the Qur’an calls for them: «And your Lord creates what He wishes and chooses. The choice was not for them. Glorified be Allah and Exalted is He above what they associate.» (28:68) And He said: «And it is not for a believing man nor a believing woman, if Allah and His Messenger decide a matter, that they have the choice in their matter.» (33:36) And He said: «What is it with you? How do you judge? Or do you have a book in which you learn, that indeed, for you is what you choose? Or do you have oaths upon Us, extending until the Day of Resurrection, that indeed, for you is to judge? Ask them which of them are, for that, claimers. Or do they have associates? Then let them bring their associates, if they were truthful.» (68:37-41) And He said: «Do they not contemplate on the Qur’an, or are their locks upon certain hearts?» (47:24) Or did Allah seal their hearts, and so they do not know? Or «They said: We wear, but they do not hear. Indeed, the worst living creatures for Allah are the deaf, the dumb, who do not use reason. And if Allah had knew in them any good, He would, verily, have made them hear, and if He had made them hear, they would, verily, turn away while they are refusing.» (8:21-23) Or: «They said: We have heard, and we disobey» (2:93). Rather, it is the favor of Allah which He gives to whom He wishes, and Allah is the One of Virtue, the Almighty. Hence, how is it for them to choose the Imam, when the Imam is knowledgeable who is not ignorant, a caller who does not deter, the core of holiness, purity, devoutness, ascetism, knowledge and worship? He is specified with the call of the Messenger, the progeny of the Pure, the Batul, there is no flaw in him with regards to lineage, nor is anyone with nobility near to him. The house is from Quraish, the prime is from Hashim, the Progeny is from the Family of the Messenger, the satisfaction is from Allah, the honor of all honors, the branch is from Abd Manaf, the one with growing knowledge, with complete rule, an expert in trust, knowledgeable in politics, to whom obedience is obligatory, rising with the order of Allah, an aid to the servants of Allah, a protector of the Religion of Allah. Indeed, the Prophets and Imams are given success by Allah, and He grants them from the Hidden of His Knowledge and Wisdom what He does not grant others, and so their knowledge is above the knowledge of the people of their age, in accordance to the saying of Him, Exalted is He: «So is He who guides to the truth more rightful to be followed, or he who does not guide, except that he is guided? So what is it with you? How do you judge?» (10:35) And His saying: «And he who is given wisdom, has, certainly, been given much good.» (2:269) And His saying about Talut: «Indeed, Allah chose him over you and increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His sovereignty to whom He wishes. And Allah is Encompassing, All-Knowing.» (2:247) And He said to His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: «He sent down unto you the Book and the wisdom, and He taught you what you did not know. And the favor of Allah upon you is ever great.» (4:113). And He said about the Imams from his Household, Progeny and Offspring, Allah’s blessings be upon him: «Or do they envy people for what Allah has granted them from His favor? For indeed, We have granted the Family of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We granted them a great kingdom. Then, among them were those who believed in him, and among them were those who drove away from it. And Hell is sufficient as a blaze.» (4:54-55) Indeed, if a servant is selected by Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, for the matters of His servants, He will expand his chest for that and entrust in his heart the wells of wisdom, and He will inspire to him knowledge, an inspiration, after which he will not be tired for an answer, nor will he be confused in it away from the correctness, while he is protected, assisted, given success and set firm, having been safeguarded from error, slipping and unintentional mistakes. He will be specified with that by Allah that he might be His Proof over His servants and His witness over His creation, and that is the favor of Allah, which He grants to whomever He wishes, and Allah is the One of great bestowal of favor. So, are they able to such as this? Or will their chosen be with this characteristic, by which they will put him forward? They have distanced, by the House of Allah, from the truth and discarded the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they do not know, whereas in the Book of Allah lies guidance and cure, but they discarded it and followed their desires, and so Allah condemned, detested them and made the miserable, so He, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «And who is more aberrant than the one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrong-doing people.» (28:50) And He said: «Hence, misery is for them, and their acts are aberrant.» (47:8) And He said: «Great is the detest in the sight of Allah and the sight of those who have believed. That is how Allah seals upon every arrogant, tyrannical, heart.» (40:35)",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "2.\tWe were told by Abu’l-Abbas, Muhammed bin Ibrahim bin Ishaq al-Talaqani, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Abu Ahmad, Qasim bin Muhammed bin Ali al-Haruni, that he said: We were told by Abu Hamid, Imran bin Musa bin Ibrahim, from Hasan bin Qasim al-Raqqam, that he said: I was told by Qasim bin Muslim, from his brother, Abdul-Aziz bin Muslim, that he said:",
    "thaqalaynMatn": " We were with al-Rida, peace be upon him, in Merv, so we gathered in the mosque on Friday at the beginning of our arrival. Then they passed around the matter of Imamate  and they mentioned the amount of dispute among the people about it. Then I entered into the place of my Master, peace be upon him, and I informed him of the people’s discourse in that, so he, peace be upon him, smiled, then he said: O Abdul-Aziz, the people are ignorant and have been deceived about their religious beliefs. Indeed, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, did not take His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, until He completed for them the Religion, and He sent down unto him the Qur’an, in which is the detailing of everything and in which is the clarification of the permissible, the forbidden, the fixated punishments, the rulings and all which the people are in need of, completely, and He, Exalted and glorious is He, said: «We have not neglected in the Book anything» (6:38) and so He revealed during the farewell pilgrimage, which was during the last of the age of him, peace be upon him: «Today I have completed for you your Religion, fulfilled upon you My Grace and been pleased for you Islam as a Religion.» (5:3) Hence, the matter of the Imamate is among the completion of Religion, and he, peace be upon him, did not leave until he clarified to his nation the teachings of their religion and explained to them their path, and he left them after having made them aware of intending the path of truth, and he appointed for them Ali, peace be upon them, as a Banner and an Imam, and he did not leave anything which his nation is in need to, except that he clarified it. Thus, the one who claims that Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, did not complete His Religion, then he has rejected the Book of Allah, and the one who rejects the Book of Allah is a disbeliever. Do you know the value of the Imamate and its position from the nation by which it is permissible for them to make a choice? Indeed, the Imamate is more glorious rank, greater significance, higher place, more exclusive in involvement and more preventive of being hollow than for people to be able to reach it with their intellects or obtain with their opinions, or for them to assign an Imam by their choice. Indeed, the Imamate was specified by Allah for Ibrahim the Good Friend, peace be upon him, after Prophethood, and the being of a Good Friend is a third rank and position by which He had honored him and raised his remembrance, to which He, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «Indeed, I am making you, for the people, an Imam» (2:124) to which the Good Friend, peace be upon him, said, joyfully with it: «And from my offspring?» (2:124). Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, said: «My Covenant does not include the wrongdoers.» (2:124) Thus, this verse invalidated Imamate in every wrongdoer until the Day of Resurrection, and so, it became in the Chosen Ones. Furthermore, Allah honored him by making it in his offspring, the People of Choosing and Purity, and said: «And We granted to him Ishaq and Ya’qoub as an addition, everyone (of them) We made righteous, and We made them Imams who guide by Our commandment, and We revealed to them the doing of good deeds, the establishment of prayer and the giving of alms, and they were to Us, worsippers.» (21:72-73) It did not cease to be in his offspring, of which some inherited of others, generation by generation, until the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, inherited it, to which He, Glorified be His Glory, said: «Indeed, the people most worthy of Ibrahim are, verily, those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Ally of the believers.» (3:68) Hence, it was for him in particular, and then the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, appointed it to Ali, peace be upon him, by the commandment of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, in according to what Allah had obliged, and then it became in his Pure offspring whom Allah has given knowledge and faith, due to the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «And those who were the knowledge and faith said: You have, certainly, remained in the Book of Allah until the Day of Release» (30:56). Thus, it is in the sons of Ali, peace be upon him, exclusively, until the Day of Resurrection, as there is no Prophet after Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. So, from where do these ignorants choose the Imam? Indeed, the Imamate is the rank of Prophets and the inheritance of Successors. Indeed, the Imamate is, verily, the Successorship of Allah, the Successorship of the Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, the position of the Commander of the Believers and the inheritance of Hasan and Hussain, peace be upon them both, due to the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: « And those who were the knowledge and faith said» (30:56). Indeed, the Imamate is the Rope of the Religion, the System of the Muslims, the Uprightness of Material Affairs and the Honour of the Believers. Indeed, the Imamate is the growing basis of Islam and its sublime branch. With the Imam is the fulfilment of prayers, alms, fasting, pilgrimage, striving, the procurement of booty, charity, the carrying of fixated punishments, rulings and the prevention of frontiers and borders. The Imam permits that which Allah makes permissible, forbids what Allah makes forbidden, carries out the fixated punishments of Allah, defends the Religion of Allah and calls to the Path of his Lord with wisdom and good advice with the ultimate argument. The Imam is like the visible sun that shines with its light to the world while it is in the horizon in a manner it is not obtained by hands and vision. The Imam is the brightening full moon, the visible lamp, the plain light and the guiding star in the unseen dark, the plain land the and the deep of oceans. The Imam is the fresh water for the thirsty, the guide towards guidance, the driver away from destruction. The Imam is the fire above the hill that warms the one who warms himself, the guide in what makes one perish, he who separates from him, he is perished. The Imam is the raining cloud, the large-dropped rain, the brightening sun, the covering sky, the flattened earth, the abundant source, the stream and the garden. The Imam is the mild trustee, the compassionate father, the equivalent brother, the refuge of the servants during the calamity. The Imam is the Trustee of Allah among His creation, His Proof upon His servants, His Successor in His lands, the Caller to Allah and the Defender of the Sanctities of Allah. The Imam is the purified from sins, the innocent from blemishes, specified with knowledge, marked with forbearance, the System of Religion, the honor of the Muslims, the cause of rage to the hypocrites and the devastation of the hypocrites. The Imam is unique of his age, none is near to him, nor is a scholar even to him, nor is there to him any alternative, nor similar nor equal. He is specified with virtue, all of it, without any seek of it from him nor attempt of obtaining, but it is rather specified from One who bestows favor, a Granter. So, who is the one who reaches conscious knowledge of the Imam or who is able to choose him? May such be far! May such be far! Intellects have gone astray, dreams have gone lost, minds have become confused, eyes have longed, the great ones have become belittled, the wise have become confused, the forbearing have come short, the speakers have become tightened, the intellectuals have become dazed, the poets have become dimmed, the writers have become unable, and the eloquent have become incapable of describing one rank from his ranks or one virtue from his virtues, and so they acknowledged inability and short-doing. How can he be described, characterized by his nature, for it to be understood one thing from his matter or for anyone to stand in his place and to enrich with his richness? There is no «how» and «whereby» while he is like the star away from the hands of those who approach and the description of those who describe. So, where is choice with regards to this? And where are intellects from (ability to comprehend) this? And where is the like of this? Did they assume that this is among other then the Messenger’s Family? Their selves lied to them, by Allah, and they were made lost by falsehood, and so they elevated to a position of difficulty and slippery from which their feet slip to lowland. They sought to appoint the Imam with confused, dull and lacking intellects and aberrant opinions, and so they were not increased from him but with distance. May Allah destroy them! How are they deluded? They have, certainly, sought a difficult matter, uttered falsehood, aberred a distant aberration and fallen into confusion as they abandoned the Imam knowingly and Satan had beautified for them their acts, and so he repelled them from the path. They were conscious, having desired, other than the choice of Allah and the choice of His Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, to their choice, while the Qur’an calls for them: «And your Lord creates what He wishes and chooses. The choice was not for them. Glorified be Allah and Exalted is He above what they associate.» (28:68) And He said: «And it is not for a believing man nor a believing woman, if Allah and His Messenger decide a matter, that they have the choice in their matter.» (33:36) And He said: «What is it with you? How do you judge? Or do you have a book in which you learn, that indeed, for you is what you choose? Or do you have oaths upon Us, extending until the Day of Resurrection, that indeed, for you is to judge? Ask them which of them are, for that, claimers. Or do they have associates? Then let them bring their associates, if they were truthful.» (68:37-41) And He said: «Do they not contemplate on the Qur’an, or are their locks upon certain hearts?» (47:24) Or did Allah seal their hearts, and so they do not know? Or «They said: We wear, but they do not hear. Indeed, the worst living creatures for Allah are the deaf, the dumb, who do not use reason. And if Allah had knew in them any good, He would, verily, have made them hear, and if He had made them hear, they would, verily, turn away while they are refusing.» (8:21-23) Or: «They said: We have heard, and we disobey» (2:93). Rather, it is the favor of Allah which He gives to whom He wishes, and Allah is the One of Virtue, the Almighty. Hence, how is it for them to choose the Imam, when the Imam is knowledgeable who is not ignorant, a caller who does not deter, the core of holiness, purity, devoutness, ascetism, knowledge and worship? He is specified with the call of the Messenger, the progeny of the Pure, the Batul, there is no flaw in him with regards to lineage, nor is anyone with nobility near to him. The house is from Quraish, the prime is from Hashim, the Progeny is from the Family of the Messenger, the satisfaction is from Allah, the honor of all honors, the branch is from Abd Manaf, the one with growing knowledge, with complete rule, an expert in trust, knowledgeable in politics, to whom obedience is obligatory, rising with the order of Allah, an aid to the servants of Allah, a protector of the Religion of Allah. Indeed, the Prophets and Imams are given success by Allah, and He grants them from the Hidden of His Knowledge and Wisdom what He does not grant others, and so their knowledge is above the knowledge of the people of their age, in accordance to the saying of Him, Exalted is He: «So is He who guides to the truth more rightful to be followed, or he who does not guide, except that he is guided? So what is it with you? How do you judge?» (10:35) And His saying: «And he who is given wisdom, has, certainly, been given much good.» (2:269) And His saying about Talut: «Indeed, Allah chose him over you and increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His sovereignty to whom He wishes. And Allah is Encompassing, All-Knowing.» (2:247) And He said to His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: «He sent down unto you the Book and the wisdom, and He taught you what you did not know. And the favor of Allah upon you is ever great.» (4:113). And He said about the Imams from his Household, Progeny and Offspring, Allah’s blessings be upon him: «Or do they envy people for what Allah has granted them from His favor? For indeed, We have granted the Family of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We granted them a great kingdom. Then, among them were those who believed in him, and among them were those who drove away from it. And Hell is sufficient as a blaze.» (4:54-55) Indeed, if a servant is selected by Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, for the matters of His servants, He will expand his chest for that and entrust in his heart the wells of wisdom, and He will inspire to him knowledge, an inspiration, after which he will not be tired for an answer, nor will he be confused in it away from the correctness, while he is protected, assisted, given success and set firm, having been safeguarded from error, slipping and unintentional mistakes. He will be specified with that by Allah that he might be His Proof over His servants and His witness over His creation, and that is the favor of Allah, which He grants to whomever He wishes, and Allah is the One of great bestowal of favor. So, are they able to such as this? Or will their chosen be with this characteristic, by which they will put him forward? They have distanced, by the House of Allah, from the truth and discarded the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they do not know, whereas in the Book of Allah lies guidance and cure, but they discarded it and followed their desires, and so Allah condemned, detested them and made the miserable, so He, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «And who is more aberrant than the one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrong-doing people.» (28:50) And He said: «Hence, misery is for them, and their acts are aberrant.» (47:8) And He said: «Great is the detest in the sight of Allah and the sight of those who have believed. That is how Allah seals upon every arrogant, tyrannical, heart.» (40:35)",

    "englishText": "2. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (ra) said:‬‬ ‫‪Muhammad ibn `Amr al-Katib, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ziyad al-Qalzumi, on the‬‬ ‫‪authority of Muhammad ibn Abu Ziyad al-Jiddi, the one who lead the prayers at Jiddah,‬‬ ‫‪that Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn `Umar ibn `Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) related to me that I heard‬‬ ‫‪Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) say this about the Unity (of Allah) in the presence of al-Ma`mum, Ibn Abu Ziyad said: their freed slave and maternal uncle to some of them,‬‬ ‫‪Ahmad ibn `Abd Allah al- `Alawi also related it to me, on the authority of al-Qasim ibn‬‬ ‫‪Ayyub al-`Alawi that‬‬: When al-Ma`mum wanted to appoint al-Rida (AS) to the Caliphate, he gathered the Hashemites and said: ”I want to appoint al-Rida as the Caliph after me.” The Hashemites envied him because of this and said: “Are you going to hand over political and religious authority to an ignorant man who has no idea of how to run the Caliphate? Have him summoned before us so that you can see his ignorance, and then you can judge what we affirm.” Therefore, he sent someone to summon him. The Hashemites said to him (AS): “O Abu al-Hasan! Go up to the pulpit, and give us an example of how we should serve Allah.” Hence he (AS) climbed up the pulpit, sat down, and lowered his head for some time without saying anything. He (AS) then rose up, stood up straight, praised Allah and extolled Him, and sent blessings on the Prophet and his Household (AS). \u003Cbr\u003EHe (AS) then said: The best of service is to acknowledge the existence of Allah. The foundation of acknowledgement of Allah is to process His unity. Allah’s Unity is established through the denial of descriptions, since all intellects bear witness that descriptions are created, and whatever is created requires a Creator, who is neither an identifier or identified. Every identifier and identified is connected, and connection is evidence of occurrence. Whatever occurs cannot be eternal. Hence, anyone who describes Allah in anthropomorphic terms has not described Allah’s Essence. Furthermore, anyone who describes Allah by means of reason has not described Him. Anyone who equates Him with anything has not described the Reality. Anyone who limits Allah has not recognized Him. Anyone who seeks to point Him out has not approached Him. Anyone who describes Allah in human terms has not described Him. Anyone who divides Allah into parts has not drawn near Him. And anyone who imagines Allah has intended other than Him. Everything which is known is in itself created. Every existence other than Him is caused. The existence of Allah is inferred through His Creation. The existence of Allah is acknowledged by means of the intellect. The existence of Allah is proven through nature. Allah placed the creation as a veil between the Creator and the created. Allah differs from creation by means of His Distinction. He gave a beginning to everything so that everything would know that He had no beginning, and so that everything would know that those who have a beginning are incapable of giving a beginning to others. He gave movement to everything so that everything would know that He is devoid of movement, because movement is a manifestation of need. His Names are interpretations. His Actions are instructions. His Essence is a fact. The Core of His Essence is a distinction between Him and His Creation. And His Elapses [ghubur] are limitations for all but Him. \u003Cbr\u003EVerily, whoever describes Allah is ignorant of Him. Anyone who attempts to encompass Him has totally missed Him. And anyone who thinks that He can be grasped in His Entirety has totally mistaken Him. Anyone who asks, “How is He?” has compared Him. Anyone who asks, “Why does He exist?” implies that He is caused. Anyone who asks, “How long has He existed?” has subjected Him to the limits of time. He who asks, “In what is He?” implies that He is contained. He who asks, “What is His Extent?” has limited Him. He who asks, “How far does He reach?” has raised Him, and whoever raises Him, implies that He has a limit. Whoever gives Allah an extent implies that He has parts. Whoever claims that Allah has parts has described Him. Whoever describes Him has disbelieved in Him. Allah is not subject to change like creation is subject to change. In the same way, He is not limited like the limitations of the limited. He is One, but not in the sense of a number. He is Apparent, but not in the sense of pursuit. He is Evident, but not in the sense of sight. He is Hidden, but not in the sense of pursuit. He is Far, but not in the sense of distance. He is Near, but not in the sense of closeness. He is Subtle, but not in the sense that He has a body. He is Existent, but not in the sense that He comes from non-existence. He is a Doer, but not by means of compulsion. He is the Appraiser, but not by means of thought. He is the Controller (of the Universe), buy not by means of movement. He is the One who Wills, but not by means of soliciting. He is the One who Wills, but not in the sense that He is eager. He is the Perceiver, but not by means of touch. He is All-Hearing, but not by means of any instrument. He is All-Seeing, but not by means of any tool. \u003Cbr\u003ETime cannot be associated with Him. Space does not contain Him. Slumber does not seize Him. Attributes do not limit Him. Tools do not bind Him. His Essence supersedes time. His Existence supersedes non-existence. His Eternity supersedes beginning. By giving senses to other, He proves that He is devoid of sense. By creating substance, He proves that He is not a substance. By giving contrasts, He proves that He has no contrast. By establishing pairs in creation, He proves that He has no partner. Light is the opposite of darkness like certainty is the opposite of uncertainty. Dryness is the opposite of wetness as cold is the opposite of heat. By creating similarity, Allah points out that He is the Creator. By creating difference, Allah points out that He is the Differentiator. As the Mighty and High has said: \"And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful.\" (51:49) Therefore, He differentiated between the prior and the subsequent to prove that nothing precedes Him, and that nothing succeeds Him. Everything that has an instinct bears witness that the One who gave them their instinct ha no instinct. Everything that is different bears witness that the One who made them different is devoid of differences. Everything that is subjected to time bears witness the One who subjected them to time is not subject to time. Everything that is veiled bears witness that the only veil which exists between them and the One who veiled them is themselves. \u003Cbr\u003EAllah was Lord even when there were no subjects. He was the One and Only True God even when no creation existed. He was All-Knowing even when there was nothing to be known. He was the Creator even before the creation existed. He was the All-Hearing even when there was nothing to be heard. He did not earn the title of Creator merely because of creation. He did not earn the title of Creator merely because he gave the created a beginning. And how could it be otherwise when the conjunction `since’ [mudh] does not make Him obscure? The word `may’ [qad] does not approach Him. The expression `perhaps’ [la`alla] does not veil Him. The conjunction `when’ [mata] does not set a time limit for Him. The expression `at the time when’ [hina] does not comprise Him. The word `with’ [ma`a] does not unite Him with anything. Verily, particles bind together, and tools point to things similar to themselves to show their effectiveness. The conjunction `since’ prevents Him from being without beginning. The word `may’ prevents Him from being eternal. The conjuction `if not’ [law la] prevents Him from being Complete; thus indicating division. Difference is manifest through opposition, making its Creator evident to the intellect while being concealed fro sight. When Allah is imagined, other than Him is imagined. Difference points to Him. Through difference, verification is introduced, and through difference, the intellect confirms the belief in Allah Through verification faith is complete. There is no profession of faith without recognition, and no recognition without sincerity. There is no sincerity in anthropomorphism. And there is no negation (of Truth) through the affirmation of anthropomorphism. \u003Cbr\u003EHence, whatever is found in creation is not found in the Creator, and whatever is possible in creation is impossible to the Creator. Motion and stillness do not occur in Him. And how can something He executed occur in Him? And how can something He originated return to Him? If this were the case, His Essence would have contrast, His Essential Being would be divided into parts, and He could not be called “without beginning.” And since the creator differs from the created, if He is restricted with the word `behind’ then He will be restricted with the word `in front.’ If you seek to complete Him, then you imply that He is deficient. How can He be Eternal if it is implied that He has a beginning? How can He give existence if He has been created? If any sign of creation exists in Him that would deny Him. If any sign of creation existed in Him, He would surely be subject to change. However, there is no evidence that He is subject to change. There are no answers to questions about Him. No reverence for Him can be found in meaning. There was no injustice in manifesting Himself to creation. The Eternal cannot be divided into “two” and the One without a Beginning cannot have a beginning. There is no god but Allah, the Greatest, and the Most High. Whoever gives partner to Allah is a liar, who is lead far astray, and who is in manifest loss. May Allah bless the Prophet Muhammad and His Noble and Pure Progeny!",
    "arabicText": "2 - حدثنا محمد بن الحسن بن أحمد بن الوليد رضي الله عنه، قال: حدثنا محمد بن عمر والكاتب، عن محمد بن زياد القلزمي ، عن محمد بن أبي زياد الجدي صاحب الصلاة بجدة، قال: حدثني محمد بن يحيى بن عمر بن علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام قال: سمعت أبا الحسن الرضا عليه السلام يتكلم بهذا الكلام عند المأمون في التوحيد، قال ابن أبي زياد: ورواه لي أيضا أحمد بن عبد الله العلوي مولى لهم وخالا (*) لبعضهم عن القاسم بن أيوب العلوي أن المأمون لما أراد أن يستعمل الرضا عليه السلام على هذا الأمر جمع بني هاشم فقال: إني أريد أن أستعمل الرضا على هذا الأمر من بعدي، فحسده بنو هاشم، وقالوا: أتولي رجلا جاهلا ليس له بصر  بتدبير الخلافة؟! فابعث إليه رجلا يأتنا فترى من جهله ما يستدل به عليه، فبعث إليه فأتاه، فقال له بنو هاشم: يا أبا الحسن اصعد المنبر وانصب لنا علما  نعبد الله عليه، فصعد عليه السلام المنبر، فقعد مليا لا يتكلم مطرقا، ثم انتفض انتفاضة . واستوى قائما، وحمد الله وأثنى عليه، وصلى على نبيه وأهل بيته. ثم قال: أول عبادة الله معرفته، وأصل معرفة الله توحيده، ونظام توحيد - الله تفي الصفات عنه  لشهادة العقول أن كل صفة وموصوف مخلوق  وشهادة كل مخلوق أن له خالقا ليس بصفة ولا موصوف، وشهادة كل صفة وموصوف بالاقتران، وشهادة الاقتران بالحدث، وشهادة الحدث بالامتناع من الأزل الممتنع من الحدث، فليس الله عرف من عرف بالتشبيه ذاته، ولا إياه وحده من اكتنهه  ولا حقيقة أصاب من مثله، ولا به صدق من نهاه  ولا صمد صمده من أشار إليه  ولا إياه عنى من شبهه، ولا له تذلل من بعضه، ولا إياه أراد من توهمه، كل معروف بنفسه مصنوع  وكل قائم في سواه معلول، بصنع الله يستدل عليه و بالعقول يعتقد معرفته، وبالفطرة تثبت حجته . خلق الله حجاب بينه وبينهم  ومباينته إياهم مفارقته إنيتهم، وابتداؤه إياهم دليلهم على أن لا ابتداء له لعجز كل مبتدء عن ابتداء غيره، وأدوه إياهم دليل على أن لا أداة فيه لشهادة الأدوات بفاقة المتأدين  وأسماؤه تعبير، وأفعاله تفهيم، وذاته حقيقة، وكنهه تفريق بينه وبين خلقه، وغبوره تحديد لما سواه  فقد جهل الله من استوصفه، وقد تعداه من اشتمله  وقد أخطأه من اكتنهه، ومن قال: كيف فقد شبهه، و من قال: لم فقد علله، ومن قال: متى فقد وقته، ومن قال: فيم فقد ضمنه، ومن قال: إلى م فقد نهاه، ومن قال. حتى م فقد غياه  ومن غياه فقد غاياه، ومن غاياه فقد جزأه، ومن جزأه فقد وصفه، ومن وصفه فقد ألحد فيه، لا يتغير الله بانغيار المخلوق، كما لا يتحدد بتحديد المحدود، أحد لا بتأويل عدد، ظاهر لا بتأويل المباشرة، متجل لا باستهلال رؤية، باطن لا بمزايلة، مبائن لا بمسافة، قريب لا بمداناة، لطيف لا بتجسم، موجود لا بعد عدم، فاعل لا باضطرار، مقدر لا بحول فكرة  مدبر لا بحركة، مريد لا بهمامة، شاء لا بهمة، مدرك لا بمجسة  سميع لا بآلة، بصير لا بأداة. لا تصحبه الأوقات، ولا تضمنه الأماكن، ولا تأخذه السنات  ولا تحده الصفات، ولا تقيده الأدوات  سبق الأوقات كونه. والعدم وجوده، والابتداء أزاله، بتشعيره المشاعر عرف أن لا مشعر له  وبتجهيره الجواهر عرف أن لا جوهر له، وبمضادته بين الأشياء عرف أن لا ضد له، وبمقارنته بين الأمور عرف أن لا قرين له ضاد النور بالظلمة، والجلاية بالبهم، والجسو بالبلل ، والصرد بالحرور، مؤلف بين متعادياتها، مفرق بين متدانياتها، دالة بتفريقها على مفرقها، وبتأليفها على مؤلفها، ذلك قوله عز وجل: (ومن كل شئ خلقنا زوجين لعلكم تذكرون)  ففرق بها بين قبل وبعد ليعلم أن لا قبل له ولا بعد، شاهدة بغرائزها أن لا غريزة لمغرزها، دالة بتفاوتها أن لا تفاوت لمفاوتها ، مخبرة بتوقيتها أن لا وقت لموقتها، حجب بعضها عن بعض ليعلم أن لا حجاب بينه وبينها غيرها  له معنى الربوبية إذ لا مربوب  وحقيقة الإلهية إذ لا مألوه  ومعنى العالم ولا معلوم، ومعنى الخالق ولا مخلوق، وتأويل السمع ولا مسموع  ليس منذ خلق استحق معنى الخالق، ولا باحداثه البرايا استفاد معنى البارئية  كيف  ولا تغيبه مذ، ولا تدنيه قد، ولا تحجبه لعل، ولا توقته متى، ولا تشمله حين، ولا تقارنه مع، إنما تحد الأدوات أنفسها، وتشير الآلة إلى نظائرها  وفي الأشياء يوجد فعالها  منعتها منذ القدمة، وحمتها قد الأزلية، وجبتها لولا التكملة  افترقت فدلت على مفرقها، وتباينت فأعربت من مباينها لما تجلى صانعها للعقول  وبها احتجب عن الرؤية، وإليها تحاكم الأوهام، وفيها أثبت غيره  ومنها أنيط الدليل  وبها عرفها الاقرار، وبالعقول يعتقد التصديق بالله، وبالاقرار يكمل الإيمان به، ولا ديانة إلا بعد المعرفة ولا معرفة إلا بالاخلاص، ولا إخلاص مع التشبيه، ولا نفي مع إثبات الصفات للتشبيه  فكل ما في الخلق لا يوجد في خالقه، وكل ما يمكن فيه يمتنع من صانعه، لا تجري عليه الحركة والسكون، وكيف يجري عليه ما هو أجراه، أو يعود إليه ما هو ابتدأه  إذا لتفاوتت ذاته، ولتجز أكنهه، ولامتنع من الأزل معناه، ولما كان للبارئ معنى غير المبروء، و لوحد له وراء إذا حد له أمام، ولو التمس له التمام إذا لزمه النقصان، كيف يستحق الأزل من لا يمتنع من الحدث، وكيف ينشئ الأشياء من لا يمتنع من الانشاء، إذا لقامت فيه آية المصنوع، ولتحول دليلا بعد ما كان مدلولا عليه، ليس في محال القول حجة  ولا في المسألة عنه جواب، ولا في معناه له تعظيم، ولا في إبانته عن الخلق ضيم، إلا بامتناع الأزلي أن يثنى وما لا بدأ له أن يبدأ ، لا إله إلا الله العلي العظيم، كذب العادلون بالله، وضلوا ضلالا بعيدا، وخسروا خسرانا مبينا، وصلى الله على محمد النبي وآله الطيبين الطاهرين.

    "englishText": "2. `Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn `Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Ya`qub alKulayni said: `Ali ibn Muhammad, said, on the authority Muhammad ibn `Isa, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Khalid that Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) said: May Allah bestow upon you knowledge of what is good! Know that Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is Eternal. Eternity is an attribute through which the wise understand that there was nothing before Him in eternity, and that there is nothing alongside Him in eternity. Even the common folk acknowledge that nothing existed before Allah, and that nothing exists alongside Him. At the same time, it invalidates the claim that there was something before Him. Had there been something eternal along with Him. He would not have been the Creator of that thing. If something existed along with Him, how then would He have been its Creator? Had there been something existing before Him, then that thing would have been worthier of being His Creator because it existed before Him. The blessed and Exalted ascribed certain names to Himself. When He created his creatures, He enabled them to serve Him, and told His creatures to call Him by those names. He called Himself the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Riser ]qa`im], the Manifest, the Hidden, the Subtle, the All-Aware, the Powerful, the Honorable, the All-Wise, and the All-Knowing, among other similar names. When the lying exaggerators [ghalun] heard us talk about such names, that there is nothing similar to Him, and that none of the creatures are like unto Him, they said: “When you say that there is nothing like unto Him, and nothing is similar to Him, then how can you share with Him His Most Beautiful Names, and apply them to yourselves? Thus, this is proof that you are similar to Him in all conditions or in some conditions because you share the same purified names.” It is said to them: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has named His Servants with some of His own Names but with differences in meaning just like one name may have two different meanings. The proof of this can be found among he common people. This is the way in which Allah, the Mighty and High, has addressed the creation. He has spoken to them by means of things that they understand so that the will have no excuse for their misdeeds. A man is sometimes called a dog, a donkey, a bull or a lion just like he can be called sweet or bitter. All of these words are used with a n allegorical meaning which differs from their literal meaning. A man cannot literally be a lion or a dog. Please pay close attention to this, May Allah have mercy on you! Verily, we say that Allah is AllKnowing, and not that He crated knowledge. It does not mean that He uses his Knowledge in order to record His Future Commands or His Process of Creation and Destruction because had that knowledge not been present that would imply ignorance or weakness. Likewise, the learned among creation are called knowledgeable because they possess created knowledge, which they did not have at some time in the past. They may lose their knowledge at some point and become ignorant again. However, Allah is called All-Knowing because He is not ignorant of anything. Thus, the Creator and the created are both called knowing, but the meaning is different as you have noticed.Our Lord is called All-Hearing. However, this is not through a body part or sensory organ without which He could not hear the sound as is the case with us. We cannot see with the part with which we hear. However, He has told us that no sound is hidden from Him. His hearing is not limited, as it is in our case. Here again the name hearing is used in both cases, but its meaning is different. The same applies for seeing. He does not see by means of an eye as we do. We see using a body part which serves that sole purpose. However, Allah is All-Seeing, and is never unaware of any individual. Again, the same name is used in both cases, but its meaning is different. He is Standing, but not in the sense of standing of His Les as would be the case for other beings. However, He informed us that He is Sanding, and that He is the Guardian. This is like the saying “A man is standing behind our affairs.” He is Standing behind every soul watching what is gains. As used by people, the word “standing” also has meanings like `sufficing.’ As you may say to a man, “Stand up for the affairs of so and so” which means to deal with them in a sufficient manner. Standing for us means that we stand on our legs. Therefore, the name is similar but its meaning is different. As for the term Subtle, it is Subtle, it is not used in the sense of smallness or being infinitesimal. Rather, it is used to express how difficult it is to perceive things. As an example, it may be said: “It has become very delicate for me,” and that “so and so is very delicate in his manners and dealings.” This means that it is profound for the intellect, and it is very difficult to understand. It has become so delicate that it cannot even be perceived by means of the imagination. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is far more Subtle than to be comprehended through definitions or be limited by an attribute in the way we are subtle, small and delicate. Names can be the same but they can differ in meaning. As for the All-Aware, it means that He is the One who Knows all Things, Completely, but not through study or experience, without which He would know nothing. One without experience and training is ignorant. Allah is always All-Aware of what He ha created. The people who are well are those people who are learning to overcome their ignorance. Thus, names are the same but again, they differ in meaning. As for the Manifest, it does not mean that He is over and above all things or sitting on the uppermost part of them. Rather, it refers to His Dominion and His Power over All Things. An example of this would be when a person says, “I overcame my enemies” or that “Allah granted me victory over my enemies.” In this case, there is a report of failure and victory. Thus, this shows Allah’s Dominion over all enemies.Another illustration that He is Manifest is that for those who intend Him, nothing is hidden form Him, and He is the Planner of all that can be seen. What can be clearer or more manifest than Allah, the Exalted? No matter where you look, His Presence will never vanish. Even within you, His Traces are sufficient proof for His Existence. However, what is manifested in us is apparent, and its limits are known. Therefore, the names are thee same, but their meanings differ. As for the Hidden, it does not mean that He is inside things. Rather, it refers to His Inner Knowledge of all things from their planning to their preserving. As one may say, “I tried to get to the inside of the matter,” that is, “I came to learn and discover his secrets.” For us, what is hidden is what is unseen and covered. Once again, the names are the same, but they differ in meaning. As for the Subduer, it does not refer to plotting, using certain devices, speaking seductive words, or using cunning means as some people do to subdue one another. The victorious among the people may become subdued, and vice versa. However, for Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,, all creatures are weak. Due to the absence of obstacles in what He wills for them, it takes less than a blinking of the eye for Him to say “Be and it is.” Subduing in our case is how I mentioned and explained. Thus, names are alike but their meanings differ. That is the case for all the names, although we have not mentioned all of them. We will suffice with this for learning purpose. May Allah be our Helper and your Helper assuring our guidance and success!",
    "arabicText": "2 - حدثنا علي بن أحمد بن محمد بن عمران الدقاق رحمه الله قال: حدثنا محمد بن يعقوب الكليني، قال: حدثنا علي بن محمد، عن محمد بن عيسى، عن الحسين ابن خالد، عن أبي الحسن الرضا عليه السلام أنه قال: إعلم - علمك الله الخير - أن الله تبارك وتعالى قديم، والقدم صفة دلت العاقل على أنه لا شئ قبله ولا شئ معه في ديموميته، فقد بان لنا بإقرار العامة مع معجزة الصفة لا شئ قبل الله ولا شئ مع الله في بقائه  وبطل قول من زعم أنه كان قبله أو كان معه شئ وذلك أنه لو كان معه شئ فبقائه لم يجز أن يكون خالقا له لأنه لم يزل معه: فكيف يكون خالقا لمن لم يزل معه، ولو كان قبله شئ كان الأول ذلك الشئ لا هذا، وكان الأول أولى بأن يكون خالقا للأول الثاني . ثم وصف نفسه تبارك وتعالى بأسماء دعا الخلق إذ خلقهم وتعبدهم وابتلاهم إلى أن يدعوه بها، فسمى نفسه سميعا بصيرا قادرا قائما ظاهرا باطنا لطيفا خبيرا قويا عزيزا حكيما عليما وما أشبه هذه الأسماء، فلما رأى ذلك من أسمائه الغالون المكذبون وقد سمعونا نحدث عن الله أنه لا شئ مثله ولا شئ من الخلق في حاله قالوا: أخبرونا إذ زعمتم أنه لا مثل لله ولا شبه له كيف شاركتموه في أسمائه الحسنى فتسميتم بجميعها؟! فإن في ذلك دليلا على أنكم مثله في حالاته كلها أو في بعضها دون بعض، إذ جمعتكم الأسماء الطيبة، قيل لهم: إن الله تبارك وتعالى ألزم العباد أسماء من أسمائه على اختلاف المعاني  وذلك كما يجمع الاسم الواحد معنيين مختلفين، والدليل على ذلك قول الناس الجائز عندهم الشائع، وهو الذي خاطب الله به الخلق وكلمهم بما يعقلون ليكون عليهم حجة في تضييع ما ضيعوا، وقد يقال للرجل: كلب وحمار وثور وسكرة وعلقمة وأسد، وكل ذلك على خلافه وحالاته  لم تقع الأسامي على معانيها التي كانت بنيت عليها، لأن الإنسان ليس بأسد ولا كلب، فافهم ذلك رحمك الله. وإنما نسمي الله بالعلم بغير علم حادث علم به الأشياء، واستعان به على حفظ ما يستقبل من أمره والروية فيما يخلق من خلقه، وبعينه ما مضى مما أفنى من خلقه مما لو لم يحضره ذلك العلم ويعنه كان جاهلا ضعيفا  كما أنا رأينا علماء الخلق أنما سموا بالعلم لعلم حادث إذ كانوا قبله جهلة، وربما فارقهم العلم بالأشياء فصاروا إلى الجهل  وإنما سمي الله عالما لأنه لا يجهل شيئا، فقد جمع الخالق والمخلوق اسم العلم  واختلف المعنى على ما رأيت، وسمى ربنا سميعا لا بجزء فيه يسمع به الصوت ولا يبصر به، كما أن جزءنا الذي نسمع به لا نقوى على النظر به، ولكنه أخبر أنه لا يخفى عليه الأصوات، ليس على حد ما سمينا نحن، فقد جمعنا الاسم بالسميع واختلف المعنى، وهكذا البصر لا بجزء به أبصر، كما أنا نبصر بجزء منا لا ننتفع به في غيره، ولكن الله بصير لا يجهل شخصا منظورا إليه، فقد جمعنا الاسم واختلف المعنى، وهو قائم ليس على معنى انتصاب وقيام على ساق في كبد كما قامت الأشياء  ولكن أخبر أنه قائم، يخبر أنه حافظ، كقولك: الرجل القائم بأمرنا فلان، وهو قائم على كل نفس بما كسبت، والقائم أيضا في كلام الناس الباقي، والقائم أيضا يخبر عن الكفاية، كقولك للرجل قم بأمر فلان أي اكفه، والقائم منا قائم على ساق، فقد جمعنا الاسم ولم يجمعنا المعنى، وأما اللطيف فليس على قلة وقضافة وصغر، ولكن ذلك على النفاذ في الأشياء  والامتناع من أن يدرك، كقولك لطف عني هذا الأمر، ولطف فلان في مذهبه وقوله يخبرك أنه غمض فبهر العقل وفات الطلب وعاد متعمقا متلطفا لا يدركه الوهم، فهكذا لطف الله، تبارك وتعالى عن أن يدرك بحد أو يحد بوصف، واللطافة منا الصغر و القلة، فقد جمعنا الاسم واختلف المعنى، وأما الخبير فالذي لا يعزب عنه شئ ولا يفوته شئ، ليس للتجربة ولا للاعتبار بالأشياء فيفيده التجربة والاعتبار علما لولاهما ما علم، لأن من كان كذلك كان جاهلا، والله لم يزل خبيرا بما يخلق والخبير من الناس المستخبر عن جهل المتعلم، وقد جمعنا الاسم واختلف المعنى، وأما الظاهر فليس من أجل أنه علا الأشياء بركوب فوقها، وقعود عليها، وتسنم لذراها، ولكن ذلك لقهره ولغلبته الأشياء ولقدرته عليها كقوله الرجل: ظهرت على أعدائي وأظهرني الله على خصمي، يخبر عن الفلج والغلبة، فهكذا ظهور الله على الأعداء . ووجه آخر أنه الظاهر لمن أراده، لا يخفى عليه شئ  وأنه مدبر لكل ما برأ، فأي ظاهر أظهره وأوضح من الله تعالى، وإنك لا تعدم صنعه حيثما توجهت، وفيك من آثاره ما يغنيك، والظاهر منا البارز بنفسه والمعلوم بحده، فقد جمعنا الاسم ولم يجمعنا المعنى، وأما الباطن فليس على معنى الاستبطان للأشياء بأن يغور فيها ولكن ذلك منه على استبطانه للأشياء علما وحفظا وتدبيرا، كقول القائل أبطنته، يعني خبرته وعلمت مكتوم سره، والباطن منا بمعنى الغائر في الشئ والمستتر به فقد جمعنا الاسم واختلف المعنى، وأما القاهر فإنه ليس على معنى علاج ونصب واحتيال ومداراة ومكر، كما يقهر العباد بعضهم بعضا، فالمقهور منهم يعود قاهرا، والقاهر يعود مقهورا، ولكن ذلك من الله تبارك وتعالى على أن جميع ما خلق ملتبس به الذل لفاعله وقلة الامتناع لما أراد به، لم يخرج منه طرفة عين غير أنه يقول له: كن فيكون، والقاهر منا على ما ذكرته ووصفت، فقد جمعنا الاسم واختلف المعنى، وهكذا جميع الأسماء وإن كنا لم نسمها كلها، فقد يكتفي للاعتبار بما ألقينا إليك، والله عوننا وعونك في إرشادنا وتوفيقنا.

    "thaqalaynSanad": "2. `Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn `Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Ya`qub alKulayni said: `Ali ibn Muhammad, said, on the authority Muhammad ibn `Isa, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Khalid that Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) said: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "May Allah bestow upon you knowledge of what is good! Know that Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is Eternal. Eternity is an attribute through which the wise understand that there was nothing before Him in eternity, and that there is nothing alongside Him in eternity. Even the common folk acknowledge that nothing existed before Allah, and that nothing exists alongside Him. At the same time, it invalidates the claim that there was something before Him. Had there been something eternal along with Him. He would not have been the Creator of that thing. If something existed along with Him, how then would He have been its Creator? Had there been something existing before Him, then that thing would have been worthier of being His Creator because it existed before Him. The blessed and Exalted ascribed certain names to Himself. When He created his creatures, He enabled them to serve Him, and told His creatures to call Him by those names. He called Himself the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Riser ]qa`im], the Manifest, the Hidden, the Subtle, the All-Aware, the Powerful, the Honorable, the All-Wise, and the All-Knowing, among other similar names. When the lying exaggerators [ghalun] heard us talk about such names, that there is nothing similar to Him, and that none of the creatures are like unto Him, they said: “When you say that there is nothing like unto Him, and nothing is similar to Him, then how can you share with Him His Most Beautiful Names, and apply them to yourselves? Thus, this is proof that you are similar to Him in all conditions or in some conditions because you share the same purified names.” It is said to them: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has named His Servants with some of His own Names but with differences in meaning just like one name may have two different meanings. The proof of this can be found among he common people. This is the way in which Allah, the Mighty and High, has addressed the creation. He has spoken to them by means of things that they understand so that the will have no excuse for their misdeeds. A man is sometimes called a dog, a donkey, a bull or a lion just like he can be called sweet or bitter. All of these words are used with a n allegorical meaning which differs from their literal meaning. A man cannot literally be a lion or a dog. Please pay close attention to this, May Allah have mercy on you! Verily, we say that Allah is AllKnowing, and not that He crated knowledge.

    "englishText": "20-1 Abul Abbas Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al-Taleqani - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Abu Ahmad Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Ali al-Haruni quoted on the authority of Sa’eed Al-Hussein ibn Ali al-Adawi quoted on the authority of Abu Hamid Imran ibn Musa ibn Ibrahim, on the authority of Al-Hassan ibn Al-Qasim Ar-Raqqam, on the authority of Al-Qasim ibn Muslim, on the authority of his brother Abdul Aziz ibn Muslim, “At the times of Ali ibn Musa Al-Ridha (s) we were in Marv. We had gathered together in the Jami’a mosque where the people were talking about the concept of Divine Leadership and the many differences which the people have with each other in that respect. I went to see my Master and my Friend Al-Ridha (s) and told him what the people said in that regard. He (s) smiled and said, ‘O Abdul Aziz! The people are ignorant and have been tricked regarding their religion. The Blessed the Sublime God did not take away the life of His Prophet (s) until after He perfected the religion for him and sent him the Quran in which everything including the allowed, the forbidden, the bounds, the decrees and everything which is needed is clarified. Then the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘…Nothing have we omitted from the Book…’ During the Farewell Pilgrimage, which was made in the last days of the Prophet’s (s) lifetime, God revealed to him, ‘…This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion…’ It is the issue of Divine Leadership which completes the religion. The Prophet (s) did not die until he (s) clarified the knowledge of their religion for them, showed them their way, put them on the straight path, established Ali (s) as their Guide and Divine Leader, and stated whatever the people needed. Whoever thinks that God has not completed His Religion has, in fact, denied God’s Book. Whoever denies God’s Book is an atheist. Are the people aware of the degree and worth of Divine Leadership and its rank amongst the nation so that their choosing a leader be acceptable? Divine Leadership is much more magnificent, nobler in status, higher in position and much more deep-rooted than to be understood by the intellect or views of the people so that they can elect a leader by themselves. Divine Leadership is what has been placed in the third rank by God after Prophethood and Friendship of God and granted to Abraham (s). God has given him great nobility by that and made him well-known.The Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘…I will make thee an Imam to the Nations…’ Then Abraham (s) got happy and said, ‘…And also (Imams) from my offspring!…’ Then the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers.’ Thus this verse will forever close any possibility of Divine Leadership for any oppressor up until the Resurrection Day. Therefore, Divine Leadership has been limited to the chosen ones. Then the Honorable the Exalted God honored him by establishing Divine Leadership for the chosen pure ones from Abraham’s (s) progeny. The Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, (a grandson), Jacob, and We made righteous men of every one (of them). And We made them Divine Leaders, guiding (men) by Our Command, and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to practice regular charity; and they constantly served Us (and Us only).’Thus Divine Leadership remained in his progeny from one generation to the next until the Prophet (s) inherited it. The Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘Without doubt, among men, the nearest of kin to Abraham, are those who follow him, as are also this Messenger and those who believe: And Allah is the Protector of those who have faith.’  Therefore, thisDivine Leadership was especially for the Prophet (s) and by God’s orders he (s) handed it down to Ali (s). It then remained in the hands of those of his (Ali’s) progeny who were chosen and who were granted knowledge and faith by God as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘But those endued with knowledge and faith will say, ‘Indeed ye did tarry, within Allah’s Decree, to the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection…’’  Therefore, Divine Leadership remains in the hands of the progeny of Ali (s) until the Resurrection Day since there will be no Prophets after Muhammad (s). Now how can these ignorant ones choose? Divine Leadership is the rank of the Prophets, and the Inheritance of the Trustees. Divine Leadership is the position of Vicegerency of the Honorable the Exalted God and vicegerency of the Prophet. It is the position of the Commander of the Faithful. It is the Inheritance of Al-Hassan (s) and Al-Hussein (s). Divine Leadership is the reign of religion, the order for the Muslims, the good of this world and the honor of the believers. Divine Leadership is the firm foundation of Islam and its greatest product.The perfection of the prayers, paying of the alms-tax, fasting, pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj), engaging in holy wars is done by the Divine Leader. The booties gained without any bloodshed, and charities are blessed by the Divine Leader. The Divine Doctrinal Provisions and the Punishments are put into practice by the Divine Leader, and the borders are safeguarded by him.The Divine Leader legalizes whatever God deems legal, forbids whatever God deems illegal, and executes the doctrinal provisions that God has decreed, protects the religion of God, and calls to the path of his Lord using wisdom, good advice, and strong proofs. The Divine Leader is like a brilliant sun in the world which is way out in the horizon out of the reach of the hands and the eyes. The Divine Leader is like a luminous full moon shining as a bright lamp and incident light, a guiding star in dark gloom, arid deserts and awesome oceans. The Divine Leader is like delicious water for the thirsty and like a guide to lead away from destruction. The Divine Leader is like the guiding fire on the desert highlands whose heat will warm the seekers of his warmth. He directs us out of dangers. Whoever abandons him will surely perish.The Divine Leader is like the raining clouds and the torrential downpour. He is like the shining sun and the vast land. He is like a gushing spring, a garden and a creek. The Divine Leader is like a trustworthy companion, a kind father and a real brother. He is like the shelter for the servants.The Divine Leader is the Trustee of God on His land. He is His Proof for His servants and His Vicegerent in His towns. He is the Caller to God, and the protector of the sanctities of the Honorable the Exalted God.The Divine Leader is purified from sins and free from defects, is given exclusive knowledge, is characterized with forbearance, is the order of the religion, is the Stronghold of the believers, is the cause of anger of the hypocrites, and the perdition of the unbelievers.The Divine Leader is the unsurpassed one in his own time. No one can catch up with him and no scholar can equal him. There is no substitute for him and there is no like or match for him. Perfect virtue is dedicated to him without him seeking it or acquiring it. Rather, it is dedicated to him by the Favorer the Endower God.How is it then possible for anybody to attain the true recognition of the Divine Leader? How impossible this is! Minds are too astray, intellects are too lost, wits are too perplexed, speakers are too mute, poets are too unversed, authors are too impotent, eloquent ones are too wordless, and scholars are too weak to describe a single feature or a single virtue of the features and virtues of the Divine Leader. Consequently, they all confess their shortcomings and inadequacies to do so. How is it then possible to describe him as a whole or portray his manners? How it is possible to find anyone who can act out his role or represent him? How is this possible while the Divine Leader is as far away as the stars are from the reach of the debaters and the describers? Then where does the choice of the people stand and where does this rank stand? Where are the intellects and how can this rank be understood? Where can anyone find such a person? Do they think they can find Divine Leadership in anyone outside of the Household of the Prophet (s)?By God, they are deceived by themselves and their false claims have led them into indulging in false hopes. They are surely climbing a rugged ascent and a slippery mount that will surely cause them to stumble to the rock bottom with wandering, insufficient, and impoverished intellects and deviating opinions, because they have intended to choose a DivineLeader on their own. They will only get farther away from where they intend to go. ‘The Curse of God be on them! How are they deluded ( away from the Truth)!’  They have decided to go along a difficult road. They have said false things. They ‘…have verily strayed far, far away from the Path…’  and do not know what to do since they have knowingly abandoned the Divine Leader. Satan adorned their deeds in their own sight and hindered them from following the right path while they were able to see. They have abandoned the choice of God and His Prophet ( s) and have considered their own choice. The Quran calls them and says, ‘Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they ( in the matter): Glory be to Allah. and far is He above the partners they ascribe ( to Him)!’ And the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘It is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if anyone disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path.’The Honorable the Exalted God also says, ‘What is the matter with you? How judge ye? Or have ye a book through which ye learn that ye shall have, through it whatever ye choose? Or have ye Covenants with Us to oath, reaching to the Day of Judgment, ( providing) that ye shall have whatever ye shall demand? Ask thou of them, which of them will stand surety for that!’The Honorable the Exalted God also says, ‘Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur’an, or are their hearts locked up by them?’  Or has God placed a seal on their hearts and they no longer understand. Or they say, ‘…We hear, but listen not.’ ‘For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf and the dumb - those who understand not. If Allah had found in them any good. He would indeed have made them listen: ( As it is), if He had made them listen, they would but have turned back and declined ( Faith).’ Then how could they nominate a Divine Leader while the true Divine Leader is one so versed in knowledge that ignorance never approaches him and is a custodian that never betrays? He is the mine of holiness, purity, worship, knowledge and servitude. In fact, the Prophet ( s) himself has especially called upon him to become the Divine Leader.The Divine Leader is from the progeny of the pure al-Batool (Fatima) (s). There are no flaws in this lineage. There are no honorable ones to equal him (i.e. the Divine Leader). He is from the Quraysh tribe. His clan is the Hashemites and his root is the Messenger of God (s). God is pleased with the Divine Leader. He is the master of the celebrities, and he is of the progeny of Abd Minaf. The Divine Leader’s knowledge is ever-increasing. His forbearance is perfect. He is cognizant of politics and is worthy of Divine Leadership. Obedience to him is obligatory. He is the executor of God’s commandments and an adviser for God’s servants. He is the protector of God’s religion. God will grant success to the Prophets (s) and the Divine Leaders (s). God will exclusively grant them a part of His stored knowledge and wisdom so that they become the most knowledgeable of people. The Sublime God says, ‘…is then He Who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds not guidance (himself) unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you? How judge ye?’  Also the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘He granteth wisdom to whom He pleaseth; and he to whom wisdom is granted receiveth indeed a benefit overflowing…’ Relating the story of Saul, the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘God hath Chosen him above you, and hath gifted him abundantly with knowledge and bodily prowess: God Granteth His authority to whom He pleaseth. God careth for all, and He knoweth all things.’About the Prophet David (s), the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘… and David slew Goliath; and God gave him power and wisdom and taught him whatever (else) He willed…’Addressing the Prophet Muhammad (s), the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…And great is the Grace of God unto thee.’ About the Divine Leaders from the Prophet’s family, progeny, and offspring, the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Or do they envy mankind for what God hath given them of his bounty? But We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom. Some of them believed, and some of them averted their faces from him: And enough is Hell for a burning fire.’When God selects someone for managing the affairs of His servants, He grants him the will to do so, fills his heart with gushing springs ofwisdom, and bestows upon him full knowledge so that he will have the ability to answer any questions and say nothing but the truth. The Divine Leader is Immaculate and Approved of. God will grant him success. He will be immune from erring, slipping and destruction. God will make him especially this way to serve as His Proof for His servants (people), and His Witness over His creatures. ‘Such is the Bounty of God, which He bestows on whom He will: and God is the Lord of the highest bounty.’  Do they then have such powers or access to such powers to be able to chose the Divine Leader? Or does the one chosen by them have such characteristics to be preferred to others? I swear by God’s House that they have transgressed beyond what is right and have pushed aside God’s Book as if they know nothing. There is healing and guidance in God’s Book and they have put it aside and have followed their own selfish desires. That is why God admonishes them, hates them and destroys them. The Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…and who is more astray than one who follow his own lusts, devoid of guidance from God? For God guides not people given to wrong-doing.’ The Honorable the Exalted God also said, ‘…and (Allah) will render their deeds astray (from their mark).’ The Honorable the Exalted God also said, ‘(Such) as dispute about the Signs of Allah, without any authority that hath reached them, grievous and odious (is such conduct) in the sight of Allah and of the Believers. Thus doth Allah, seal up every heart - of arrogant and obstinate Transgressors.’”",

He (MGB) was sitting alone in the mosque. The Prophet (MGB) was alone so I enjoyed his company in private. He (MGB) told me, ‘O Abuzar! The mosque has certain salutations.’ I asked, ‘What is the mosque’s salutation?’ He (MGB) said, ‘Two units of prayers.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! You are ordering me to say prayers. What are prayers?’ He (MGB) said, ‘It is the best thing. Anyone who wants to say more of it can do so and anyone who wishes to say less of it can do so.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! What is most loved by the Honorable the Exalted God?’ He said, ‘Believing in God and participating in a holy war in His way.’ I asked, ‘What is the best time to pray?’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘In the darkness of the night.’ I asked, ‘What is the best part of praying?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘The lengthening of the Qunut . I asked, ‘What is the best form of giving charity?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘The little bit of charity that a poor man gives an old needy person.’ I asked, ‘What is fasting?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘It is an obligatory act which has a reward near God and is reckoned several-fold by God.’ I asked, ‘Which is the best form of freeing a slave?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘Freeing one who is more expensive and dearer to his family.’ I asked, ‘What is the best form of holy war?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘The one in which one rides his own horse and fights until his blood is shed.’ I asked, ‘Which of the verses of the Holy Quran which God has sent upon you is greater?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘The verse of the Throne (Ayat al-Kursi).’ Then The Prophet (MGB) added, ‘O Abuzar! The seven heavens compared to the Throne are like a ring that has fallen in a broad region of space and the size of the Empyrean Heaven compared to the Throne is like that of a desert in comparison with a ring. I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! How many Prophets were there?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘There have been one-hundred twenty-four thousand Prophets.’ I asked, ‘How many of them were Messengers?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘Three-hundred and thirteen of them that is a large number.’ I asked, ‘Who was the first Prophet?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘Adam.’ I asked, ‘Was he one of the Messengers?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘Yes. God created him with His own Hand and gave to him of His own Spirit.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) added, “O Abuzar! Four of the Prophets spoke in Syriac language namely Adam (MGB); Shees (MGB); Akhnookh - that is Idris (MGB) who is the first to inscribe with a pen and Noah (MGB). Four of the Prophets have been Arabs. They were Hood, Salih, Shoayb and your Prophet Muhammad! The first of the Prophets from the Children of Israel was Moses (MGB) and the last of them was Jesus (MGB). Six-hundred Prophets were from the Children of Israel.’ I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! How many Books did God reveal?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘God revealed one-hundred and four Books. God revealed fifty leafs (Sahifa’s) to Shees, thirty leafs (Sahifa’s) to Idris, twenty leafs (Sahifa’s) to Abraham. God also revealed the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms of David and the Quran.’ I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! What was the leaf sent to Abraham about?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘It all contained proverbs and pieces of advice such as ‘O proud king! I did not appoint you to collect worldly wealth! Rather I appointed you so that you do not let the oppressed ask me for their needs! I shall not turn down the prayers of the oppressed even if they are atheists. A wise man whose mind has not been overwhelmed should divide up his time into three portions. He should supplicate to his Honorable and the Exalted Lord in one portion of his time. He should reckon his deeds in another portion of his time. And in the third portion he should ponder over what the Honorable the Exalted God has created. He should also spent some time in private to enjoy the lawful pleasures. This would assist him in the performance of what he has to do in the other portions of his time. It would calm his heart and prepare him for the rest of his deeds. A wise man should see his life’s condition, recognize his own position and keep his tongue in his mouth. One who considers what he says as a part of his deeds would speak a little and only when it would benefit him. A wise man should always seeks three things. He should either improve his life, provide the savings for the Hereafter, or enjoy the lawful things.’ I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! What was the leaf revealed to Moses about?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘It was all in Hebrew. It contained advice such as, ‘I wonder how one who believes in death can be happy! I wonder how one who believes in the Reckoning and the Resurrection Day can laugh! I wonder how one who has seen this world and its vicissitudes can trust it! I wonder how one who believes in destiny can exert useless efforts! I wonder how one who believes in the Reckoning of deeds doesn’t do anything for his eternity?’ I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! Do we have any of what God revealed to Moses and Abraham in what God has revealed to you?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘O Abuzar! Read: ‘He is successful who growth, And remembereth the name of his Lord, so prayeth. But ye prefer the life of the world although the Hereafter is better and more lasting. Lo! This is in the former scrolls: The Book of Abraham and Moses.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me some advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to fear God as that is the utmost important issue.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to recite the Quran, remember God often as possible, since then you will be remembered in the Heavens and your light shall shine upon the Earth.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to be as quiet as possible, since that would fend off Satan who is the main enemy of your religion.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I admonish you against laughing a lot, since that would cause the heart to perish and the light of your face to fade.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to always consider the situation of the people who are in an inferior position than you are, not those who are in a better position than you are. This way you will be more grateful for what God has bestowed upon you.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to visit your relations of kin even if they may have cut off from you.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to like the poor and associate with them.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to tell the truth even though it may be unpleasant.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you not to fear the blame of those who blame you for the sake of God.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you that what you know about yourself should hinder you from finding faults with others.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) said, ‘It is bad enough for one to have three characteristics: to know faults in others while he himself has them and is unaware of them; to feel ashamed of what others do while he himself has those characteristics to be ashamed of; and unduly hurt his companions.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) added, ‘There is no intellect better than moderation; there is no piety like abstinence from the acts that God has forbidden; and there is no good thing like being good-tempered.’",

They started priding over their lineages and ancestry until they reached Salman (ra). Umar b. al-Khattab said to him, ‘Inform me who you are, and who your father is, and what your origin is’.  So he said: ‘I am Salman, son of a servant of Allah (swt). I had strayed but Allah (swt) had guided me through Muhammad (saw), and I was needy so Allah (swt) enriched through Muhammad (saw), and I was owned [as a slave] so Allah (swt) freed me through Muhammad (saw). This is my lineage, and this is my nobility’.  So Rasulullah (saw) [came out and] said: 'O group of Quraysh, the nobility of a man is his Religion, and his chivalry is his manners, and his origin is his intellect, and Allah (swt) has said: O mankind! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you nations and tribes that you may identify yourselves with one another.' {49:13}. Then the Prophet (saw) said to Salman, ‘There is no virtue over you from any of these ones except by taqwa (i.e., fear of Allah), and if there is piety in you [superior] to them, then you are more virtous [than them].'",

    "englishText": "213. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Abu Hamza, who has narrated the following: Abu Ja’far (asws) having said: ‘The Messenger (saww) asked Jibraeel (as): ‘How were the people of Saleh (as) destroyed?’ So he said: ‘O Muhammad (saww)! Saleh (as) was Sent to his (as) people when he was sixteen years old. So he (saww) was with them until he (as) reached the age of one hundred and twenty years, they did not answer him (as) to the good. And they had for themselves seventy idols which they worshipped apart from Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. So when he (as) saw that among them, he (as) said: ‘O people! I (as) was Sent to you all when I (as) was sixteen years old, and I (as) have now reached one hundred and twenty years, and I (as) present to you all two matters. If you like you can ask me until I (as) ask my (as) God (azwj) so He (azwj) would Answer you with regards to what you have asked me of within a short while. And if you like, I (as) would ask your gods, so if they answer me (as) by that which I (as) have asked them of, I (as) would go away from you all. So I (as) would have silenced you all and you would have silenced me (as)’. They said, ‘You (as) are being fair, O Saleh (as)’. So they prepared for the day that they will be going out for it. So they went out with their idols upon their backs, and prepared their food and drinks. So they ate and drank. When they finished, they called him (as) over. They said, ‘O Saleh (as)! Ask!’. So he (as) said to their elder: ‘What is the name of this one?’ He said, ‘Such and such’. So he (as) said to it: ‘O such and such! Answer me (as)!’ So it did not answer him (as)’. So Saleh (as) said: ‘What is the matter with it that it does not answer?’ They said, ‘Ask another one’. So he (as) asked all of them by their names, but they did not answer him (as) anything. So they turned towards their idols and said to them: ‘What is the matter with you all that you do not answer Saleh (as)?’ They did not answer. So they said, ‘Step away from us and leave us and our idols for a while’. Then they unrolled their rugs, and their furnishings, and their clothes, and wallowed upon the dust, and placed dust upon their heads, and said to their idols, ‘If you do not answer Saleh (as) today, you will be exposed’. Then they called him (as) over, so they said, ‘O Saleh (as)! Call to these (idols)’. So he (as) called upon them. They did not answer him (as). So he (as) said to them: ‘O People! Half the morning has passed and I (as) have not seen your gods to have answered me (as). So ask me (as), and I (as) shall ask my (as) God (azwj), and He (azwj) will Answer you shortly’. Seventy men from their elders were delegated to him (as) from the approved ones from among them, so they said, ‘O Saleh (as)! We ask you, so if your (as) Lord (azwj) were to answer us, we would follow you (as) and answer to you (as), and pledge our allegiances to you (as), all the people of our town altogether’. So Saleh (as) said to them: ‘Ask me (as) whatsoever you like’. So they said, ‘Walk with us towards this mountain’, and the mountain was quite near to them. So Saleh (as) went with them. When he (as) came up to the mountain, they said, ‘O Saleh (as)! Call upon your (as) Lord (azwj) for us, to bring out for us from this mountain this very moment, a blonde, tame, red she-camel with a distance of a mile between the two sides of the mountain’. So Saleh (as) said to them: ‘You have asked me (as) for something which is great for me (as), and is easy for my (as) Lord (azwj) Majestic and Mighty’. Saleh (as) asked Allah (azwj) the High for that. The mountain split asunder with such a split that their intellects took flight when they heard that rumble of it. Then the mountain trembled with a great tremble like a woman trembling during labour. Then only its head came out of the crack in the mountain. When its neck showed, it began to chew its cud. Then the rest of its body came out, and it stood erect upon the ground. So when they all saw that, they said, ‘O Saleh (as), with what ease has your (as) Lord (azwj) Answered you (as). Call upon your (as) Lord (azwj) for us to bring out for us its young’. So he (as) asked Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic for that. She brought it (babies) out and walked around them. So he (as) said to them: ‘O people! Does there remain anything else?’ They said, ‘No. Come with us to our people. We shall inform them of what we have seen and they will believe in you (as)’. So they returned, but before the seventy of them could reach them, sixty four of them had reneged, and they were saying, This is sorcery and a lie’. This was reflected by all of them. So the remaining six were saying that it is the truth, whilst all the others were saying that it is a lie and sorcery. Then they all dispersed upon that, and one of the six then was overcome by doubt. So he was the one who slay it. Ibn Mahboub (the narrator) said, ‘I narrated this Hadeeth to a man from our companions called Saeed Bin Yazeed. He informed me that he had seen the mountain from which (the she-camel) came out, in Syria. He said, ‘I saw its sides where the mountain split up, and the impact of it on its sides and the other side of it, and in between it and this one was a distance of a mile’.",

God will ease the Reckoning of anyone who reachesthe age of fifty. God will grant anyone who reaches the age of sixty opportunity to repent. The companions of the heavens love anyone who reaches the age of seventy. God will order the good deeds to be recorded, and the bad deeds to be eliminated for anyone who reaches the age of eighty.

    "englishText": "22. Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (RA) said: `Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Sa`dabadi said on he authority of Ahmad ibn Abu `Abd Allah al-Barqi, on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn Khalid, on the authority of Ahmad ibn al-Nadr, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Marwan, on the authority of Muhammad ibn al-Sa’ib, on the authority of Abu al-Salih that `Abd Allah ibn `Abbas was asked to interpret the Word of the Mighty and High: And when Musa came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: My Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. He said: You cannot (bear to) see Me but look at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me; but when his Lord manifested to the mountain He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon; then when he recovered, the said: Glory be to Thee, I turn to Thee, and I am the first of the Believers.1 He said: Musa (AS) said: “Glory be to You, I turn to You from asking You to se You, and I am the first of the Believes who bears witness that you cannot be seen.” Muhammad ibn `Ali ibn al-Husayn, the Compiler of this book (RA) says: Verily, Musa (AS) knew that it is not possible to see Allah, the Mighty and High. He surely asked Allah, the Mighty and High, to show Himself to him, so that he may look upon Him. Because his people insisted that he do so. Therefore, Musa (AS) asked the question to His Lord without taking permission from Him. He (AS) said: My Lord! Show me Yourself, so that I may look upon You. God replied: You cannot see Me but look at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me. The meaning of this is that You will never se Me because the mountain never moves in any state. This is like the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: They shall not enter the garden until the camel passes through the eye of the needle.2 The meaning of this is that they will never enter the garden like the camel will never pass through the eye of the needle, but when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain i.e. manifested a sign from His Signs. That sign was a light from the lights which He had created; He cast down His Might on that mountain. He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon from fear of the earthquake which was shaking that mountain with its power. Then, when he recovered, he said: “Glory be to You, I turn to You i.e. I return to my recognition of You, turning from my people and their request to see You.” This repentance was not the result of a sin, since prophets do not commit major or minor sins. The permission before the question was not obligatory upon him; in fact, it was a form of politeness. He always used to d this prior to asking a question. According to one group, he had taken permission before asking that vision was not applicable to Allah, the Mighty and High. Regarding his statement: And I am the first of the Believers, Moses is saying that I am the first of the Believers from the group that were with him. They had asked him to take permission from his Lord to show Himself, so that he may look upon Him. The traditions that have transmitted regarding this subject, and which our elders (RA) have mentioned in their writings, are authentic as far as I am concerned. However, I refrained from transmitting them in this chapter fearing that some ignorant people may read them and interpret them literally, rejecting them, and disbelieving in Allah, the Mighty and High, out of ignorance. The traditions that Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn `Isa has mentioned in his Nawadir and those which Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya has mentioned in his Jami regarding the vision of Allah are authentic. Only the ignorant and the unbelievers can reject them. Their wording is the wording of the Qur`an. These reports negate anthropomorphism [tashbih] and annulment [ta`til] as a means of proving Divine Unity. Our Imams, may the blessings of Allah be upon them, have certainly ordered us not to address people beyond the capacity of their intellect. In these reports, the vision of Allah means the knowledge of Allah. In other words, this world is a place of doubt, uncertainty, and danger. Thus, when the Day of Judgment comes, the Signs of Allah and His Command will unveil for His servants and deliver both reward and punishment. Doubt will be eliminated, and all will attest to the reality and Omnipotence of Allah, the Mighty and High. The confirmation of this is in the Book of Allah, Mighty and High: Certainly you were heedless of it, but now We have removed from you your veil, so your sight today is sharp.1 So, the meaning of what is narrated in the tradition that He, the Mighty and High, will be seen is that He will be known with understanding and surety like His Word, the Mighty and High: Have you not seen your Lord, how He extends the shade?2 And His Word: Did you not see him (Namrud) who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord, and Hid Word: Did you not see those who went forth from their homes, in thousands, fearing death, and His Word: Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the fellows of the elephants? And other examples of this include that vision refers to the vision of the heart, and not the vision of the eyes. As for the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: but when his Lord manifested to the mountain, it means that He, the Mighty and High, made a sign appear as a Sign of the Signs of the hereafter which will make mountains into a mirage, and which will uproot the mountains and scatter them away as dust. The mountain crumbled and turned into dust, because it would not bear that sign. It is said: The light of the throne manifested itself upon the mountain.",

Imam as-Sadiq (MGB) said, “Get to know intelligence and its troops, and ignorance and its troops to be guided.” Soma’at said, “O! May I be your devoted servant. We know nothing except for what you teach us.” Imam as-Sadiq (MGB) said, “God, Exalted is His Praise created the intellect.

Then God ordered it to come forward, but it did not accept. God said, “You rebelled.” Then God cursed it. God then established seventy-five troops for the intellect. When ignorance saw God’s grant to the intellect, it became its enemy and said, “O’ God! You created it and honored it and strengthened it. It is a creature like me.

When ignorance saw God’s grant to the intellect, it became its enemy and said, “O’ God! You created it and honored it and strengthened it. It is a creature like me. I am opposed to it and have no power over it. So please grant me of the troops you grant it.” God said, “Ok I will, but if you disobey I will throw you and your troops out of the domain of My Mercy.” Ignorance said it was pleased, and it was also granted seventy-five troops. The seventy-five troops are as follows: Goodness is the minister for the intellect, and evil is the minister for ignorance; faith for the intellect, and infidelity for ignorance; acceptance for the intellect, and rejection for ignorance; hope for the intellect, and despair for ignorance; justice for the intellect, and oppression for ignorance; contentment for the intellect, and discontent for ignorance; gratitude for the intellect, and ingratitude for ignorance; lack of hope (in God’s Mercy) for the intellect, and greed (in God’s Mercy) for ignorance; reliance on God for intellect, and greed for ignorance; kindness for the intellect, and ruthlessness for ignorance;

calm for the intellect, and rush for ignorance; patience for the intellect, and being feeble-minded for ignorance; silence for the intellect, and being talkative for ignorance; compliance for the intellect, and conceit for ignorance; submission for the intellect, and being oppressive for ignorance; forgiveness for the intellect, and animosity for ignorance; amiability for the intellect, and ruthlessness for ignorance; certitude for the intellect, and doubt for ignorance; perseverance for the intellect, and anxiety for ignorance; pardon for the intellect, and revenge for ignorance; self-sufficiency for the intellect, and poverty for ignorance; pondering for the intellect, and neglect for ignorance; memorizing for the intellect, and forgetting for ignorance; loving for the intellect, and enmity for ignorance; obeying for the intellect, and rebelling for ignorance; contentment for the intellect, and greed for ignorance; justice for the intellect, and injustice for ignorance; friendship for the intellect, and enmity for ignorance; loyalty for the intellect, and treachery for ignorance; humbleness for the intellect, and arrogance for ignorance; right for the intellect, and wrong for ignorance; health for the intellect, and affliction for ignorance; love for the intellect, and hate for ignorance; honesty for the intellect, and telling lies for ignorance; trustworthiness for the intellect, and treason for ignorance; sincerity for the intellect, and corruption for ignorance; bravery for the intellect, and stupidity for ignorance; understanding for the intellect, and ignorance for ignorance; recognition for the intellect, and denial for ignorance; putting up with other people’s minor mistakes for the intellect, and divulging other people’s minor mistakes for ignorance; keeping other’s secrets for the intellect, and divulging other’s secrets for ignorance; hiding for the intellect, and divulging for ignorance; praying for the intellect, and neglecting (prayers) for ignorance; fasting for the intellect, and breaking fast for ignorance; engaging in Jihad (Holy War) for the intellect, and refusal to testify for ignorance; pilgrimage for the intellect, and breaking covenant for ignorance; keeping secrets for the intellect, and slandering for ignorance; being kind to parents for the intellect, and being cursed by parents for ignorance; truth for the intellect, and hypocrisy for ignorance; good for the intellect, and evil for ignorance; covering oneself for the intellect, and playing up a woman’s charms for ignorance; covering up for the intellect, and making up oneself for ignorance; concealment for the intellect and divulging for ignorance; being fair for the intellect, and siding with the wrong for ignorance; making up for the husband for the intellect, and fornication for ignorance; cleanliness for the intellect, and filthiness for ignorance; shyness for the intellect, and taking off clothing for ignorance; assuming a mediators position for the intellect, and aggression for ignorance; comfort for the intellect, and hard work for ignorance; easiness for the intellect, and hardship for ignorance; abundance of blessings for the intellect, and scarcity for ignorance; health for the intellect, and affliction for ignorance; reasonable wealth for the intellect, and hoarding for ignorance; wisdom for the intellect, and selfish desires for ignorance; dignity for the intellect, and humility for ignorance; prosperity for the intellect, and ruin for ignorance; repentance for the intellect, and insistence on sin for ignorance; asking for forgiveness for the intellect, and being too proud for ignorance; protection for the intellect, and neglect for ignorance; performing supplications for the intellect, and abandoning supplications for ignorance; joy for the intellect, and boredom for ignorance; happiness for the intellect, and sorrow for ignorance; intimacy for the intellect, and anger for ignorance; generosity for the intellect, and stinginess for ignorance. All the characteristics which are the troops of the intellect will only be present in the Prophet (MGB) or the Imams (MGB) or a believer who has tested his heart with faith. However, other friends of ours have some of these and can slowly attain the rest and avoid the troops of ignorance. Then they will reach the high ranks of the Prophets and the Imams. This prosperity is only obtained by the recognition of the intellect and its troops, and by avoiding ignorance and its troops. May God assist both you and us in obeying and pleasing Him.”",

The creation of all things from nothing is a manifestation of His Omnipotence. The fleeting nature of all things ins a manifestation of His Permanence. Although no space is devoid of Him, He cannot be subjected to the question “where?” Nothing is similar to Him so He cannot be described through similarity [kayfiyya]. Neither is anything absent from His Knowledge so that He may know it through distinction. He is Dissimilar to the attributes which He has brought about. He cannot be comprehended by what He has created. He is beyond behavioral states due to His Magnificence and Exalted Nature. Limits are forbidden to Him in the brilliant acute mind’s proficiencies. Enquiring minds cannot comprehend His Nature. Intellectual explorers cannot conceive His Shape. Due to His Greatness, He cannot be confined to space. Due to His Majesty, He is beyond measure. Due to His Magnificence, He cannot be divided. Imaginations cannot grasp Him entirely. He cannot be comprehended by minds nor can He be compared. The most eager of intellects cannot hope to comprehend Him through inference. Oceans of Knowledge have dried up attempting to fathom Him. The sharpest minds of the opponents have shriveled attempting to describe His Omnipotence. He is One but not numbers; Everlasting, but not with an extent; and Existing, but without support. He is neither a genus so that the species may be compared to Him, nor a shape so that the shapes may be compared to Him; nor like other things so that descriptions may apply to Him. Intellects have floated away in the waves of His Perception. Imaginations are astonished when contemplating His Eternity. Intellects are prevented from understanding His Omnipotence. The minds have drowned in the depths of the orbit of His Realm which possesses power over the bestowal of blessings, and which forbids with magnificence. He is Sovereign over all thins. He never declines nor is encompassed by an attribute. The obstinate fixed stars surrender to Him through their orbit. The firm causes submit to Him in the utmost heights of their section as a witness from all species over His Lordship. The inability of beings bears witness to His Omnipotence. The coming into being of beings bear witness that He is without a beginning. And the death of beings bears witness that He is Everlasting. Thus, there is no refuge for them from His Reach; there is no fleeing His Encirclement; there is no hiding from His Decree; and there is no avoiding His Omnipotence. The composition of nature is proof. Creation out of nothing is proof that He has no beginning. The creative power is sufficient as an admonition. Thus, there is no limit connected to Him, no likeness of Him, and there is nothing hidden from Him. Exalted is He, the Most High, from the attributes of created things! I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, with faith in His Lordship, and in contrast to those who deny Him. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger, the Inhabitant of the Best Resting Place, the Fruit of the Most Noble Lions and Purified Wombs, the Product of the Most Dignified Lineage and Best Birth place which is inaccessible to others and which has the most honorable foundation. He was chosen by Allah as His trustworthy Friend from the Tree of Prophethood. The tree possesses fine wood, an upright trunk, high branches, blooming twigs, ripened fruits, and a precious interior. In nobility was the tree planted, and in sanctity it grew, branching off, and producing honorable fruits. Hence, the tree was given prestige, and was made lofty by the Prophet Muhammad (SA). Eventually, Allah, the Mighty and High, honored him with the Trusted Spirit [al-Ruh alAmin], the Open Light [al-Nur al-Mubin], and the Evident Book [al-Kitab al-Mustabin]. He made Alboarak [buraq] subservient to Muhammad (SA) and the Angels greeted him. The devils were frightened of him. Through him, Allah destroyed the idols, and the gods that were served other than Him. His practice [Sunnah] is sensible, his conduct [sirah] is just, and his judgment is true. He complied with what his Lord ordered him, and fulfilled his responsibilities. He clearly preached Divine Unity, and made known to creation that there is no god but Allah, the One, the Only, who has not associates. Eventually, he purified the concept of Diving Unity, attributing all Lordship to Him. Through Divine Unity, He made apparent his proof, and with Islam elevated his status. Allah, the Mighty and High, chose for His Prophet (SA) the spirit, the status, and the expedition. May Allah bless him, and his Purified Progeny, as He has blessed all of the Prophets who preceded him!",

He is frightened due to his past, but he doesn’t neglect to seek what God has promised. He is not safe from what the Honorable the Exalted God has frightened us from.You are the cultivators of Earth. The Honorable and the Exalted God has placed you there to see what you do there. Then keep an eye on what God sees you do there.I advise you to stay on this wide road. Lest others will take over your place.Whoever has perfected intellect would do good deeds and guard his religion.‘Be ye foremost (in seeking) Forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden (of Bliss), the width whereof is as the width of heaven and Earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah…’ You would never reach that ‘Garden of Bliss’ unless you are pious.Those who become filthy with sinful deeds would abandon the Honorable the Exalted God’s remembrance.God would appoint a satan to be constantly with whomever doesn’t obey those whom the Honorable the Exalted God has ordered us to obey.Your opponents are more steadfast in their wickedness. They are better in spending money on their desires. Indeed you pay attention to this world on which you rely. You have become used to tolerating cruelty. You are stingy regarding this world’s goods and have neglected what would be better for your honor, comfort and power to overcome those who oppress you. You are neither ashamed of God regarding what He has ordered you to do, nor would you think about what would be best for you.You are not awakened, although you are oppressed every day. Your feebleness doesn’t end.Don’t you see that each day your towns and religion suffer more and more, while you are ignorant and entertained with this world. The Honorable the Exalted God tells you, ‘And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and ye have no protectors other than God, nor shall ye be helped.’You should name your children. In case you do not know their gender (before birth), you can give them a name that is suitable for either boys or girls. Even if it gets aborted, it would question the father on the Resurrection Day for not having named it. God’s Prophet (MGB) had named Fatimah’s (MGB) child Mohsen before he was born.You should not drink water while standing up, since that would cause a pain for which there is no cure unless the Honorable the Exalted God restores health.Whenever you mount a quadruped remember the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs, and when so seated, ye may celebrate the (kind) favor of your Lord, and say, \"Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our (use), for we could never have accomplished this (by ourselves). And to our Lord, surely, must we turn back!”’Whenever you go on a trip you should say: “O Allah, You are the companion in journeys, the helper in transport, and the guard of the wife, property, and sons. ”When you settle down in a house you should say, “O Allah, grant me a blessed landing. You are the One who provides the safest landing.”When you go shopping you should say, “I declare there is no god but Allah uniquely without any associate, and declare that Mohammed is His servant and messenger. O Allah, I seek Your safety from losing deals and perjury, and seek Your safety from stagnancy.”Anyone who awaits for the time of the next prayer is considered to be amongst the visitors of the Honorable the Exalted God. He has a right incumbent upon the Sublime God to honor His visitors and grant them whatever they ask for.Whoever goes on the Hajj pilgrimage or the Umra Hajj is God’s guest. It is hoped that God would forgive him.The Sublime God will imprison in oozy grounds in Hell whoever gives a child an alcoholic drink, until he apologizes for what he has done.Giving charity is a strong shield from the Fire for a believer, and for a nonbeliever is a device to save his money. It is a protection of property for an atheist. Soon it will be returned to him. It would fend off calamities. However, there will be no heavenly reward for it for an atheist.The residents of Hell shall fall down into the Fire with their tongues first.The residents of Light will be bestowed light through their tongues. Therefore watch your tongues and keep them busy remembering the Honorable the Exalted God.The most wicked deed is what would lead one to going astray. The best deeds are acts of charity.Beware not to make any sculptures, since you would be questioned about them on the Resurrection Day.",

    "author": "Shaykh Muḥammad b. Yaʿqūb al-Kulaynī",
    "translator": "Muhammad Sarwar",
    "englishText": "29. Narrated to me Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Isa, and Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father altogether from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Abdullah Bin Ghalib Al-Asady from his father, from Saeed Bin Al-Musayyab who said: ‘Ali Bin Al-Husayn (asws) used to advise the people and to make them to be ascetic in this world and incline them towards the deeds for the Hereafter by this speech in every Friday in the Masjid of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) which was preserved and written down. He (asws) would say: ‘O you people! Fear Allah (azwj) and know that you will be returning to Him (azwj). So each soul would find what it had done in this world from the good in recorded form, and what it had done from the evil even though there would have been between it and itself a long time. And Allah (azwj) Himself (azwj) has Cautioned you, and woe be unto you O oblivious son of Adam (as) for He (azwj) is not Oblivious of you. O son of Adam (as), your death is the quickest thing coming towards you seeking you in an aggressive manner. It would be around you when your time elapses and the Angel would capture your soul and take you to your grave alone. It would then return your soul back to you in it, and two Angels would storm into it, Naakir and Nakeer to question you and test you severely. And indeed! the first thing what they will ask you would be about your Lord (azwj) which you had worshipped, and about your Prophet (saww) who (saww) was sent to you, and about your Religion which you had made it to be, and about your Book which you recited, and about your Imam (asws) whom you had befriended. Then about your life what you had spent it on, and your wealth from where you had acquired it and in what you had spent it on. So take caution and look at yourself, and prepare the answers before the examination, and the questioning, and the test. So if you are a Believer having understood your Religion, followed the truthful ones (asws), befriended the friends of Allah (azwj), Allah (azwj) will Provide your argument for you, and make your tongue to speak correctly and give good answers, and you will receive the news of the happiness and the Paradise from Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. And the Angels will welcome you with joyful spirits and aromatic fragrance. If you do not become like that, your tongue will waver, and your argument will fail, and you will be unable to answer, and you will receive news of the Fire, and the Angels of Punishment will drag you into the Hell and its intense heat. And know, O son of Adam (as) that what is coming behind you on the Day of Judgement is greater and more shocking and painful for the heart. That is the Day in which all people would be Gathered and that is the Day of Witnessing. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic will Gather in it the former ones and the later ones. That is the Day in which the Trumpet would be Blown and the graves would be scattered. And that is the Day of tremors and the hearts would come up to the throat and the stumbling would not be reduced, and no ransom would be taken from anyone, and no excuses would be acceptable from anyone, and no repentance would be Accepted from anyone. There is nothing except for the Recompense for the good deeds and the Recompense for the evil deeds. So the one who was from the Believers having done a good deed in this world the weight of an atom would find it, and the one was from the Believers having done an evil deed in this world the weight of an atom would find it too. So be cautious, O you people from the sins and the disobedience to what Allah (azwj) has Forbidden you from and Cautioned you in His (azwj) Truthful Book, and the Speaking Proofs (asws). And do not feel secure from the Abhorrence of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Cautions and His (azwj) Threats from what the accursed Satan (la) calls you to himself (la) from the desires of short duration and the pleasures in this world, for Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “[7:201] Surely those who guard (against evil), when a visitation from the Shaitan afflicts them they become mindful, then lo! they see”. You must get your hearts to feel the fear of Allah (azwj) and remember what He (azwj) has Promised you regarding your returning to Him (azwj) from the good Rewards from Him (azwj), just as you fear the harsh Punishment, for the one who fears something would be cautious of it, and the one who is cautious of something would avoid it. And do not become of the oblivious ones, the ones inclined towards the flowers of the world of those who devise evil, for Allah (azwj) Said in His (azwj) Decisive Book: “[16:45] Do they then who plan evil (deeds) feel secure (of this) that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that punishment may not overtake them from whence they do not perceive? [16:46] Or that He may not seize them in the course of their journeys, then shall they not escape; [16:47] Or that He may not seize them by causing them to suffer gradual loss” So be cautious of what Allah (azwj) has Cautioned you with what He (azwj) has Done with the unjust ones in His (azwj) Book, and do not feel secure from what has been Promised for the unjust people in the Book. By Allah (azwj), Allah (azwj) has Advised you all in His (azwj) Book by way of other people. So, happy is the one who takes a lesson from the advice given to others. Allah (azwj) has Made you hear in His (azwj) Book what He (azwj) has Done with the unjust people of the town before you where He (azwj) said: “[21:11] And how many a town which was iniquitous did We demolish”, but rather what is Meant by the ‘town’ is its inhabitants, where He (azwj) Said: “[21:11] and We raised up after it another people!”. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “[21:12] Yet, when they felt Our Punishment (coming), behold, they (tried to) flee from it. [21:13] Flee not, but return to the good things of this life which were given you, and to your homes in order that ye may be called to account.” So when the Punishment Came upon them, they said “[21:14] They said: O woe to us! surely we were unjust [21:15] And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as a field that is mown, as ashes silent and quenched”. By Allah (azwj), let this be an Advice for you and a Warning that you should heed and fear. Then refer to the Words from Allah (azwj) in His (azwj) Book against the people of disobedience and the sins. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “[21:46] And if a blast of the chastisement of your Lord were to touch them, they will certainly say: O woe to us! surely we were unjust”. O you people! If you were to say that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Meant by this the people of the ‘Mushriqeen’ (Polytheism), so how can that be and He (azwj) Says: “[21:47] And We will set up a just balance on the day of resurrection, so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and though there be the weight of a grain of mustard seed, (yet) will We bring it, and sufficient are We to take account.” Know, O servants of Allah (azwj), that the people of the Polytheism will not have a Balance set up for them nor will their Register (of deeds) be published and they will be herded to Hell in groups, but rather the Balance and the publishing of the Register (of deeds) will be for the people of Al-Islam. So fear Allah (azwj), O servants of Allah (azwj) and know that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic does not Love the blossoms of the world and its temporal matters for anyone of His (azwj) friends and does not Encourage them with regards to it and regarding its temporary blossoms and apparent delights. But rather, He (azwj) Created the world and Created its people so that they may be Tested therein as to which one of them is good in deeds for his Hereafter. And by Allah (azwj), He (azwj) has Struck examples for you with regards to it and Presented Signs for the people of intellect, and there is no Strength except by Allah (azwj). So abstain yourselves from what Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Told you to abstain from regarding the temporary life of the world, for Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said, and His (azwj) Words are the Truth: “[10:24] The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies: by its mingling arises the produce of the earth- which provides food for men and animals: (It grows) till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out (in beauty): the people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it: There reaches it Our command by night or by day, and We make it like a harvest clean-mown, as if it had not flourished only the day before! thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who reflect.” Servants of Allah (azwj)! become of the people who reflect and do not incline towards the world, for Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said to Muhammad (saww): “[11:113] And do not incline to those who are unjust, lest the fire touch you,”, and do not incline towards the blossoms of the world and what is in it, like those who have taken it to be a house of permanent settlement for it is a lowly house, a shabby home, and a place of deeds. So make provisions in it of the good deeds before its days disperse and before the Call from Allah (azwj) for its destruction, for the One (azwj) Who Destroys it is the One (azwj) Who Built it in the first place and initiated it and He (azwj) is the Guardian of its inheritance. So I hereby ask Allah (azwj) for the Support for us (asws) and for you all for the provisions of the piety and the restraint and may Allah (azwj) Make us (asws) and you to be of the ascetics with regards to the blossoms of the life of the world and of those who are hopeful for the Rewards of the Hereafter, for we are with Him (azwj) and for Him (azwj). And Greetings of peace be upon Muhammad (saww) the Prophet and his (saww) Progeny (asws) and peace, and peace be upon you all and the Mercy of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Blessings’.",

He said: Abu Ubaidullah Muhammad ibn Imran al-Marzbani reported to me from Ahmad ibn Sulaiman al-Tusi, from al-Zubair ibn Bakkar, from Abdullah ibn Wahab, from al-Suddi, from Abd Khair, from Qubaisah ibn Jabir al-Asadi, who said: A man visited Amirul Mu’mineen ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, and questioned him about Faith.

He made it a proof for those who spoke for it, a light for those who sought to be illuminated by it, a strong witness against those who disputed it, and a victory for those who argued for it. He made it a (good) knowledge for those who contained it and a (worthy) tradition for those who narrated about it. He made it the (best) basis of judgement for those who adjudged by it, (full of) wisdom for those who experienced, source of intellect for those who pondered, an understanding for those who grasped, certitude for those who recognized, an insight for those who are intent, a sign for those who perceive, an admonition for those who draw lesson, salvation for those who confirmed its truth. He made it a way of divine love for those who reformed (themselves) and a path of proximity (to Allah) for those who expected it, and a place of trust for those who entrusted. He made it a repose for those who handed over the charge of their affairs (to Allah) and a shield for those who endure. Truth is its way, guidance its (prime) quality, kindness its distinctive feature. It is the most clear path, the towering beacon, the most brilliant light. (Using an equestrian metaphor, he said), It has the highest flag, facile racetrack, an encompassing arena, a contestant for winning the race, and noble horsemen. Confirming the truth is its track, good deeds are its beacons, learning Islam is its light, death is its flag (at the destination), the world is its racetrack, and the Day of Reckoning is its arena; and attaining Paradise its victory, and hellfire its resentment. Taqwa is its implement and people of good deeds are its horsemen. From Faith, one seeks guidance to good and righteous deeds, and with the righteous deeds, learning of Islam is (truly) maintained. And with the knowledge of Islam, death is dreaded, and with death comes the end of (life in) the world. And it is through this world (life) that one passes over to Resurrection, and it will be with the Resurrection, that Paradise will be brought close to the God-fearing, and justify hell for those who have gone astray. So Faith is supported by four pillars: Endurance, Certitude, Justice and struggle (in the way of Allah). And endurance among them is subdivided into four branches: motivation, fear, renunciation and anticipation. Know you that one who is motivated by the yearning for Paradise keeps away from base desires, and one who fears hell abandons the forbidden acts, and one who renounces (by detachment from the) world, finds it easy to face the worldly ordeals, and who anticipates death, hastens to do charitable deeds. And certitude has four branches: intelligent discernment, wise interpretation, drawing lesson from the events, and (studying) the example of the previous generations. So, he who discerns with intelligence will be able to unravel (the secrets of) wisdom, and he who perceives wisdom understands the tradition (handed down) and for he who understands the tradition, it will be as if he belongs to the past generation. And justice has four branches: subtle insight, abundant knowledge, being sensibly judicious and drilled in patience. So he who has an insight, deserves the beauty of knowledge, and he who has knowledge, knows the ways of dispensing justice, and he who is judicious, never goes astray. And he who is patient and enduring never neglects his affairs and thus lives among the people highly appreciated. And struggle (in the way of Allah) has four branches: enjoining good, forbidding evil, being truthful in all situations, and detestation of the impious. So he who enjoins good, lends strength to the believer, and he who forbids evil earns the scorn of the unbelievers; and he who is truthful in all situations (fearlessly) judges against himself, and he who abhors the impious displays anger for the sake of Allah; and he who displays anger for His sake is a true believer.

    "englishText": "3. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al-Taliqani (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Sa`id ibn Yahya al-Buzuri said: Ibrahim ibn al-Haytham al-Baladi said: My father said on the authority of alMu`afi ibn `Imran, on the authority of Isra`il, on the authority of al-Miqdad ibn Shurayh ibn Hani’, on the authority of his father that On the Day of Battle of Jamal, a Bedouin stood before the Commander of the Faithful (AS), and asked, “O Commander of the Faithful! Do you say that Allah is One?” He says: the people attacked him saying that “O Bedouin! Do you not see the state of mind of the Commander of the Faithful?” So the Commander of the Faithful (AS) said: “Leave him alone. Verily, what this Bedouin seeks to know is what we are seeking to establish by fighting these people.” He (the Commander of the Faithful) then said: O Bedouin! The statement that `Allah is One’ is of four types: Two types cannot be applied to Allah, the Mighty and High; while the two other types can be applied to Him. As for the two types of statements that cannot be applied to Him, the first is the claim that Allah is One in a numerical sense. Such a statement cannot be applied to Allah, because as the One, He has no second, and He is not subject to mathematic calculation. Do you not see that he who claims that Allah is the third of the three has disbelieved (in Him)? The second statement which cannot be applied to Allah is the claim that He is One with humankind. Since He derives the species from the genus, He cannot be described through anthropomorphism [tashbih]. Our Lord is Higher and more Exalted than this. As for the two types of statements that can be applied to Allah, the first would be to say that He is the One who resembles none. The second statement which can apply to Allah is the statement that He, the Mighty and High, is Alone, in the sense that He is Indivisible in Existence [wujud], Intellect [`aql], and Thought [wahm]. That is another dignified description of our Lord, he Mighty and High. The Compiler of this book says: I have heard the following from a person I trust due to the fact that he is religious and due to his mastery of both Classical and colloquial Arabic: Verily, the words one, two three, and so forth, were developed in order to express quantity, and not to express quality. They have no meaning outside of counting, and determining units of measure in the tens, hundreds, and thousands. Likewise, when someone intends to inform another person about the exact quantity of a thing, he names it by its specific name, and applies the number `one’ to it, describing its quantity, as opposed to its attributes. This is why one says: one pound [dirham], and one intends only a pound, while it could be a pound in weight or a pound in number. So, if the persons want to convey the meaning of weight, he would say: one pound in weight, but if he wants to convey the meaning of number, he says; one pound in number. On the basis, if a person says “one man,” the man can be one in the sense that he is one human being, as opposed to two. Or, he could be unique in merits, unique in knowledge, unique in generosity or unique in bravery. Thus, if a person intends to convey the sense of quantity, he says: “one man;” in the sense that he is one man as opposed to two men. However, if he intends to describe someone’s excellence, he says: he is one of a kind (there is no `one’ like him). This indicates that nobody compares to him. If he wanted to stress the knowledge of a person, he would say: he is unique in knowledge. Hence, since the word `one’ can indicate excellence, as well as quantity, it means that whoever called him `one’ under these circumstances meant that there he had no second. In other words, there was no scholar like him, and no person like him in quality. When this is not the case, then it is correct to say that `one’ merely indicates quantity. Otherwise, there, would be no sense in saying `one of a kind’ or limiting the meaning of knowledge or bravery. It has been established that when a person uses the word “one” on its own, it indicates quantity. However, depending on the context, it can also mean “one” or “unique” in knowledge, excellence, and generosity. As we have already explained, `one’ pound [dirham] can be one pound in weight, one pound in number or count. It can also be two pounds in weight, and one pound in number or count. Sometimes it is six dawaniq,1 and sixty fulus,2 and has many fractions. Likewise, a slave can be one salve, and not two slaves; a person can be one person, and not two people, when in reality they are composed of many parts which are composed of many more parts. In this sense, the slave cannot be `one.’ Verily, the slave is not one or unique [wahid], because every slave has someone who is similar to him. It makes perfect sense for a slave to have someone who is the same as him in attributes and qualities. Hence it is necessary that Allah, the Mighty and High, be Unique in His Attributes and Most Beautiful Names. This is what makes Him truly One God, who has no likeness; the One, who has no associates; and there is no god but He. Therefore, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is the One, the Eternal3 [qadim], and there is no god but He. He is Unique, none is eternal but He, the Existing, who does not change, and is not subject to change. He is the One beyond compare. Nothing is similar to Him. Nothing resembles Him. And nothing is like Him. Thus, He is an Indivisible Being in both Essence and Imagination, a Think unlike other Things, and the One and Only True God. There is no god but Him! In conclusion, in Islamic Law, the titles the One [Wahid], and the Unique [Ahad], apply specifically to Him, and are excluded from others. None but Allah, the Mighty and High, can bear these titles. And, as we have already explained, Allah is a name which can only applied to Him. In addition to these examples, a thing can sometimes be counted with something which is similar to it. It is said: this is a man, these are two men, and these are three men; this is a slave, this is black, these are two slaves, these two are black. Therefore, it is not permissible to say: these are two gods as there is no god but the One God. Thus, Allah cannot be counted in this manner, nor does He enter numbers in this form in any way. Sometimes a thing is counted with something different to it. Hence, it is said: this is the color white, these are white and black colors; this is a recent one [muhdath], these are two recent ones; these are not two ones, and these are not two creatures; One of them is Eternal, and the other is recent; one of them is the Lord, and the other is the servant. So, on this basis, it is acceptable to apply numbers to Him as Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said: Nowhere is there a secret counsel between three persons but He is the Fourth of them, not (between) five but He is the Sixth of them, nor less than that nor more but He is with them wheresoever they are.1 Similarly, the statement `Verily’, he is `one man’ does not merely stress his excellence. Likewise, our statement, `so and so in number two to so and so,’ does not simply indicate that he exist. It only does so when it is specified that `he is second to him in excellence, in perfection, or in knowledge.’ As for the Unity of Allah, Exalted is His Remembrance, it refers to the Unity between His Exalted Attribute, and His Most Beautiful Names. He is One, without associates, and without similarity. He who affirms this about the Mighty and High on the basis of His Exalted Attribute and Most Beautiful Names with conviction is a true monotheist. Hence, the one who fails to recognize Allah, the Mighty and High, through his Exalted Attributes, and Most Beautiful Names, does not affirm His Oneness, and is not a true monotheist. Sometimes the ignorant people say: Verily, a monotheist is one who professes the Oneness of Allah even if He does profess the Unity of His Attributes. The ignorant people are told: You have rejected Divine Unity. Whoever claims that His Lord is One God, and One Being, and then applies His Attributes to other than Him, is an idolater, an anthropomorphist, and a nonMuslim according to the consensus of every school of thought in the Ummah. Such is the case, even if he claims that His Lord id One God, One Thing and One Being. Accepting Divine Unity, while failing to accept the Divine Attributes, is like saying Allah is separate from His Attributes whereas Divine Unity is the Unity between Allah and His Attributes. I is impossible for another god to exist. Allah is One God without partners, and without similarity. If He was not United with His Attributes, then he would have an associate or something similar to Him. Likewise, if a servant did not embody him own attributes, another servant would have to exist. As a result, he would not be one servant, but two servants. Hence, anyone who professes that Allah is One with His Attributes is a true monotheist, and a Believer in Divine Unity. Allah, the Mighty and High, unites every attribute which is applicable exclusively to Him. These attributes include the Existent since it cannot be conceive that He can dissolve into something or that something can dissolve into Him. Nor is it conceivable that His Existence can come to an end, that He can be destroyed, or that He can suffer any type of decline. He is the First of the First, the Last of the Last, and the Omnipotent. He is not subject to weakness or inability. He is the Most Powerful of the Powerful, and the Subduer [qahir] of all Subduers. He is Omniscient: nothing is hidden from Him, and nothing escapes Him. He is the Most Learned of the Learned. Ignorance, mistakes, errors, doubts, and forgetfulness cannot be attributed to Him. He is the Ever-Living. He is not subject to sleep or death. Nothing benefits Him nor can anything harm Him. He is the One who Remains, the Most Complete of the Complete, and the Doer who is never occupied. Nothing incapacitates Him nor does He miss anything. He is the Lord of the First and Last, the Best of Creators, and the Foremost of those who take account. He is the Wealthy One [ghani], devoid of nothing. He is the Self-Sufficient [mustaghni], devoid of need. He is the Just, devoid of criticism and defects. He is the Wise One, devoid of foolishness. He is the Most Merciful, whose Mercy cannot be increased kindness.2 He is the Forbearing [halim], devoid of emotion and haste. He is the Most Just of the Just, the Best of Judges, and the Foremost of those who take Account. This is because the first of the First cannot be but One. He is the Omnipotent, the Most Learned, the Best of Judges, the Best of Creators, and all such descriptions are correct. Favor is from Allah, as is protection and guidance.",

المؤمنين أتقول: إن الله واحد؟ قال: فحمل الناس عليه، قالوا: يا أعرابي أما ترى ما فيه أمير المؤمنين من تقسم القلب، فقال أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام: دعوه، فإن الذي يريده الأعرابي هو الذي نريده من القوم، ثم قال: يا أعرابي إن القول في أن الله واحد على أربعة أقسام: فوجهان منها لا يجوزان على الله عز وجل، و وجهان يثبتان فيه، فأما اللذان لا يجوزان عليه، فقول القائل: واحد يقصد به باب الأعداد، فهذا ما لا يجوز، لأن ما لا ثاني له لا يدخل في باب الأعداد، أما ترى أنه كفر من قال: ثالث ثلاثة. وقول القائل: هو واحد من الناس، يريد به النوع من الجنس، فبهذا ما لا يجوز عليه لأنه تشبيه، وجل ربنا عن ذلك و تعالى . وأما الوجهان اللذان يثبتان فيه فقول القائل: هو واحد ليس له في الأشياء شبه، كذلك ربنا، وقول القائل: إنه عز وجل أحدي المعنى، يعني به أنه لا ينقسم في وجود ولا عقل ولا وهم  كذلك ربنا عز وجل. قال مصنف هذا الكتاب: سمعت من أثق بدينه ومعرفته باللغة والكلام يقول: إن قول القائل: واحدا واثنين وثلاثة إلى آخره إنما وضع في أصل اللغة للإبانة عن كمية ما يقال عليه، لا لأن له مسمى يتسمى به بعينه، أو لأن له معنى سوى ما يتعلمه الانسان بمعرفة الحساب ويدور عليه عقد الأصابع عند ضبط الآحاد و العشرات والمئات الألوف، وكذلك متى أراد مريد أن يخبر غيره عن كمية شئ بعينه سماه باسمه الأخص ثم قرن لفظ الواحد به وعلقه عليه يدل به على كميته لا على ما عدا ذلك من أوصافه، ومن أجله يقول القائل: درهم واحد، وإنما يعني به أنه درهم فقط، وقد يكون الدرهم درهما بالوزن، ودرهما بالضرب، فإذا أراد المخبر أن يخبر عن وزنه قال: درهم واحد بالوزن، وإذا أراد أن يخبر عن عدده وضربه قال: درهم واحد بالعدد ودرهم واحد بالضرب، وعلى هذا الأصل يقول القائل: هو رجل واحد، وقد يكون الرجل واحدا بمعنى أنه إنسان وليس بإنسانين، ورجل وليس برجلين، وشخص وليس بشخصين، ويكون واحد في الفضل واحدا في العلم واحدا في السخاء واحدا في الشجاعة، فإذا أراد القائل أن يخبر عن كميته قال: هو رجل واحد، فدل ذلك من قوله على أنه رجل وليس هو برجلين، وإذا أراد أن يخبر عن فضله قال: هذا واحد عصره، فدل ذلك على أنه لا ثاني له في الفضل، وإذا أراد أن يدل على علمه قال: إنه واحد في علمه، فلو دل قوله: واحد بمجرده على الفضل والعلم كما دل بمجرده على الكمية لكان كل من أطلق عليه لفظ واحد أراد فاضلا لا ثاني له في فضله وعالما لا ثاني له في علمه وجوادا لا ثاني له في جوده، فلما لم يكن كذلك صح أنه بمجرده لا يدل إلا على كمية الشئ دون غيره وإلا لم يكن لما أضيف إليه من قول القائل: واحد عصره ودهره معنى، ولا كان لتقييده بالعلم والشجاعة معنى، لأنه كان يدل بغير تلك الزيادة وبغير ذلك التقييد على غاية الفضل وغاية العلم والشجاعة، فلما احتيج معه إلى زيادة لفظ و احتيج إلى التقييد بشئ صح ما قلناه، فقد تقرر أن لفظة القائل: واحد إذا قيل على الشئ دل بمجرده على كميته في اسمه الأخص، ويدل بما يقترن به على فضل المقول عليه وعلى كماله وعلى توحده بفضله وعلمه وجوده، وتبين أن الدرهم الواحد قد يكون درهما واحدا بالوزن، ودرهما واحدا بالعدد ودرهما وحدا بالضرب، وقد يكون بالوزن درهمين وبالضرب درهما واحدا، وقد يكون بالدوانيق ستة دوانيق وبالفلوس ستين فلسا ويكون بالأجزاء كثيرا، وكذلك يكون العبد عبدا واحدا ولا يكون عبدين بوجه، ويكون شخصا واحدا ولا يكون شخصين بوجه، ويكون أجزاء كثيرة وأبعاضا كثيرة، وكل بعض من أبعاضه يكون جواهر كثيرة متحدة اتحد بعضها ببعض، وتركب بعضها مع بعض، ولا يكون العبد واحدا وإن كان كل واحد منا في نفسه إنما هو عبد واحد، وإنما لم يكن العبد واحدا لأنه ما من عبد إلا وله مثل في الوجود أو في المقدور، وإنما صح أن يكون للعبد مثل لأنه لم يتوحد بأوصافه التي من أجلها صار عبدا مملوكا، ووجب لذلك أن يكون الله عز وجل متوحدا بأوصافه العلى وأسمائه الحسنى، ليكون إلها واحدا ولا يكون له مثل، ويكون واحدا لا شريك له ولا إله غيره، فالله تبارك وتعالى واحد لا إله إلا هو، وقديم واحد لا قديم إلا هو، وموجود واحد ليس بحال ولا محل ولا موجود كذلك إلا هو، وشئ واحد لا يجانسه شئ، ولا يشاكله شئ، ولا يشبهه شئ، ولا شئ كذلك إلا هو، فهو كذلك موجود غير منقسم في الوجود ولا في الوهم، وشئ لا يشبهه شئ بوجه، وإله لا إله غيره بوجه، وصار قولنا: يا واحد يا أحد في الشريعة اسما خاصا له دون غيره لا يسمى به إلا هو عز وجل، كما أن قولنا: الله اسم لا يسمى به غيره. وفصل آخر في ذلك وهو أن الشئ قد يعد مع ما جانسه وشاكله وماثله، يقال: هذا رجل، وهذان رجلان، وثلاثة رجال، وهذا عبد، وهذا سواد، وهذان عبدان، وهذان سوادان، ولا يجوز على هذا الأصل أن يقال: هذان إلهان إذ لا إله إلا إله واحد، فالله لا يعد على هذا الوجه، ولا يدخل في العدد من هذا الوجه بوجه، وقد يعد الشئ مع ما لا يجانسه ولا يشاكله، يقال: هذا بياض، وهذان بياض وسواد، وهذا محدث، وهذان محدثان، وهذان ليسا بمحدثين ولا بمخلوقين، بل أحدهما قديم والآخر محدث وأحدهما رب والآخر مربوب، فعلى هذا الوجه يصح دخوله في العدد، وعلى هذا النحو قال الله تبارك وتعالى: ﴿ما يكون من نجوى ثلاثة إلا هو رابعهم ولا خمسة إلا هو سادسهم ولا أدنى من ذلك ولا أكثر إلا هو معهم أينما كانوا - الآية﴾  وكما أن قولنا: إنما هو رجل واحد لا يدل على فضله بمجرده فكذلك قولنا: فلان ثاني فلان. لا يدل بمجرده إلا على كونه، وإنما يدل على فضله متى قيل: إنه ثانيه في الفضل أو في الكمال أو العلم. فأما توحيد الله تعالى ذكره فهو توحيده بصفاته العلى، وأسمائه الحسنى كان كذلك إلها واحدا لا شريك له ولا شبيه، والموحد هو من أقر به على ما هو عليه عز وجل من أوصافه العلى، وأسمائه الحسنى على بصيرة منه ومعرفة وإيقان و إخلاص، وإذا كان ذلك كذلك فمن لم يعرف الله عز وجل متوحدا بأوصافه العلى، وأسمائه الحسنى ولم يقر بتوحيده بأوصافه العلى، فهو غير موحد، وربما قال جاهل من الناس: إن من وحد الله وأقر أنه واحد فهو موحد وإن لم يصفه بصفاته التي توحد بها لأن من وحد الشئ فهو موحد في أصل اللغة، فيقال له: أنكرنا ذلك لأن من زعم أن ربه إله واحد وشئ واحد، ثم أثبت معه موصوفا آخر بصفاته التي توحد بها فهو عند جميع الأمة وسائر أهل الملل ثنوي غير موحد ومشرك مشبه غير مسلم، و إن زعم أن ربه إله واحد وشئ واحد وموجود واحد، وإذا كان كذلك وجب أن يكون الله تبارك وتعالى متوحدا بصفاته التي تفرد بالإلهية من أجلها وتوحد بالوحدانية لتوحده بها ليستحيل أن يكون إله آخر، ويكون الله واحدا والإله واحدا لا شريك له ولا شبيه لأنه إن لم يتوحد بها كان له شريك وشبيه كما أن العبد لما لم يتوحد بأوصافه التي من أجلها كان عبدا كان له شبيه، ولم يكن العبد واحدا وإن كان كل واحد منا عبدا واحدا، وإذا كان كذلك فمن عرفه متوحدا بصفاته وأقر بما عرفه واعتقد ذلك كان موحدا وبتوحيد ربه عارفا. والأوصاف التي توحد الله عز وجل بها وتوحد بربوبيته لتفرده بها هي الأوصاف التي يقتضي كل واحد منها أن لا يكون الموصوف به إلا واحدا لا يشاركه فيه غيره ولا يوصف به إلا هو، وتلك الأوصاف هي كوصفنا له بأنه موجود واحد لا يصح أن يكون حالا في شئ، ولا يجوز أن يحله شئ، ولا يجوز عليه العدم والفناء والزوال، مستحق للوصف بذلك بأنه أول الأولين، وآخر الآخرين، قادر يفعل ما يشاء ولا يجوز عليه ضعف ولا عجز، مستحق للوصف بذلك بأنه أقدر القادرين وأقهر القاهرين، عالم لا يخفى عليه شئ، ولا يعزب عنه شئ، ولا يجوز عليه جهل ولا سهو ولا شك ولا نسيان، مستحق للوصف بذلك بأنه أعلم العالمين، حي لا يجوز عليه موت ولا نوم، ولا ترجع إليه منفعة ولا تناله مضرة، مستحق للوصف بذلك بأنه أبقى الباقين وأكمل الكاملين، فاعل لا يشغله شئ عن شئ ولا يعجزه شئ ولا يفوته شئ، مستحق للوصف بذلك بأنه إله الأولين والآخرين وأحسن الخالقين وأسرع الحاسبين، غني لا يكون له قلة، مستغن لا يكون له حاجة، عدل لا يلحقه مذمة ولا يرجع إليه منقصة، حكيم لا تقع منه سفاهة، رحيم لا يكون له رقة فيكون في رحمته سعة، حليم لا يلحقه موجدة، ولا يقع منه عجلة، مستحق للوصف بذلك بأنه أعدل العادلين وأحكم الحاكمين وأسرع الحاسبين، وذلك لأن أول الأولين لا يكون إلا واحدا وكذلك أقدر القادرين وأعلم العالمين وأحكم الحاكمين وأحسن الخالقين، وكلما جاء على هذا الوزن، فصح بذلك ما قلناه، وبالله التوفيق ومنه العصمة والتسديد.  باب تفسير قل هو الله أحد إلى آخرها ",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "3. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al-Taliqani (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Sa`id ibn Yahya al-Buzuri said: Ibrahim ibn al-Haytham al-Baladi said: My father said on the authority of alMu`afi ibn `Imran, on the authority of Isra`il, on the authority of al-Miqdad ibn Shurayh ibn Hani’, on the authority of his father that ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "On the Day of Battle of Jamal, a Bedouin stood before the Commander of the Faithful (AS), and asked, “O Commander of the Faithful! Do you say that Allah is One?” He says: the people attacked him saying that “O Bedouin! Do you not see the state of mind of the Commander of the Faithful?” So the Commander of the Faithful (AS) said: “Leave him alone. Verily, what this Bedouin seeks to know is what we are seeking to establish by fighting these people.” He (the Commander of the Faithful) then said: O Bedouin! The statement that `Allah is One’ is of four types: Two types cannot be applied to Allah, the Mighty and High; while the two other types can be applied to Him. As for the two types of statements that cannot be applied to Him, the first is the claim that Allah is One in a numerical sense. Such a statement cannot be applied to Allah, because as the One, He has no second, and He is not subject to mathematic calculation. Do you not see that he who claims that Allah is the third of the three has disbelieved (in Him)? The second statement which cannot be applied to Allah is the claim that He is One with humankind. Since He derives the species from the genus, He cannot be described through anthropomorphism [tashbih]. Our Lord is Higher and more Exalted than this. As for the two types of statements that can be applied to Allah, the first would be to say that He is the One who resembles none. The second statement which can apply to Allah is the statement that He, the Mighty and High, is Alone, in the sense that He is Indivisible in Existence [wujud], Intellect [`aql], and Thought [wahm]. That is another dignified description of our Lord, he Mighty and High. The Compiler of this book says: I have heard the following from a person I trust due to the fact that he is religious and due to his mastery of both Classical and colloquial Arabic: Verily, the words one, two three, and so forth, were developed in order to express quantity, and not to express quality. They have no meaning outside of counting, and determining units of measure in the tens, hundreds, and thousands. Likewise, when someone intends to inform another person about the exact quantity of a thing, he names it by its specific name, and applies the number `one’ to it, describing its quantity, as opposed to its attributes. This is why one says: one pound [dirham], and one intends only a pound, while it could be a pound in weight or a pound in number. So, if the persons want to convey the meaning of weight, he would say: one pound in weight, but if he wants to convey the meaning of number, he says; one pound in number. On the basis, if a person says “one man,” the man can be one in the sense that he is one human being, as opposed to two. Or, he could be unique in merits, unique in knowledge, unique in generosity or unique in bravery. Thus, if a person intends to convey the sense of quantity, he says: “one man;” in the sense that he is one man as opposed to two men. However, if he intends to describe someone’s excellence, he says: he is one of a kind (there is no `one’ like him). This indicates that nobody compares to him. If he wanted to stress the knowledge of a person, he would say: he is unique in knowledge. Hence, since the word `one’ can indicate excellence, as well as quantity, it means that whoever called him `one’ under these circumstances meant that there he had no second. In other words, there was no scholar like him, and no person like him in quality. When this is not the case, then it is correct to say that `one’ merely indicates quantity. Otherwise, there, would be no sense in saying `one of a kind’ or limiting the meaning of knowledge or bravery. It has been established that when a person uses the word “one” on its own, it indicates quantity. However, depending on the context, it can also mean “one” or “unique” in knowledge, excellence, and generosity. As we have already explained, `one’ pound [dirham] can be one pound in weight, one pound in number or count. It can also be two pounds in weight, and one pound in number or count. Sometimes it is six dawaniq,1 and sixty fulus,2 and has many fractions. Likewise, a slave can be one salve, and not two slaves; a person can be one person, and not two people, when in reality they are composed of many parts which are composed of many more parts. In this sense, the slave cannot be `one.’ Verily, the slave is not one or unique [wahid], because every slave has someone who is similar to him. It makes perfect sense for a slave to have someone who is the same as him in attributes and qualities. Hence it is necessary that Allah, the Mighty and High, be Unique in His Attributes and Most Beautiful Names. This is what makes Him truly One God, who has no likeness; the One, who has no associates; and there is no god but He. Therefore, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is the One, the Eternal3 [qadim], and there is no god but He. He is Unique, none is eternal but He, the Existing, who does not change, and is not subject to change. He is the One beyond compare. Nothing is similar to Him. Nothing resembles Him. And nothing is like Him. Thus, He is an Indivisible Being in both Essence and Imagination, a Think unlike other Things, and the One and Only True God. There is no god but Him! In conclusion, in Islamic Law, the titles the One [Wahid], and the Unique [Ahad], apply specifically to Him, and are excluded from others. None but Allah, the Mighty and High, can bear these titles. And, as we have already explained, Allah is a name which can only applied to Him. In addition to these examples, a thing can sometimes be counted with something which is similar to it. It is said: this is a man, these are two men, and these are three men; this is a slave, this is black, these are two slaves, these two are black. Therefore, it is not permissible to say: these are two gods as there is no god but the One God. Thus, Allah cannot be counted in this manner, nor does He enter numbers in this form in any way. Sometimes a thing is counted with something different to it. Hence, it is said: this is the color white, these are white and black colors; this is a recent one [muhdath], these are two recent ones; these are not two ones, and these are not two creatures; One of them is Eternal, and the other is recent; one of them is the Lord, and the other is the servant. So, on this basis, it is acceptable to apply numbers to Him as Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said: Nowhere is there a secret counsel between three persons but He is the Fourth of them, not (between) five but He is the Sixth of them, nor less than that nor more but He is with them wheresoever they are.1 Similarly, the statement `Verily’, he is `one man’ does not merely stress his excellence. Likewise, our statement, `so and so in number two to so and so,’ does not simply indicate that he exist. It only does so when it is specified that `he is second to him in excellence, in perfection, or in knowledge.’ As for the Unity of Allah, Exalted is His Remembrance, it refers to the Unity between His Exalted Attribute, and His Most Beautiful Names. He is One, without associates, and without similarity. He who affirms this about the Mighty and High on the basis of His Exalted Attribute and Most Beautiful Names with conviction is a true monotheist. Hence, the one who fails to recognize Allah, the Mighty and High, through his Exalted Attributes, and Most Beautiful Names, does not affirm His Oneness, and is not a true monotheist. Sometimes the ignorant people say: Verily, a monotheist is one who professes the Oneness of Allah even if He does profess the Unity of His Attributes. The ignorant people are told: You have rejected Divine Unity. Whoever claims that His Lord is One God, and One Being, and then applies His Attributes to other than Him, is an idolater, an anthropomorphist, and a nonMuslim according to the consensus of every school of thought in the Ummah. Such is the case, even if he claims that His Lord id One God, One Thing and One Being. Accepting Divine Unity, while failing to accept the Divine Attributes, is like saying Allah is separate from His Attributes whereas Divine Unity is the Unity between Allah and His Attributes. I is impossible for another god to exist. Allah is One God without partners, and without similarity. If He was not United with His Attributes, then he would have an associate or something similar to Him. Likewise, if a servant did not embody him own attributes, another servant would have to exist. As a result, he would not be one servant, but two servants. Hence, anyone who professes that Allah is One with His Attributes is a true monotheist, and a Believer in Divine Unity. Allah, the Mighty and High, unites every attribute which is applicable exclusively to Him. These attributes include the Existent since it cannot be conceive that He can dissolve into something or that something can dissolve into Him. Nor is it conceivable that His Existence can come to an end, that He can be destroyed, or that He can suffer any type of decline. He is the First of the First, the Last of the Last, and the Omnipotent. He is not subject to weakness or inability. He is the Most Powerful of the Powerful, and the Subduer [qahir] of all Subduers. He is Omniscient: nothing is hidden from Him, and nothing escapes Him. He is the Most Learned of the Learned. Ignorance, mistakes, errors, doubts, and forgetfulness cannot be attributed to Him. He is the Ever-Living. He is not subject to sleep or death. Nothing benefits Him nor can anything harm Him. He is the One who Remains, the Most Complete of the Complete, and the Doer who is never occupied. Nothing incapacitates Him nor does He miss anything. He is the Lord of the First and Last, the Best of Creators, and the Foremost of those who take account. He is the Wealthy One [ghani], devoid of nothing. He is the Self-Sufficient [mustaghni], devoid of need. He is the Just, devoid of criticism and defects. He is the Wise One, devoid of foolishness. He is the Most Merciful, whose Mercy cannot be increased kindness.2 He is the Forbearing [halim], devoid of emotion and haste. He is the Most Just of the Just, the Best of Judges, and the Foremost of those who take Account. This is because the first of the First cannot be but One. He is the Omnipotent, the Most Learned, the Best of Judges, the Best of Creators, and all such descriptions are correct. Favor is from Allah, as is protection and guidance.",

When the people gathered around him, he stood up and addressed them in the following terms: All praise be to Allah, the One and Only who is sought by all, the Unique and the One Who was not created out of anything nor created anything out of pre-existing matter. On the contrary, He created everything through His Might which is manifest in all things. And verily, everything came into existence because of Him. He has no attribute which can be comprehended, nor has He any limit which can be established. In linguistic embellishment, the tongue is crippled when it comes to describing His Attributes. And circumlocution with respect to His Attributes leads to a blind alley. The sharpest of intellects are unable to comprehend His Kingdom. All comprehensive explanation is rendered ineffective in delving deep into His Kingdom. Unseen veils impede even the lowest level of understanding of His Hidden Knowledge. The keenest insights are at a loss when attempting to comprehend the most superficial layer of His Subtleties. Thus, hallowed be Allah who can neither be reached by the most intrepid intellect nor conceived by the deepest insight. Exalted be He who is not subject to time, length, or limit. Purified be He whose Beginning has not beginning, whose End has no end, and who will never be annihilated. Glorified be He! He is as He has described Himself, and the describers cannot reach His Descriptions. He delineated the boundaries of all things at the time of their creation, and completely eradicated the possibility of Him resembling things or of things resembling Him. He cannot be contained by things which could describe Him. He has never been separate from things that can describe Him. He has never bin distant from things which could raise questions as to His whereabouts. Rather, He, the Glorified, has encompassed all the things through His Knowledge, strengthened them, and enumerated them in His Memory. Nothing is hidden from Him behind the veils of the atmosphere, the deep slumber which occurs in darkness, and whatever exists in the highest Heavens, and the lowest Earth. Everything that exists has a custodian and a keeper. All things are surrounded by other things. And He encompasses them all. He is the One, the Unique, and the Besought. He is not subject to time. He does not tire from creating thins. Whatever He willed, He said: “Be” and it was. He created everything without precedent, without fatigue, and without planning. Anything which makes something makes it out of something. Allah, however, made His Creation out of nothing. Every scholar acquired knowledge after being ignorant while Allah was never ignorant, and never acquired knowledge. He encompassed all things through His Knowledge even before they were created. Hence, His Knowledge did not increase through their creation. After they came into existence, He knew as much about them as He knew before they came into existence. He never created anything to strengthen His Control. He never created anything out of fear of decay or loss. He never created anything to oppose an adversary. He never created anything to match an equal. He never created anything to become the equal of a dominating partner. He never did anything of the like because all of creation is nurtured by Him, and all things that exist are His Humble Slaves and Servants. Glorified be He who never feels weary from creating, and sustaining. And glorified be He who was not prevented from creating more out of inability or laziness. He knew what He created, and created what He knew. Whatever He created was not the result of deliberation or based on new knowledge. Nor does any doubt arise in Him regarding the things He has not created. What He created, and what He did not create, was the result of His Inviolable Decision. His Firm Knowledge, and His Exact Command. He made Himself Unique in His Lordship, and Specific in (His) Oneness. He earmarked glory and praise for Himself, made Himself Peerless in Unity, Grandeur and Sublimity. He remains Matchless in Praise, and Exalted in His Glory. He is far above parenthood. And he is purified and sanctified against the feminine touch (i.e. sexual relations). He is far too Great and too Mighty to seek the proximity of any participant. Thus, nothing He has created can oppose Him. There is no equal to Him in His Possessions, and there is no partner for Him in His Kingdom. He is the One, the Unique, and the Besought of all. He is the Eternal, the Everlasting, and the Lord of Space. He has always been, and always will be. He is Unique in Eternity. He existed before time and will exist after the end of all affairs. He will never come to an end nor be exhausted. This is how I describe my Lord. Thus, there is no god but Allah. He is the Greatest of the Great. Glorified and Exalted be He. He is the Mightiest of the Mighty. He is far, far, above what the unjust claim about Him. And Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Saqar al-Sa`igh also said this sermon that Muhammad ibn al- `Abbas ibn Bassam said: Abu Zayd Sa`id ibn Muhammad al-Basri related to me that `Umrah bint Aws related to me that My grandfather al-Husayn ibn `Abd al-Rahman related to me on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu `Ad Allah Ja’’far ibn Muhammad (AS), on the authority of his father on the authority of his grandfather (AS) that the Commander of the Faithful (AS) addressed this sermon when he roused the people to the war with Mu`awiyah for the second time.",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "3. `Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn `Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Muhammad ibn Abu `Abd Allah al-Kufi said; and (also) Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakariyya al-Qittan, on the authority of Bakr ibn `Abd Allah ibn Habib, on the authority of Tamim ibn Buhlul, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu Mu`awiyah, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Abd al-Rahman, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu `Abd Allah (AS) on the authority of his father, on the authority of his grandfather (AS) that ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "The Commander of the Faithful (AS) roused the people to was with Mu`awiyah for the second time. When the people gathered around him, he stood up and addressed them in the following terms: All praise be to Allah, the One and Only who is sought by all, the Unique and the One Who was not created out of anything nor created anything out of pre-existing matter. On the contrary, He created everything through His Might which is manifest in all things. And verily, everything came into existence because of Him. He has no attribute which can be comprehended, nor has He any limit which can be established. In linguistic embellishment, the tongue is crippled when it comes to describing His Attributes. And circumlocution with respect to His Attributes leads to a blind alley. The sharpest of intellects are unable to comprehend His Kingdom. All comprehensive explanation is rendered ineffective in delving deep into His Kingdom. Unseen veils impede even the lowest level of understanding of His Hidden Knowledge. The keenest insights are at a loss when attempting to comprehend the most superficial layer of His Subtleties. Thus, hallowed be Allah who can neither be reached by the most intrepid intellect nor conceived by the deepest insight. Exalted be He who is not subject to time, length, or limit. Purified be He whose Beginning has not beginning, whose End has no end, and who will never be annihilated. Glorified be He! He is as He has described Himself, and the describers cannot reach His Descriptions. He delineated the boundaries of all things at the time of their creation, and completely eradicated the possibility of Him resembling things or of things resembling Him. He cannot be contained by things which could describe Him. He has never been separate from things that can describe Him. He has never bin distant from things which could raise questions as to His whereabouts. Rather, He, the Glorified, has encompassed all the things through His Knowledge, strengthened them, and enumerated them in His Memory. Nothing is hidden from Him behind the veils of the atmosphere, the deep slumber which occurs in darkness, and whatever exists in the highest Heavens, and the lowest Earth. Everything that exists has a custodian and a keeper. All things are surrounded by other things. And He encompasses them all. He is the One, the Unique, and the Besought. He is not subject to time. He does not tire from creating thins. Whatever He willed, He said: “Be” and it was. He created everything without precedent, without fatigue, and without planning. Anything which makes something makes it out of something. Allah, however, made His Creation out of nothing. Every scholar acquired knowledge after being ignorant while Allah was never ignorant, and never acquired knowledge. He encompassed all things through His Knowledge even before they were created. Hence, His Knowledge did not increase through their creation. After they came into existence, He knew as much about them as He knew before they came into existence. He never created anything to strengthen His Control. He never created anything out of fear of decay or loss. He never created anything to oppose an adversary. He never created anything to match an equal. He never created anything to become the equal of a dominating partner. He never did anything of the like because all of creation is nurtured by Him, and all things that exist are His Humble Slaves and Servants. Glorified be He who never feels weary from creating, and sustaining. And glorified be He who was not prevented from creating more out of inability or laziness. He knew what He created, and created what He knew. Whatever He created was not the result of deliberation or based on new knowledge. Nor does any doubt arise in Him regarding the things He has not created. What He created, and what He did not create, was the result of His Inviolable Decision. His Firm Knowledge, and His Exact Command. He made Himself Unique in His Lordship, and Specific in (His) Oneness. He earmarked glory and praise for Himself, made Himself Peerless in Unity, Grandeur and Sublimity. He remains Matchless in Praise, and Exalted in His Glory. He is far above parenthood. And he is purified and sanctified against the feminine touch (i.e. sexual relations). He is far too Great and too Mighty to seek the proximity of any participant. Thus, nothing He has created can oppose Him. There is no equal to Him in His Possessions, and there is no partner for Him in His Kingdom. He is the One, the Unique, and the Besought of all. He is the Eternal, the Everlasting, and the Lord of Space. He has always been, and always will be. He is Unique in Eternity. He existed before time and will exist after the end of all affairs. He will never come to an end nor be exhausted. This is how I describe my Lord. Thus, there is no god but Allah. He is the Greatest of the Great. Glorified and Exalted be He. He is the Mightiest of the Mighty. He is far, far, above what the unjust claim about Him. And Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Saqar al-Sa`igh also said this sermon that Muhammad ibn al- `Abbas ibn Bassam said: Abu Zayd Sa`id ibn Muhammad al-Basri related to me that `Umrah bint Aws related to me that My grandfather al-Husayn ibn `Abd al-Rahman related to me on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu `Ad Allah Ja’’far ibn Muhammad (AS), on the authority of his father on the authority of his grandfather (AS) that the Commander of the Faithful (AS) addressed this sermon when he roused the people to the war with Mu`awiyah for the second time.",

    "englishText": "32. Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (RA) said: `Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Sa`dabadi said: Ahmad ibn Abu `Abd Allah al-Barqi said, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Sinan, on the authority of Ziyad ibn al-Mundhar, on the authority of Sa`d ibn Tarif, on the authority of al-Asbagh ibn Nubatah that The Commander of the Faithful (AS) said the following concerning the decree: Beware that the decree is a secret from the secrets of Allah, concealment from the concealments of Allah, and a sanctuary from the sanctuaries of Allah. It is raised to the covering of Allah, folded up from the creation of Allah, sealed with the seal of Allah, and precedent in the knowledge of Allah. Allah has taken of its knowledge from the servants, raised it above their witnessing and level of intellect because they cannot attain it with the reality of the Lordship or the power of the Needless. Neither can they attain the greatness of the Light, nor the honor of the solitary, because it is an overflowing ocean purely for Allah, the Exalted. Its depth is between the heaven and the earth, and its width is between the east and the West. It is as dark as the pitch- dark night, full of snakes and fishes. It rises at one time ad drops at another. In its bottom, the sun shines. It ought to be that no one has its information except Allah the One, the Peerless. Thus, whoever becomes informed of I becomes contrary to Allah, the Mighty and High in His Judgement and contest Him in His Rule. He uncovers His Concealment and secret, and buys the anger of Allah. His abode is Hell, and it is the worst place of arrival. The Compiler of this book says, we believe: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has predestined and decreed the good and evil of His Servants, and all that is in the universe. The decree can be in the meaning of information, like Allah, the Mighty and High says: And We had decreed to the children of Israel in the Book. He means that We made known to them. Like Allah, the Mighty and High, says: And We revealed to him this decree, that the roots of these shall be cut off in the morning. He means that We informed him and made it known to him. Therefore, it cannot be refused that Allah the Mighty and High, decrees the actions of the servants and all that which is of good and evil in this meaning, because Allah, the Mighty and High, is the Knower of it all. It is correct that He may give knowledge to any of His servants and inform them of it. The decree can also be in the meaning of writing and informing, like Allah, the Mighty and High, says: Except his wife; We decreed that she shall surely be of those who remain behind; i.e. We prescribed and informed. Al-`Ajjaj said: Be informed that the Glorified has decree In the earlier scriptures that He wrote. `He decreed’ means He wrote. The decree can sometimes be in the meaning of the rule and necessity. Allah, the Mighty and High, says: And your Lord has destined that you shall not serve (any) but Him, and goodness to your parents. He means that He has ordained that and made it necessary on His Creation. It may also be possible to say that Allah, the Mighty and High, has destined the actions of the servants in this meaning. What He made necessary for His Servants and ordered them to do are obligations. It is also possible that the meaning is: Allah has set a measurement for the actions of the servants to explain its measurements and states of good and evil, obligatory and supererogatory, and other things. He gives reasons fro what makes the states of these actions recognized. Therefore, the Mighty and High is the One that sets the measurements, but to explain them to other than Himself who do not know the state of what He has destined in their measurements. This is apparent and not hidden. It is very clear that it does not require any proofs over it. Is it not so that when we go to the skilled people in measurements, their knowledge of measurements does not stop them from setting measurements to explain to us their measurements? Verily, we reject that Allah, the Mighty and High, has ordained His Servants with this and forbidden them from abstention from this. Or that He has done it and created it. As Allah, the Mighty and High, has created them a measured creation, so we do not reject that. I heard some learned ones says: Verily, the destiny [al-Qada’] has ten different meanings: The first of them is `to know’ according to the Word of Alah, the Mighty and High: But (it was only) a desire in the soul of Ya`qub which he destined, i.e. He knew. The second meaning is `to inform’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And We had decreed to the children of Israel in the Book, and the Word of the Mighty and High: And We revealed to him this decree, i.e. We informed him. The third is `to judge’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High is: And Allah decrees with the truth, i.e. He judges with the truth. The fourth meaning is `to say’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And Allah decrees with the truth, i.e. He says the truth. The firth is `to determine definitely’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: But when We decreed death for him, i.e. We determined definitely. So I is the definite decree. The sixth is `to command’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And your Lord has destined that you shall not serve (any) but Him, i.e. your Lord has commanded. The seventh is `to create’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: So He decreed them seven heavens in two periods, i.e. he created them. The eight is `to do’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Therefore, decree what you are going to decree, i.e. do what you are doing. The ninth is `to accomplish’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: So when Musa had decreed the term; and the Word of the Mighty and High, accounting Musa Whichever of the two terms I decree, there shall be no wrongdoing to me; and Allah is a witness of what we say, i.e. I accomplish. The tenth is `to conclude from something’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High The matter is decreed concerning which you enquired, i.e. it is concluded from it for you two. It is the Word of a person what I have decreed your requirement for you, i.e. I have concluded it for you. Therefore, it is possible to say that the things in their entirety are with the destiny of Allah and His Decree, Blessed and Exalted be He. This is in the meaning that Allah, the Mighty and High, knows it and know it measures, and that He has a judgment for all of it, either the good or evil. Therefore, whatever is good He decreed it in the meaning that He commanded it, determined it definitely, and made it true. He knew its extent and measure. Whatever is evil, He did not command it, and is not pleased with it. However, He destined it, and decreed it in the sense that He knows its measure and extent, and has judged according to His Judgement. The word [al-fitnah] has ten different meanings: One of them is `misguidance.’ The second is `to put to the test’ according to the Word of Allah: And We tried you with (a severe) trying, i.e. We have put you to a test; and the Word of the Mighty and High: Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, We believe, and not be tried? i.e. they will not be put to a test. The third is `to make excuse’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Then their excuse would be nothing but that they would say: By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists. The fourth is `to believe in polytheism’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And polytheism is severer than murder. The fifth is `to disbelieve’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely into trial have they already tumbled down, i.e. into disbelief. The sixth is `to burn with fire’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely (as for) those who persecute the believing men and the believing women, i.e. they burn. The seventh is `to punish’ according the Word of the Mighty and High: (It is) the day on which they shall be tried at the fire, i.e. they shall be punished. The Word of the Mighty and High: Taste your trial! This is what you would hasten on, i.e. your punishment. And the Word of the Mighty and High: And as for him whose trial Allah desired, you cannot control anything fro him with Allah, i.e. whose punishment. The eight is `to kill’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: If you fear that hose who disbelieve will cause you distress, i.e. if you fear that they will kill you. Also the Word of the Mighty and High: But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people, on account of the fear of Fir`awn and their chiefs, lest he should persecute them, i.e. he may kill them. The ninth is `to turn away’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And surely they had purposed to try you in that which We have revealed to you, i.e. to turn you away. The tenth is `a severe trial’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Our Lord! Do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve. And the Word of the Mighty and High is: Our Lord! Make us not subject to the persecution of the unjust people, i.e. a severe trial with which they may cause mischief. They say about themselves: Nothing has killed them except the fact that their religion is void, and our religion is true. Therefore, it invites them to Hell due to their disbelief and oppression. `Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim has added to these ten meanings another possibility that one of the meanings of the word fitnah is love according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And know that your property and your children are a temptation, i.e. love. In my opinion, there are ten meanings to this verse. Fitnah is this context means `a severe trial’ and not love. The confirmation of that is the tradition of the Prophet (SA), “The son, takes after the father in ignorance, trial and miserliness.” I have extracted this tradition with transmission in the book Maqtal al-Husayn ibn `Ali, blessings be upon them both.",
    "arabicText": "32 - حدثنا محمد بن موسى بن المتوكل رحمه الله، قال: حدثنا علي بن الحسين السعدآبادي، قال: حدثنا أحمد بن أبي عبد الله البرقي، عن أبيه، عن محمد بن سنان، عن زياد بن المنذر، عن سعد بن طريف، عن الأصبغ بن نباته، قال: قال أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام في القدر: ألا إن القدر سر من سر الله، وستر من ستر الله، وحرز من حرز الله، مرفوع في حجاب الله، مطوي عن خلق الله، مختوم بخاتم الله، سابق في علم الله، وضع الله العباد عن علمه  ورفعه فوق شهاداتهم ومبلغ عقولهم لأنهم لا ينالونه بحقيقة الربانية ولا بقدرة الصمدانية ولا بعظمة النورانية ولا بعزة الوحدانية، لأنه بحر زاخر خالص لله تعالى، عمقه ما بين السماء و الأرض، عرضه ما بين المشرق والمغرب، أسود كالليل الدامس، كثير الحيات و الحيتان، يعلو مرة ويسفل أخرى، في قعره شمس تضيئ، لا ينبغي أن يطلع إليها إلا الله الواحد الفرد، فمن تطلع إليها فقد ضاد الله عز وجل في حكمه ونازعه في سلطانه، وكشف عن ستره وسره، وباء بغضب من الله ومأواه جهنم وبئس المصير. قال المصنف هذا الكتاب نقول: إن الله تبارك وتعالى قد قضى جميع أعمال العباد وقدرها وجميع ما يكون في العالم من خير وشر، والقضاء قد يكون بمعنى الأعلام كما قال الله عز وجل: ﴿وقضينا إلى بني إسرائيل في الكتاب﴾ (١) يريد أعلمناهم، وكما قال الله عز وجل: ﴿وقضينا إليه ذلك الأمر أن دابر هؤلاء مقطوع مصبحين﴾ (٢) يريد أخبرناه وأعلمناه، فلا ينكر أن يكون الله عز وجل يقضي أعمال العباد و سائر ما يكون من خير وشر على هذا المعنى لأن الله عز وجل عالم بها أجمع. ويصح أن يعلمها عباده ويخبرهم عنها، وقد يكون القدر أيضا في معنى الكتاب والإخبار كما قال الله عز وجل: ﴿إلا امرأته قدرنا إنها لمن الغابرين)﴾ (٣) يعني كتبنا وأخبرنا، وقال العجاج: واعلم بأن ذا الجلال قد قدر * في الصحف الأولى التي كان سطر و (قدر) معناه كتب. وقد يكون القضاء بمعنى الحكم والالزام، قال الله عز وجل ﴿وقضى ربك ألا تعبدوا إلا إياه وبالوالدين إحسانا﴾  يريد حكم بذلك وألزمه خلقه، فقد يجوز أن يقال: إن الله عز وجل قد قضى من أعمال العباد على هذا المعنى ما قد ألزمه عباده وحكم به عليهم وهي الفرائض دون غيرها، وقد يجوز أيضا أن يقدر الله أعمال العباد بأن يبين مقاديرها وأحوالها من حسن وقبح وفرض و نافلة وغير ذلك، ويفعل من الأدلة على ذلك ما يعرف به هذه الأحوال لهذه الأفعال فيكون عز وجل مقدرا لها في الحقيقة، وليس يقدرها ليعرف مقدارها، ولكن ليبين لغيره ممن لا يعرف ذلك حال ما قدره بتقديره إياه، وهذا أظهر من أن يخفى، وأبين من أن يحتاج إلى الاستشهاد عليه، ألا ترى أنا قد نرجع إلى أهل المعرفة بالصناعات في تقديرها لنا فلا يمنعهم علمهم بمقاديرها من أن يقدروها لنا ليبينوا لنا مقاديرها، وإنما أنكرنا أن يكون الله عز وجل حكم بها على عباده ومنعهم من الانصراف عنها، أو أن يكون فعلها وكونها، فأما أن يكون الله عز وجل خلقها خلق تقدير فلا ننكره. وسمعت بعض أهل العلم يقول: إن القضاء على عشرة أوجه: فأول وجه منها العلم وهو قول الله عز وجل: ﴿إلا حاجة في نفس يعقوب قضاها﴾ (١) يعني علمها. والثاني الإعلام وهو قوله عز وجل: (وقضينا إلى بني إسرائيل في الكتاب) وقوله عز وجل: (وقضينا إليه ذلك الأمر) أي أعلمناه. والثالث الحكم وهو قوله عز وجل. (والله يقضي بالحق) (٢) أي يحكم بالحق. والرابع القول وهو قوله عز وجل: (والله يقضي بالحق) (٣) أي يقول الحق. والخامس الحتم وهو قوله عز وجل: (فلما قضينا عليه الموت) (٤) يعني حتمنا، فهو القضاء الحتم. والسادس الأمر وهو قوله عز وجل: (وقضى ربك ألا تعبدوا إلا إياه) يعني أمر ربك. والسابع الخلق وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿فقضيهن سبع سماوات في يومين﴾  يعني خلقهن. والثامن الفعل وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿فاقض ما أنت قاض﴾ (١) أي افعل ما أنت فاعل. والتاسع الاتمام وهو قوله عز وجل: (فلما قضى موسى الأجل) وقوله عز وجل حكاية عن موسى: ﴿أيما الأجلين قضيت فلا عدوان علي والله على ما نقول وكيل﴾ (٢) أي أتممت. والعاشر الفراغ من الشئ وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿قضي الأمر الذي فيه تستفتيان﴾ (٣) يعني فرغ لكما منه، وقوله القائل: قد قضيت لك حاجتك، يعني فرغت لك منها، فيجوز أن يقال: إن الأشياء كلها بقضاء الله وقدره تبارك وتعال بمعنى أن الله عز وجل قد علمها وعلم مقاديرها، وله عز وجل في جميعها حكم من خير أو شر، فما كان من خير فقد قضاه بمعنى أنه أمر به وحتمه وجعله حقا وعلم مبلغة ومقداره، وما كان من شر فلم يأمر به ولم يرضه ولكنه عز وجل قد قضاه وقدره بمعنى أنه علمه بمقداره ومبلغه وحكم فيه بحكمه. والفتنة على عشرة أوجه فوجه منها الضلال. والثاني الاختبار وهو قول الله عز وجل: ﴿وفتناك فتونا﴾ (٤) يعني اختبرناك اختبارا، وقوله عز وجل: ﴿ألم أحسب الناس أن يتركوا أن يقولوا آمنا وهم لا يفتنون﴾ (٥) أي لا يختبرون. والثالث الحجة وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿ثم لم تكن فتنتهم إلا أن قالوا والله ربنا ما كنا مشركين﴾ (٦). والرابع الشرك وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿والفتنة أشد من القتل﴾ . والخامس الكفر وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿ألا في الفتنة سقطوا﴾ (١) يعني في الكفر. والسادس الاحراق بالنار وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿إن الذين فتنوا المؤمنين والمؤمنات - الآية﴾ (٢) يعني أحرقوا. والسابع وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿يوم هم على النار يفتنون﴾ (٣) يعني يعذبون، وقوله عز وجل: ﴿ذوقوا فتنتكم هذا الذي كنتم به تكذبون﴾ (٤) يعني عذابكم، وقوله عز وجل: (ومن يرد الله فتنته (يعني عذابه) فلن تملك له من الله شيئا) (٥). والثامن القتل وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿إن خفتم أن يفتنكم الذين كفروا﴾ (٦) يعني إن خفتم أن يقتلوكم، وقوله عز وجل: ﴿فما آمن لموسى إلا ذرية من قومه على خوف من فرعون وملأهم أن يفتنهم﴾ (٧) يعني أن يقتلهم. والتاسع الصد وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿وإن كادوا ليفتنونك عن الذي أوحينا إليك﴾ (٨) يعني ليصدونك. والعاشر شدة المحنة وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿ربنا لا تجعلنا فتنة للذين كفروا﴾ (٩) وقوله عز وجل: ﴿ربنا لا تجعلنا فتنة للقوم الظالمين﴾  أي محنة فيفتنوا بذلك ويقولوا في أنفسهم: لم يقتلهم إلا دينهم الباطل وديننا الحق  فيكون ذلك داعيا لهم إلى النار على ما هم عليه من الكفر والظلم . قد زاد علي بن إبراهيم بن هاشم على هذه الوجوه العشرة وجها آخر فقال: من وجوه الفتنة ما هو المحبة وهو قوله عز وجل: ﴿أنما أموالكم وأولادكم فتنة﴾  أي محبة، والذي عندي في ذلك أن وجوه الفتنة عشرة وأن الفتنة في هذا الموضع أيضا المحنة - بالنون - لا المحبة - بالباء -. وتصديق ذلك قول النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم (الولد مجهلة محنة مبخلة)  وقد أخرجت هذا الحديث مسندا في كتاب مقتل الحسين بن علي صلى الله عليهما.

    "thaqalaynSanad": "32. Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (RA) said: `Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Sa`dabadi said: Ahmad ibn Abu `Abd Allah al-Barqi said, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Sinan, on the authority of Ziyad ibn al-Mundhar, on the authority of Sa`d ibn Tarif, on the authority of al-Asbagh ibn Nubatah that The Commander of the Faithful (AS) said the following concerning the decree: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "Beware that the decree is a secret from the secrets of Allah, concealment from the concealments of Allah, and a sanctuary from the sanctuaries of Allah. It is raised to the covering of Allah, folded up from the creation of Allah, sealed with the seal of Allah, and precedent in the knowledge of Allah. Allah has taken of its knowledge from the servants, raised it above their witnessing and level of intellect because they cannot attain it with the reality of the Lordship or the power of the Needless. Neither can they attain the greatness of the Light, nor the honor of the solitary, because it is an overflowing ocean purely for Allah, the Exalted. Its depth is between the heaven and the earth, and its width is between the east and the West. It is as dark as the pitch- dark night, full of snakes and fishes. It rises at one time ad drops at another. In its bottom, the sun shines. It ought to be that no one has its information except Allah the One, the Peerless. Thus, whoever becomes informed of I becomes contrary to Allah, the Mighty and High in His Judgement and contest Him in His Rule. He uncovers His Concealment and secret, and buys the anger of Allah. His abode is Hell, and it is the worst place of arrival. The Compiler of this book says, we believe: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has predestined and decreed the good and evil of His Servants, and all that is in the universe. The decree can be in the meaning of information, like Allah, the Mighty and High says: And We had decreed to the children of Israel in the Book. He means that We made known to them. Like Allah, the Mighty and High, says: And We revealed to him this decree, that the roots of these shall be cut off in the morning. He means that We informed him and made it known to him. Therefore, it cannot be refused that Allah the Mighty and High, decrees the actions of the servants and all that which is of good and evil in this meaning, because Allah, the Mighty and High, is the Knower of it all. It is correct that He may give knowledge to any of His servants and inform them of it. The decree can also be in the meaning of writing and informing, like Allah, the Mighty and High, says: Except his wife; We decreed that she shall surely be of those who remain behind; i.e. We prescribed and informed. Al-`Ajjaj said: Be informed that the Glorified has decree In the earlier scriptures that He wrote. `He decreed’ means He wrote. The decree can sometimes be in the meaning of the rule and necessity. Allah, the Mighty and High, says: And your Lord has destined that you shall not serve (any) but Him, and goodness to your parents. He means that He has ordained that and made it necessary on His Creation. It may also be possible to say that Allah, the Mighty and High, has destined the actions of the servants in this meaning. What He made necessary for His Servants and ordered them to do are obligations. It is also possible that the meaning is: Allah has set a measurement for the actions of the servants to explain its measurements and states of good and evil, obligatory and supererogatory, and other things. He gives reasons fro what makes the states of these actions recognized. Therefore, the Mighty and High is the One that sets the measurements, but to explain them to other than Himself who do not know the state of what He has destined in their measurements. This is apparent and not hidden. It is very clear that it does not require any proofs over it. Is it not so that when we go to the skilled people in measurements, their knowledge of measurements does not stop them from setting measurements to explain to us their measurements? Verily, we reject that Allah, the Mighty and High, has ordained His Servants with this and forbidden them from abstention from this. Or that He has done it and created it. As Allah, the Mighty and High, has created them a measured creation, so we do not reject that. I heard some learned ones says: Verily, the destiny [al-Qada’] has ten different meanings: The first of them is `to know’ according to the Word of Alah, the Mighty and High: But (it was only) a desire in the soul of Ya`qub which he destined, i.e. He knew. The second meaning is `to inform’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And We had decreed to the children of Israel in the Book, and the Word of the Mighty and High: And We revealed to him this decree, i.e. We informed him. The third is `to judge’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High is: And Allah decrees with the truth, i.e. He judges with the truth. The fourth meaning is `to say’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And Allah decrees with the truth, i.e. He says the truth. The firth is `to determine definitely’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: But when We decreed death for him, i.e. We determined definitely. So I is the definite decree. The sixth is `to command’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And your Lord has destined that you shall not serve (any) but Him, i.e. your Lord has commanded. The seventh is `to create’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: So He decreed them seven heavens in two periods, i.e. he created them. The eight is `to do’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Therefore, decree what you are going to decree, i.e. do what you are doing. The ninth is `to accomplish’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: So when Musa had decreed the term; and the Word of the Mighty and High, accounting Musa Whichever of the two terms I decree, there shall be no wrongdoing to me; and Allah is a witness of what we say, i.e. I accomplish. The tenth is `to conclude from something’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High The matter is decreed concerning which you enquired, i.e. it is concluded from it for you two. It is the Word of a person what I have decreed your requirement for you, i.e. I have concluded it for you. Therefore, it is possible to say that the things in their entirety are with the destiny of Allah and His Decree, Blessed and Exalted be He. This is in the meaning that Allah, the Mighty and High, knows it and know it measures, and that He has a judgment for all of it, either the good or evil. Therefore, whatever is good He decreed it in the meaning that He commanded it, determined it definitely, and made it true. He knew its extent and measure. Whatever is evil, He did not command it, and is not pleased with it. However, He destined it, and decreed it in the sense that He knows its measure and extent, and has judged according to His Judgement. The word [al-fitnah] has ten different meanings: One of them is `misguidance.’ The second is `to put to the test’ according to the Word of Allah: And We tried you with (a severe) trying, i.e. We have put you to a test; and the Word of the Mighty and High: Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, We believe, and not be tried? i.e. they will not be put to a test. The third is `to make excuse’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Then their excuse would be nothing but that they would say: By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists. The fourth is `to believe in polytheism’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And polytheism is severer than murder. The fifth is `to disbelieve’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely into trial have they already tumbled down, i.e. into disbelief. The sixth is `to burn with fire’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely (as for) those who persecute the believing men and the believing women, i.e. they burn. The seventh is `to punish’ according the Word of the Mighty and High: (It is) the day on which they shall be tried at the fire, i.e. they shall be punished. The Word of the Mighty and High: Taste your trial! This is what you would hasten on, i.e. your punishment. And the Word of the Mighty and High: And as for him whose trial Allah desired, you cannot control anything fro him with Allah, i.e. whose punishment. The eight is `to kill’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: If you fear that hose who disbelieve will cause you distress, i.e. if you fear that they will kill you. Also the Word of the Mighty and High: But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people, on account of the fear of Fir`awn and their chiefs, lest he should persecute them, i.e. he may kill them. The ninth is `to turn away’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And surely they had purposed to try you in that which We have revealed to you, i.e. to turn you away. The tenth is `a severe trial’ according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Our Lord! Do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve. And the Word of the Mighty and High is: Our Lord! Make us not subject to the persecution of the unjust people, i.e. a severe trial with which they may cause mischief. They say about themselves: Nothing has killed them except the fact that their religion is void, and our religion is true. Therefore, it invites them to Hell due to their disbelief and oppression. `Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim has added to these ten meanings another possibility that one of the meanings of the word fitnah is love according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And know that your property and your children are a temptation, i.e. love. In my opinion, there are ten meanings to this verse. Fitnah is this context means `a severe trial’ and not love. The confirmation of that is the tradition of the Prophet (SA), “The son, takes after the father in ignorance, trial and miserliness.” I have extracted this tradition with transmission in the book Maqtal al-Husayn ibn `Ali, blessings be upon them both.",

    "englishText": "33-1 Muhammad ibn Ali Majilawayh - may God have Mercy upon him - narrated that his uncle Muhammad ibn Abil Qasim quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abi Abdillah al-Kufi, on the authority of Muhammad ibn San’an, and also Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq, Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-San’ani, Ali ibn Abdullah al-Var’raq and Al-Husayn ibn Ibrahim ibn Ahmad ibn Hisham al-Mokattib - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Muhammad ibnAli al-Kufi quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Isma’il, on the authority of Ali ibn Al-Abbas, on the authority of Al-Qasim ibn Al-Rabi’a As-Sah’haf, on the authority of Muhammad ibn San’an, and also Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Abdullah Al-Barqi, Ali ibn Isa - the neighbor to the Kufa Mosque, and Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Musa - may God have Mercy upon them - narrated that Muhammad ibn Ali Majilawayh, quoted on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn San’an that Abal Hassan Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) wrote the following reasons (behind the decrees) in response to Muhammad ibn San’an’s questions:And the reason behind the obligatory ritual ablution (ghusl) for the major ritual impurity is to cleanse and purify man’s self from what has impurified him. And another reason is to purify the rest of the body from impurities as impurities have come out from all over the body. That is why it is obligatory to clean the whole body.And the reason behind the lesser decree about urination and defecation is the frequency of these acts compared to that of the major ritual impurity, the hardships involved, and the fact that there is no will in doing these acts and there is no lust involved in doing them. However, there is lust in major ritual impurity and it is the result of an intentional act.And the reasons behind the ritual ablution on the two major festivals and on Fridays, and other cases is to express a servant’s honoring of his Lord, prepare himself for Him - the Glorious the Magnificent to ask Him to forgive his sins. Another reason is that they are the holidays which are known to be for congregations in remembrance of the Sublime God. Therefore, God has established the ritual ablution on these days as a way to honor these days and to make them superior to other days - days in which many recommendable prayers are said, much servitude is expressed, and it is a way of purification from one Friday to the next.And the reason behind the major ablution for the dead is to cleanse the corpse from the various filth, illnesses and other things that might have fallen upon him, since the dead person is going to meet the angels and associate with the people of the Hereafter.It is highly desirable for him to be clean and pure now that he is going to meet God and the Pure Ones where they will touch him and he will touch them. This is so that the Pure Ones may ask the Honorable the Exalted God to forgive him and they may intercede on his behalf.And another reason behind the major ablution for the dead is that once he dies, the sperm with which he was at first created with will be discharged from his body and he will be in a state of major ritual impurity. Thus others must perform the major ablution for him.And the reason why once you perform the major ritual ablution for the dead or touch someone’s corpse you must perform the major ritual ablution yourself is to be cleansed of the filth from the corpse that might have touched your body. That is because once someone dies and his soul departs from the body, most of the impurities remain in his body. Therefore, one must do so to get cleaned and purified therefrom. And the reason behind making minor ablutions (wudu) - in which it is prescribed to wash the face, the two arms, rubbing the head, and rubbing the upper side of the feet - is that man wants to stand in front of the Honorable the Exalted God, facing Him and visiting the Honorable Recorders (Kiram Katibin) with all his apparent body parts. Then washing the face is for prostration and humbleness, washing the two arms is for preparing them to be held up towards the heavens, implore and fear God with them and use them to sincerely turn towards the worship of God. The rubbing of the head and the feet is because they are apparent in all positions of the prayer and in them there is not as much humbleness and sincerity of worship as there is in the face and the two hands.And the reason behind the alms-tax is to aid the poor and protect the properties of the rich, as the Blessed the Sublime God has ordained that the healthy assist those afflicted with calamities. As the Sublime God has said, ‘Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves…’ The way you are tried by your possessions is by paying the alms-tax, and the way you are tried by your personal selves is by getting yourselves prepared to be patient during calamities. In paying the alms-tax there is a fulfillment of gratitude for the blessings granted to us by the Honorable the Exalted God, an eagerness to have more of them, kindness and mercy for the weak, and kindness with the poor. And also there is an increased inclination towards sympathizing with the poor; assisting the poor and helping them regarding their religious affairs and a lesson for the rich to take heed to seeing their poorness in the Hereafter; and encouragement to thank the Blessed the Sublime God for what He has bestowed upon us and hasmade us needless of. And also there is an encouragement to pray, cry, and fear that we may become poor like them one day. And also there is an encouragement in performing many deeds similar to paying the alms-tax such as charity, visiting the relatives and being kind to others.And the reason behind the Hajj pilgrimage is that it is a form of getting near to God, asking Him for extensive rewards, departing from all the sins that one has committed, to be repentant for all that he has done in the past, and to start what he will do in the future. The pilgrimage is also for experiencing the expenditures of his wealth and exert himself; avoiding lust and pleasure so as to seek nearness to the Honorable the Exalted God. The pilgrimage is also for feeling humility and courtesy; suffering from the difficulties of the trip in the various conditions of heat, cold, security and fear for a long span of time. The benefits in the Hajj pilgrimage for the people include asking the Honorable the Exalted God for the fulfillment of our needs; abandoning relentlessness of the heart; abandoning the daring of the self; abandoning forgetfulness to remember God; abandoning lack of hope and engaging in action; renewal of the rights; preventing the self from getting corrupt; benefiting the people in the East or the West of the Earth - whether they live in the deserts or at sea; whether they partake in the Hajj pilgrimage or not; whether they import things; whether they do business with men (a.s.ell or buy); and whether they are dealers or needy men. It also includes the fulfillment of the needs of the people who live in that vicinity where the Hajj pilgrims gather together as God has said, ‘That they may witness the benefits (provided) for them.’And the reason behind the obligation of going on the Hajj pilgrimage once (in the lifetime) is that the Honorable the Exalted God has considered the least powerful of the people in establishing the obligatory deeds (they only need to go once). One of these obligations is the Hajj pilgrimage which is obligatory once. God has encouraged the powerful people to go as often as they can.And the reason behind establishing the House (of God) in the middle of the Earth is that it is the place where land at first came out of water. All the winds that blow in the world start from there at the point beneath the ‘al-Rokn ash-Shami. The House of God was the first mausoleum established on the Earth. Therefore, it is the center and the religiouspilgrimage obligation for all the people whether they are from the East or the West. Mecca was so named because the people used to whistle there, and they called whoever intended to go there as he whistled. This is clear from the Words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘Their prayer at the House (of God) is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands…’ Here the word ‘Mecca used in the verse in Arabic means whistling and the word ‘Tasdiyah used in the verse in Arabic means clapping.And the reason behind the circumambulation around the House (of God) is that the Blessed the Sublime God told the angels, ‘I will create a vicegerent on earth.’ They said, ‘Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?…’ They gave this reply to the Sublime God, but then they became sorry, took refuge in the Throne and repented. The Honorable the Exalted God desired that other servants worship in a similar fashion just like the angels. Therefore, He founded a House parallel to the Throne in the Fourth Heaven called ‘Az-Zorah. Then He founded another House in the Heavens of this world parallel to ‘Az-Zorah called ‘Al-Bayt al-Ma’mur. Then He founded this House parallel to ‘Al-Bayt al-Ma’mur. Then He ordered Adam (a.s.) to circumambulate around it. Then the Honorable the Exalted God forgave him and this became a practice for his progeny all the way up until the Resurrection Day.And the reason behind kissing or touching the Black Stone is that when the Blessed the Sublime God made a covenant with the children of Adam, the Black Stone swallowed it and thus made the people obliged to honor this covenant. That is near the Black Stone they must say, ‘This is what I was entrusted with and I fulfilled it. This is my covenant and I honored it. Therefore, bear witness that I honored my covenant.’ The same meaning lies in Salman’s words, ‘On the Resurrection Day the Black Stone will appear like Mount Abi Qays with a tongue. It will testify on behalf of whoever has visited it.’And the reason behind naming Mina (meaning beg) is that Gabriel descended to Abraham and said, ‘Beg your Lord for something.’ Then Abraham asked that God establish the offering of a sheep instead of offering his son Ishmael, and God order that the sheep be slaughtered for Him. Then this request was granted.And the reason behind fasting is the realization of the feeling of hunger and thirst that one would suffer if he was poor. Another reason is to suffer and be patient (during fasting so as to receive rewards, and to act as proofs of the Hereafter’s hardships. In addition to all of this, fasting is a cause of elimination of lust and acts as an advisor for us, and as a proof for the Hereafter to see its hardships. Fasting also makes us realize the extent of hardships suffered by the poor and the indigent in this world and the Hereafter.And God forbade killing since its allowance would corrupt the society, cause its destruction and the corruption of His Plan.And the Honorable the Exalted God forbade doing what might result in parents’ damnation (of us) is that this would involve the disobedience of the Honorable the Exalted God and our parents; an approach to the denial of blessings; cancellation of gratitude and what might lead to the cutting off of and the disruption of family ties. This is because it involves not paying enough respect for parents, recognizing their rights; the cutting off of family ties; the lack of the inclination of parents to see their children, and quitting to upbring them since the parents no longer have any hopes in their well-being.And God forbade adultery due to the corruption it results in, including murders, the disruption of family relations, the abandoning of the proper raising of children, corruption in inheritance issues and other similar forms of corruption.And God forbade oppressively devouring the orphan’s property due to several corrupting reasons. Firstly, when man oppressively devours an orphan’s property he has indeed acted as a partner in murdering the orphan, since an orphan is not self-sufficient and cannot maintain himself. He cannot support himself, and he has no one else to support him and maintain him as his parents would have done. Therefore, if someone devours his property, it is as if he has killed the orphan by leading him into poverty and destitution, even though the Honorable the Exalted God has admonished us against this act. And He has established its punishment in the following Words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘Let those (disposing of an estate) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own, if they had left a helpless family behind: Let them fear God…’”Abi Ja’far (al-Baqir) (a.s.) said, “The Honorable the Exalted God has promised two punishments for devouring the orphan’s property: punishments in this world and punishment in the Hereafter. The reason for the forbiddance of devouring the orphan’s property is to maintain the orphan until he attains his independence and does not need other people’s property. It is also meant to safeguard the survivors of the orphan’s guardian, so that they do not have to suffer the same thing that the orphan suffers by experiencing the punishment that God has promised for this world. Also the orphan will demand his property when he grows up. Then it will result in such hatred, animosity and wrath that it will finally end up in the destruction of them all.And God forbade fleeing from the battle-field since it will weaken the religion, undermine the Prophethood and the just Immaculate Leaders (a.s.), and not help them against their enemies. This will result in punishment as it equates to denying what the Prophet (S) and the Imams (a.s.) invite us to including the confession to His Lordship; expression of social justice; elimination of oppression; destruction of corruption and whatever might happen due to the enemy getting daring with the Muslims, and its consequences such as killing, destroying the Honorable the Exalted God’s religion and any other corruption.And God forbade adopting Arab customs after the migration, since it implies returning from the religion, abandoning the assistance to the Prophets (a.s.) and the Proofs (a.s.), and other corruption that it will lead to. It would also imply the cancellation of all the rights of those who have some rights. This would be similar to living like the Bedouins. Since if one recognizes the religion perfectly then he would not associate with the ignorant ones and would fear them. Should one associate with the ignorant ones, he would not be immune from slowly abandoning his own knowledge and become ignorant - even more ignorant than the ignorant.And God forbade whatever has been slaughtered in a name other than God’s. The Honorable the Exalted God has made it incumbent for His creatures to bear witness to Him, mention His Name over whatever (animals) they slaughter to make them allowable to eat, and as a way to make a distinction between what is done to get nearer to Him and what establishes the worship of the Satans. There lies a confession to His Lordship and Unity in mentioning the Name of the Honorable theExalted, and there lies atheism and seeking to approach other deities in mentioning any other names (while slaughtering). Therefore, remembering God and mentioning His Name over what is slaughtered is what would make a distinction between what God has allowed and what He has forbidden to eat.And God forbade eating wild birds and beasts of prey since they all feed on the dead animals, human corpses and human waste and the like. Then the Honorable, the Exalted God has established some signs in the wild animals and birds, so that those we are allowed to eat can be distinguishable from those that are forbidden to eat. My father (a.s.) said, “Any wild animals that have canine teeth and any birds that have claws are forbidden to eat. Any birds that have gizzards are allowable to eat.”Another sign to distinguish between birds which we are allowed to eat and birds which are forbidden to eat is that my father (a.s.) said, “Eat whichever of the birds that constantly flap their wings while flying, and do not eat any of the birds that sometimes flap their wings but mostly glide.”And God forbade eating rabbits as it has claws like cats and other beasts of prey. Therefore, the same decree about beasts of prey applies to eating rabbits. In addition to this, there is some filthiness in it and bleeding like that of menstruating women since it is a freak (perverted) animal.And the reason behind the forbiddance of usury is that God has admonished against it, because in it there lies the destruction of property. When man buys one Dirham for two Dirhams while the worth of one Dirham is only one Dirham, the second Dirham has become destroyed. Thus usury on transaction is a loss under all circumstances for the buyer and the seller. Thus the Blessed the Sublime God forbade usury due to its effect on destroying property as He has admonished against letting a fool have any control over his own property, since there is the fear that he might destroy it. This holds until he matures intellectually. Thus this is the reason God has forbidden usury, and the purchase of one Dirham in exchange for two Dirhams.And the reason behind the forbiddance of usury after the decree on it became clear is that practicing usury implies the underestimation of what God has forbidden. That is committing a major sin after it has been clarified. The Sublime God has forbidden it. This is nothing but an underestimation of the forbiddance of what is forbidden, and such an underestimation equals becoming an atheist.And the reason behind the forbiddance of usury on loan is that doing good deeds will disappear, and property will be destroyed. The people will be inclined to gain a benefit without exerting any effort. The payment of loans will be abandoned while it is one of the good deeds. In this there is corruption, oppression and the destruction of property.And God forbade eating pork as a pig is ugly. The Honorable the Exalted God has set it as a lesson to take heed of for the people, and as a scare crow and a reason to see what a freak it is for His creatures. It is also because its food is the most contaminated - plus many more reasons.God also forbade eating monkeys as they are freaks like pigs. He has set it as a lesson to take heed of for the people, and as a scare crow and a reason to see what a freak is for His creatures. Also about the monkey’s face, God established it like man to be a proof for man that it is one of the creatures upon which there was God’s Wrath.And God forbade eating whatever is dead due to the existence of things in them which would corrupt the body and would cause calamities (a.s.erious diseases). The Honorable the Exalted God willed to establish the mentioning of His Name to be the cause for the allowance of eating the animals and that this act be what distinguishes between the allowed and the forbidden to eat.And the Honorable the Exalted God forbade eating blood as He forbade eating the dead due to the existence of things in them which would corrupt the body and would cause bile, bad breath, bad body odor, bad temper, getting mean, lack of kindness and mercy so much that one might even kill his own father or friend.And God forbade eating a spleen since there is blood in it. The reason for this is the same as the reason for the forbiddance of eating blood and the dead as both are in the same direction of corruption.And the reason behind the nuptial gift and its obligation for men, and not upon the women to give to the men is that the expenses of the woman are on the man’s shoulders. The woman is selling herself and the man is the buyer. There is no selling without a cost and no buying without a payment, even though women are excused from doing business and trade due to many reasons.And the reason behind the allowance of men to marry up to four women and the forbidding of women to marry more than one man, is that if a man has four wives, his children are associated with him. However, if a woman has two or more husbands, they cannot tell who the child belongs to since all the husbands equally sleep with her. This will result in the disruption of family ties, inheritance and the recognition of the father-children relations.And the reason behind the limit of two wives for a slave is that he is like half of a free man in both divorce and marriage. He does not have possession of himself. He cannot own any property. Even his own expenses are paid by his master. This is so that there be a difference between him and a free man. And the other reason for this is that he be less involved and pay more attention to the affairs of his master.And the reason behind allowing (a man to divorce his wife) a maximum of three times (before a woman must marry someone else before she can be remarried to) is that there is a chance in between each divorce for the man to get attracted to her again, and his anger lessen. This is also to serve as an admonishment and a way of making the women behave and not disobey their husbands. If not so, she will deserve to be separated from her husband since she has done what she should not have done - being disobedient to her husband.And the reason behind the forbiddance of a man from ever again marrying a woman after he has divorced her nine times is to serve as a punishment for him not to take divorce lightly, not to consider the women to be weak, to carefully watch over his affairs and to know that there are no hopes for reunion with her after divorcing her for nine times.And the reason behind the limitation of divorcing those owned by your right hand only two times, is that the divorcing of slave maids is considered to be half of that of divorcing free women. Therefore, God has established a limit of two times as a precaution in order to perfect the decrees. The same rule holds for the waiting period when their husbands die.And the reason behind not accepting the witnessing of women in cases of divorce and seeing the moon, is due to their weakness of sight, and their friendship with other women. That is why their witnessing is not allowedexcept in cases of necessity like the case of taking a midwife as a witness, or cases where men are not allowed to look. This is similar to the case of the People of the Book, when we cannot find anyone else to bear witness as we read in the Honorable the Exalted God’s Book, ‘…two just men of your own (brotherhood)’ from the Muslims ‘or others from outside…’ from the pagans. It is also similar to the witnessing of immature children in cases of murder when there are no other witnesses.And the reason behind the requirement of four witnesses to adultery and only two for other crimes is the severity of the punishment for adultery, since there is the punishment of execution for it. Therefore, He established double witness requirements for it, since it involves the killing of the people, the disruption of the relationship between fathers and children, and causes inheritance problems.And the reason behind the allowance of children’s property for their father without requiring any permission from them, and the forbiddance of the property of the father for the children without his permission is that the children themselves are born of their father. The Honorable the Exalted God said, “…He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will (and Plan).” Also the children get their sustenance from their father, whether they are small or have grown up. They are associated with him and they are called and are known by his name. The Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘Call them by (the names of) their fathers: that is juster in the sight of God…’ Also the Prophet (S) said, “You and your possessions all belong to your father.” However, the mother’s case is not the same. That is she cannot take her children’s possessions without the permission of her children or their father’s permission, since the father is the one who pays for the children’s living expenses, while the mother does not have to pay for their living expenses.And the reason why the claiming side has to provide the reasoning and the claimant has to swear (by the Qur’an) in all cases, except for bloodshed, is that the claimant cannot provide any proof for his case since he does not know anything. Thus, he has to swear that he is innocent. However, in case of bloodshed, the claimant’s side must provide the reasoning and the claiming side must swear to his claim. This is to prevent undue bloodshed of Muslims and also prevents any torture. In addition, there are usually few to swear that someone has committed murder, so it is very hard for the claimant to provide reasoning.And the reason behind swearing (by the Qur’an) - that is fifty men should swear - is to make it harder and to be more cautious about shedding undue blood.And the reason behind chopping off the right hand of a thief is that he engages in the act of robbery using his right hand which is the noblest human part, and is the most useful one. Therefore, God has established chopping it off as a punishment and as a lesson for others to take heed of and not obtain any property in ways other than what is legitimate. Also most thefts are carried out using the right hand. God also abandoned the forceful seizure of property and obtaining it through ways other than the allowed ways, since there is a lot of corruption in that. It is forbidden since corruption is the main cause of destruction, etc.And God forbade robbery because it would have caused corruption in property and killing people were it allowed. It would also lead to killing, fighting and jealousy due to unlawful seizure. Were it allowed, it would lead to the abandonment of business and work, and everyone would be equally entitled to everything.And the reason behind beating the body of an adulterer hard is that he or she has engaged his or her body in adultery and all of his or her body has derived pleasure. Beating the body is its punishment, and as a lesson for them to take heed of and know that this is one of the greatest crimes.And the reason behind the punishment of eighty lashes for malicious accusation (qadhf) or drinking wine is that there lies the denial of relations, killing and breakage of family ties in malicious accusations. One who drinks wine will hallucinate when he gets drunk and will make false accusations. Therefore, he also deserves to be punished for malicious accusations.And the reason behind killing an adulterer or adulteress after the execution of the Divine Punishment three times, is that he or she has underestimated and paid so little attention to the punishment of lashes that he or she considers himself or herself to be free to do this deed. Another reason behind this is that whoever underestimates God and the Divine Punishment is an atheist. Thus it becomes incumbent to kill him or her for becoming an atheist.And the reason behind the forbiddance of men for men (being gay) and women for women (being lesbian) is the nature of women and man’s natural inclination to women. In the case of gay and lesbian relationships between men with men, and women with women there will be a break in the generations, corruption of the natural order and the world’s destruction.And the Honorable the Exalted God allowed eating cow’s meat, sheep’s meat and camel’s meat due to their abundance, and their availability. The reason for the allowance of eating wild cows and others similar animals is that they eat allowable foods which are not harmful for them or men, and not eat abominable or forbidden foods. They are also not created to be ugly.And the reason why God has made it abominable to eat mules and domesticated asses is that the people need them to ride on and for carrying loads. There is a fear that they would become so scarce that they become extinct. It is not due to them being created ugly or eating bad things.And God forbade looking at women’s hair who are in bonds of marriage to their husbands and also other women, since that would sexually arouse a man, and this sexual arousal would lead him into corruption and partaking of what is not proper or allowed. The same thing holds for other things like their hair which they must cover up except for what the Sublime God has allowed in the following verse, ‘Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage, there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer) garments, provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty…’ meaning other than their garments. Then there is no problem with looking at their hair.And the reason behind the female share of inheritance being half of the male share is that when women marry they take something, but when men marry they have to give something. That is why the male share has been set to be more. Another reason behind the male share being double that of a female share of inheritance is that women are maintained by men. When they need something, the men have to provide for their needs. Such a responsibility does not lie on women regarding the protection and maintenance of men. Men cannot take any expenses from their women. Therefore the Sublime God has established a larger sharefor men. These are the Honorable the Exalted God’s words, ‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because God has given the one more (a.s.trength) than the other, and because they support them from their means…’And the reason behind a wife not inheriting from her husband’s land, except for the price of the building on it, is that the land cannot be divided. Nor can the land be moved from its place to another place. A woman is allowed to leave and cut off relationships from the family. She is allowed to change her husband, but no such possibility exists for the father and the children since their ties cannot be broken. Therefore, the inheritance for the relationship which can be broken, moved or exchanged is only from what can be moved, since they are of a similar nature. And the inheritance for the relationship that is stable and cannot be broken is from what is similarly stable and fixed.",

النِّسَاءِ نِصْفَ مَا يُعْطَى الرِّجَالَ مِنَ الْمِيرَاثِ لانَّ الْمَرْأَةَ إِذَا تَزَوَّجَتْ أَخَذَتْ وَالرَّجُلَ يُعْطِي فَلِذَلِكَ وُفِّرَ عَلَى الرِّجَالِ وَعِلَّةٌ أُخْرَى فِي إِعْطَاءِ الذَّكَرِ

    "thaqalaynSanad": "33-1 Muhammad ibn Ali Majilawayh - may God have Mercy upon him - narrated that his uncle Muhammad ibn Abil Qasim quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abi Abdillah al-Kufi, on the authority of Muhammad ibn San’an, and also Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq, Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-San’ani, Ali ibn Abdullah al-Var’raq and Al-Husayn ibn Ibrahim ibn Ahmad ibn Hisham al-Mokattib - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Muhammad ibnAli al-Kufi quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Isma’il, on the authority of Ali ibn Al-Abbas, on the authority of Al-Qasim ibn Al-Rabi’a As-Sah’haf, on the authority of Muhammad ibn San’an, and also Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Abdullah Al-Barqi, Ali ibn Isa - the neighbor to the Kufa Mosque, and Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Musa - may God have Mercy upon them - narrated that Muhammad ibn Ali Majilawayh, quoted on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn San’an that Abal Hassan Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) wrote the following reasons (behind the decrees) in response to Muhammad ibn San’an’s questions",
    "thaqalaynMatn": ":And the reason behind the obligatory ritual ablution (ghusl) for the major ritual impurity is to cleanse and purify man’s self from what has impurified him. And another reason is to purify the rest of the body from impurities as impurities have come out from all over the body. That is why it is obligatory to clean the whole body.And the reason behind the lesser decree about urination and defecation is the frequency of these acts compared to that of the major ritual impurity, the hardships involved, and the fact that there is no will in doing these acts and there is no lust involved in doing them. However, there is lust in major ritual impurity and it is the result of an intentional act.And the reasons behind the ritual ablution on the two major festivals and on Fridays, and other cases is to express a servant’s honoring of his Lord, prepare himself for Him - the Glorious the Magnificent to ask Him to forgive his sins. Another reason is that they are the holidays which are known to be for congregations in remembrance of the Sublime God. Therefore, God has established the ritual ablution on these days as a way to honor these days and to make them superior to other days - days in which many recommendable prayers are said, much servitude is expressed, and it is a way of purification from one Friday to the next.And the reason behind the major ablution for the dead is to cleanse the corpse from the various filth, illnesses and other things that might have fallen upon him, since the dead person is going to meet the angels and associate with the people of the Hereafter.It is highly desirable for him to be clean and pure now that he is going to meet God and the Pure Ones where they will touch him and he will touch them. This is so that the Pure Ones may ask the Honorable the Exalted God to forgive him and they may intercede on his behalf.And another reason behind the major ablution for the dead is that once he dies, the sperm with which he was at first created with will be discharged from his body and he will be in a state of major ritual impurity. Thus others must perform the major ablution for him.And the reason why once you perform the major ritual ablution for the dead or touch someone’s corpse you must perform the major ritual ablution yourself is to be cleansed of the filth from the corpse that might have touched your body. That is because once someone dies and his soul departs from the body, most of the impurities remain in his body. Therefore, one must do so to get cleaned and purified therefrom. And the reason behind making minor ablutions (wudu) - in which it is prescribed to wash the face, the two arms, rubbing the head, and rubbing the upper side of the feet - is that man wants to stand in front of the Honorable the Exalted God, facing Him and visiting the Honorable Recorders (Kiram Katibin) with all his apparent body parts. Then washing the face is for prostration and humbleness, washing the two arms is for preparing them to be held up towards the heavens, implore and fear God with them and use them to sincerely turn towards the worship of God. The rubbing of the head and the feet is because they are apparent in all positions of the prayer and in them there is not as much humbleness and sincerity of worship as there is in the face and the two hands.And the reason behind the alms-tax is to aid the poor and protect the properties of the rich, as the Blessed the Sublime God has ordained that the healthy assist those afflicted with calamities. As the Sublime God has said, ‘Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves…’ The way you are tried by your possessions is by paying the alms-tax, and the way you are tried by your personal selves is by getting yourselves prepared to be patient during calamities. In paying the alms-tax there is a fulfillment of gratitude for the blessings granted to us by the Honorable the Exalted God, an eagerness to have more of them, kindness and mercy for the weak, and kindness with the poor. And also there is an increased inclination towards sympathizing with the poor; assisting the poor and helping them regarding their religious affairs and a lesson for the rich to take heed to seeing their poorness in the Hereafter; and encouragement to thank the Blessed the Sublime God for what He has bestowed upon us and hasmade us needless of. And also there is an encouragement to pray, cry, and fear that we may become poor like them one day. And also there is an encouragement in performing many deeds similar to paying the alms-tax such as charity, visiting the relatives and being kind to others.And the reason behind the Hajj pilgrimage is that it is a form of getting near to God, asking Him for extensive rewards, departing from all the sins that one has committed, to be repentant for all that he has done in the past, and to start what he will do in the future. The pilgrimage is also for experiencing the expenditures of his wealth and exert himself; avoiding lust and pleasure so as to seek nearness to the Honorable the Exalted God. The pilgrimage is also for feeling humility and courtesy; suffering from the difficulties of the trip in the various conditions of heat, cold, security and fear for a long span of time. The benefits in the Hajj pilgrimage for the people include asking the Honorable the Exalted God for the fulfillment of our needs; abandoning relentlessness of the heart; abandoning the daring of the self; abandoning forgetfulness to remember God; abandoning lack of hope and engaging in action; renewal of the rights; preventing the self from getting corrupt; benefiting the people in the East or the West of the Earth - whether they live in the deserts or at sea; whether they partake in the Hajj pilgrimage or not; whether they import things; whether they do business with men (a.s.ell or buy); and whether they are dealers or needy men. It also includes the fulfillment of the needs of the people who live in that vicinity where the Hajj pilgrims gather together as God has said, ‘That they may witness the benefits (provided) for them.’And the reason behind the obligation of going on the Hajj pilgrimage once (in the lifetime) is that the Honorable the Exalted God has considered the least powerful of the people in establishing the obligatory deeds (they only need to go once). One of these obligations is the Hajj pilgrimage which is obligatory once. God has encouraged the powerful people to go as often as they can.And the reason behind establishing the House (of God) in the middle of the Earth is that it is the place where land at first came out of water. All the winds that blow in the world start from there at the point beneath the ‘al-Rokn ash-Shami. The House of God was the first mausoleum established on the Earth. Therefore, it is the center and the religiouspilgrimage obligation for all the people whether they are from the East or the West. Mecca was so named because the people used to whistle there, and they called whoever intended to go there as he whistled. This is clear from the Words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘Their prayer at the House (of God) is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands…’ Here the word ‘Mecca used in the verse in Arabic means whistling and the word ‘Tasdiyah used in the verse in Arabic means clapping.And the reason behind the circumambulation around the House (of God) is that the Blessed the Sublime God told the angels, ‘I will create a vicegerent on earth.’ They said, ‘Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?…’ They gave this reply to the Sublime God, but then they became sorry, took refuge in the Throne and repented. The Honorable the Exalted God desired that other servants worship in a similar fashion just like the angels. Therefore, He founded a House parallel to the Throne in the Fourth Heaven called ‘Az-Zorah. Then He founded another House in the Heavens of this world parallel to ‘Az-Zorah called ‘Al-Bayt al-Ma’mur. Then He founded this House parallel to ‘Al-Bayt al-Ma’mur. Then He ordered Adam (a.s.) to circumambulate around it. Then the Honorable the Exalted God forgave him and this became a practice for his progeny all the way up until the Resurrection Day.And the reason behind kissing or touching the Black Stone is that when the Blessed the Sublime God made a covenant with the children of Adam, the Black Stone swallowed it and thus made the people obliged to honor this covenant. That is near the Black Stone they must say, ‘This is what I was entrusted with and I fulfilled it. This is my covenant and I honored it. Therefore, bear witness that I honored my covenant.’ The same meaning lies in Salman’s words, ‘On the Resurrection Day the Black Stone will appear like Mount Abi Qays with a tongue. It will testify on behalf of whoever has visited it.’And the reason behind naming Mina (meaning beg) is that Gabriel descended to Abraham and said, ‘Beg your Lord for something.’ Then Abraham asked that God establish the offering of a sheep instead of offering his son Ishmael, and God order that the sheep be slaughtered for Him. Then this request was granted.And the reason behind fasting is the realization of the feeling of hunger and thirst that one would suffer if he was poor. Another reason is to suffer and be patient (during fasting so as to receive rewards, and to act as proofs of the Hereafter’s hardships. In addition to all of this, fasting is a cause of elimination of lust and acts as an advisor for us, and as a proof for the Hereafter to see its hardships. Fasting also makes us realize the extent of hardships suffered by the poor and the indigent in this world and the Hereafter.And God forbade killing since its allowance would corrupt the society, cause its destruction and the corruption of His Plan.And the Honorable the Exalted God forbade doing what might result in parents’ damnation (of us) is that this would involve the disobedience of the Honorable the Exalted God and our parents; an approach to the denial of blessings; cancellation of gratitude and what might lead to the cutting off of and the disruption of family ties. This is because it involves not paying enough respect for parents, recognizing their rights; the cutting off of family ties; the lack of the inclination of parents to see their children, and quitting to upbring them since the parents no longer have any hopes in their well-being.And God forbade adultery due to the corruption it results in, including murders, the disruption of family relations, the abandoning of the proper raising of children, corruption in inheritance issues and other similar forms of corruption.And God forbade oppressively devouring the orphan’s property due to several corrupting reasons. Firstly, when man oppressively devours an orphan’s property he has indeed acted as a partner in murdering the orphan, since an orphan is not self-sufficient and cannot maintain himself. He cannot support himself, and he has no one else to support him and maintain him as his parents would have done. Therefore, if someone devours his property, it is as if he has killed the orphan by leading him into poverty and destitution, even though the Honorable the Exalted God has admonished us against this act. And He has established its punishment in the following Words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘Let those (disposing of an estate) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own, if they had left a helpless family behind: Let them fear God…’”Abi Ja’far (al-Baqir) (a.s.) said, “The Honorable the Exalted God has promised two punishments for devouring the orphan’s property: punishments in this world and punishment in the Hereafter. The reason for the forbiddance of devouring the orphan’s property is to maintain the orphan until he attains his independence and does not need other people’s property. It is also meant to safeguard the survivors of the orphan’s guardian, so that they do not have to suffer the same thing that the orphan suffers by experiencing the punishment that God has promised for this world. Also the orphan will demand his property when he grows up. Then it will result in such hatred, animosity and wrath that it will finally end up in the destruction of them all.And God forbade fleeing from the battle-field since it will weaken the religion, undermine the Prophethood and the just Immaculate Leaders (a.s.), and not help them against their enemies. This will result in punishment as it equates to denying what the Prophet (S) and the Imams (a.s.) invite us to including the confession to His Lordship; expression of social justice; elimination of oppression; destruction of corruption and whatever might happen due to the enemy getting daring with the Muslims, and its consequences such as killing, destroying the Honorable the Exalted God’s religion and any other corruption.And God forbade adopting Arab customs after the migration, since it implies returning from the religion, abandoning the assistance to the Prophets (a.s.) and the Proofs (a.s.), and other corruption that it will lead to. It would also imply the cancellation of all the rights of those who have some rights. This would be similar to living like the Bedouins. Since if one recognizes the religion perfectly then he would not associate with the ignorant ones and would fear them. Should one associate with the ignorant ones, he would not be immune from slowly abandoning his own knowledge and become ignorant - even more ignorant than the ignorant.And God forbade whatever has been slaughtered in a name other than God’s. The Honorable the Exalted God has made it incumbent for His creatures to bear witness to Him, mention His Name over whatever (animals) they slaughter to make them allowable to eat, and as a way to make a distinction between what is done to get nearer to Him and what establishes the worship of the Satans. There lies a confession to His Lordship and Unity in mentioning the Name of the Honorable theExalted, and there lies atheism and seeking to approach other deities in mentioning any other names (while slaughtering). Therefore, remembering God and mentioning His Name over what is slaughtered is what would make a distinction between what God has allowed and what He has forbidden to eat.And God forbade eating wild birds and beasts of prey since they all feed on the dead animals, human corpses and human waste and the like. Then the Honorable, the Exalted God has established some signs in the wild animals and birds, so that those we are allowed to eat can be distinguishable from those that are forbidden to eat. My father (a.s.) said, “Any wild animals that have canine teeth and any birds that have claws are forbidden to eat. Any birds that have gizzards are allowable to eat.”Another sign to distinguish between birds which we are allowed to eat and birds which are forbidden to eat is that my father (a.s.) said, “Eat whichever of the birds that constantly flap their wings while flying, and do not eat any of the birds that sometimes flap their wings but mostly glide.”And God forbade eating rabbits as it has claws like cats and other beasts of prey. Therefore, the same decree about beasts of prey applies to eating rabbits. In addition to this, there is some filthiness in it and bleeding like that of menstruating women since it is a freak (perverted) animal.And the reason behind the forbiddance of usury is that God has admonished against it, because in it there lies the destruction of property. When man buys one Dirham for two Dirhams while the worth of one Dirham is only one Dirham, the second Dirham has become destroyed. Thus usury on transaction is a loss under all circumstances for the buyer and the seller. Thus the Blessed the Sublime God forbade usury due to its effect on destroying property as He has admonished against letting a fool have any control over his own property, since there is the fear that he might destroy it. This holds until he matures intellectually. Thus this is the reason God has forbidden usury, and the purchase of one Dirham in exchange for two Dirhams.And the reason behind the forbiddance of usury after the decree on it became clear is that practicing usury implies the underestimation of what God has forbidden. That is committing a major sin after it has been clarified. The Sublime God has forbidden it. This is nothing but an underestimation of the forbiddance of what is forbidden, and such an underestimation equals becoming an atheist.And the reason behind the forbiddance of usury on loan is that doing good deeds will disappear, and property will be destroyed. The people will be inclined to gain a benefit without exerting any effort. The payment of loans will be abandoned while it is one of the good deeds. In this there is corruption, oppression and the destruction of property.And God forbade eating pork as a pig is ugly. The Honorable the Exalted God has set it as a lesson to take heed of for the people, and as a scare crow and a reason to see what a freak it is for His creatures. It is also because its food is the most contaminated - plus many more reasons.God also forbade eating monkeys as they are freaks like pigs. He has set it as a lesson to take heed of for the people, and as a scare crow and a reason to see what a freak is for His creatures. Also about the monkey’s face, God established it like man to be a proof for man that it is one of the creatures upon which there was God’s Wrath.And God forbade eating whatever is dead due to the existence of things in them which would corrupt the body and would cause calamities (a.s.erious diseases). The Honorable the Exalted God willed to establish the mentioning of His Name to be the cause for the allowance of eating the animals and that this act be what distinguishes between the allowed and the forbidden to eat.And the Honorable the Exalted God forbade eating blood as He forbade eating the dead due to the existence of things in them which would corrupt the body and would cause bile, bad breath, bad body odor, bad temper, getting mean, lack of kindness and mercy so much that one might even kill his own father or friend.And God forbade eating a spleen since there is blood in it. The reason for this is the same as the reason for the forbiddance of eating blood and the dead as both are in the same direction of corruption.And the reason behind the nuptial gift and its obligation for men, and not upon the women to give to the men is that the expenses of the woman are on the man’s shoulders. The woman is selling herself and the man is the buyer. There is no selling without a cost and no buying without a payment, even though women are excused from doing business and trade due to many reasons.And the reason behind the allowance of men to marry up to four women and the forbidding of women to marry more than one man, is that if a man has four wives, his children are associated with him. However, if a woman has two or more husbands, they cannot tell who the child belongs to since all the husbands equally sleep with her. This will result in the disruption of family ties, inheritance and the recognition of the father-children relations.And the reason behind the limit of two wives for a slave is that he is like half of a free man in both divorce and marriage. He does not have possession of himself. He cannot own any property. Even his own expenses are paid by his master. This is so that there be a difference between him and a free man. And the other reason for this is that he be less involved and pay more attention to the affairs of his master.And the reason behind allowing (a man to divorce his wife) a maximum of three times (before a woman must marry someone else before she can be remarried to) is that there is a chance in between each divorce for the man to get attracted to her again, and his anger lessen. This is also to serve as an admonishment and a way of making the women behave and not disobey their husbands. If not so, she will deserve to be separated from her husband since she has done what she should not have done - being disobedient to her husband.And the reason behind the forbiddance of a man from ever again marrying a woman after he has divorced her nine times is to serve as a punishment for him not to take divorce lightly, not to consider the women to be weak, to carefully watch over his affairs and to know that there are no hopes for reunion with her after divorcing her for nine times.And the reason behind the limitation of divorcing those owned by your right hand only two times, is that the divorcing of slave maids is considered to be half of that of divorcing free women. Therefore, God has established a limit of two times as a precaution in order to perfect the decrees. The same rule holds for the waiting period when their husbands die.And the reason behind not accepting the witnessing of women in cases of divorce and seeing the moon, is due to their weakness of sight, and their friendship with other women. That is why their witnessing is not allowedexcept in cases of necessity like the case of taking a midwife as a witness, or cases where men are not allowed to look. This is similar to the case of the People of the Book, when we cannot find anyone else to bear witness as we read in the Honorable the Exalted God’s Book, ‘…two just men of your own (brotherhood)’ from the Muslims ‘or others from outside…’ from the pagans. It is also similar to the witnessing of immature children in cases of murder when there are no other witnesses.And the reason behind the requirement of four witnesses to adultery and only two for other crimes is the severity of the punishment for adultery, since there is the punishment of execution for it. Therefore, He established double witness requirements for it, since it involves the killing of the people, the disruption of the relationship between fathers and children, and causes inheritance problems.And the reason behind the allowance of children’s property for their father without requiring any permission from them, and the forbiddance of the property of the father for the children without his permission is that the children themselves are born of their father. The Honorable the Exalted God said, “…He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will (and Plan).” Also the children get their sustenance from their father, whether they are small or have grown up. They are associated with him and they are called and are known by his name. The Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘Call them by (the names of) their fathers: that is juster in the sight of God…’ Also the Prophet (S) said, “You and your possessions all belong to your father.” However, the mother’s case is not the same. That is she cannot take her children’s possessions without the permission of her children or their father’s permission, since the father is the one who pays for the children’s living expenses, while the mother does not have to pay for their living expenses.And the reason why the claiming side has to provide the reasoning and the claimant has to swear (by the Qur’an) in all cases, except for bloodshed, is that the claimant cannot provide any proof for his case since he does not know anything. Thus, he has to swear that he is innocent. However, in case of bloodshed, the claimant’s side must provide the reasoning and the claiming side must swear to his claim. This is to prevent undue bloodshed of Muslims and also prevents any torture. In addition, there are usually few to swear that someone has committed murder, so it is very hard for the claimant to provide reasoning.And the reason behind swearing (by the Qur’an) - that is fifty men should swear - is to make it harder and to be more cautious about shedding undue blood.And the reason behind chopping off the right hand of a thief is that he engages in the act of robbery using his right hand which is the noblest human part, and is the most useful one. Therefore, God has established chopping it off as a punishment and as a lesson for others to take heed of and not obtain any property in ways other than what is legitimate. Also most thefts are carried out using the right hand. God also abandoned the forceful seizure of property and obtaining it through ways other than the allowed ways, since there is a lot of corruption in that. It is forbidden since corruption is the main cause of destruction, etc.And God forbade robbery because it would have caused corruption in property and killing people were it allowed. It would also lead to killing, fighting and jealousy due to unlawful seizure. Were it allowed, it would lead to the abandonment of business and work, and everyone would be equally entitled to everything.And the reason behind beating the body of an adulterer hard is that he or she has engaged his or her body in adultery and all of his or her body has derived pleasure. Beating the body is its punishment, and as a lesson for them to take heed of and know that this is one of the greatest crimes.And the reason behind the punishment of eighty lashes for malicious accusation (qadhf) or drinking wine is that there lies the denial of relations, killing and breakage of family ties in malicious accusations. One who drinks wine will hallucinate when he gets drunk and will make false accusations. Therefore, he also deserves to be punished for malicious accusations.And the reason behind killing an adulterer or adulteress after the execution of the Divine Punishment three times, is that he or she has underestimated and paid so little attention to the punishment of lashes that he or she considers himself or herself to be free to do this deed. Another reason behind this is that whoever underestimates God and the Divine Punishment is an atheist. Thus it becomes incumbent to kill him or her for becoming an atheist.And the reason behind the forbiddance of men for men (being gay) and women for women (being lesbian) is the nature of women and man’s natural inclination to women. In the case of gay and lesbian relationships between men with men, and women with women there will be a break in the generations, corruption of the natural order and the world’s destruction.And the Honorable the Exalted God allowed eating cow’s meat, sheep’s meat and camel’s meat due to their abundance, and their availability. The reason for the allowance of eating wild cows and others similar animals is that they eat allowable foods which are not harmful for them or men, and not eat abominable or forbidden foods. They are also not created to be ugly.And the reason why God has made it abominable to eat mules and domesticated asses is that the people need them to ride on and for carrying loads. There is a fear that they would become so scarce that they become extinct. It is not due to them being created ugly or eating bad things.And God forbade looking at women’s hair who are in bonds of marriage to their husbands and also other women, since that would sexually arouse a man, and this sexual arousal would lead him into corruption and partaking of what is not proper or allowed. The same thing holds for other things like their hair which they must cover up except for what the Sublime God has allowed in the following verse, ‘Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage, there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer) garments, provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty…’ meaning other than their garments. Then there is no problem with looking at their hair.And the reason behind the female share of inheritance being half of the male share is that when women marry they take something, but when men marry they have to give something. That is why the male share has been set to be more. Another reason behind the male share being double that of a female share of inheritance is that women are maintained by men. When they need something, the men have to provide for their needs. Such a responsibility does not lie on women regarding the protection and maintenance of men. Men cannot take any expenses from their women. Therefore the Sublime God has established a larger sharefor men. These are the Honorable the Exalted God’s words, ‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because God has given the one more (a.s.trength) than the other, and because they support them from their means…’And the reason behind a wife not inheriting from her husband’s land, except for the price of the building on it, is that the land cannot be divided. Nor can the land be moved from its place to another place. A woman is allowed to leave and cut off relationships from the family. She is allowed to change her husband, but no such possibility exists for the father and the children since their ties cannot be broken. Therefore, the inheritance for the relationship which can be broken, moved or exchanged is only from what can be moved, since they are of a similar nature. And the inheritance for the relationship that is stable and cannot be broken is from what is similarly stable and fixed.",

    "englishText": "34-1 In the (Arabic) month of Sha’ban of the year 352 A.H. (962 A.D.) Abdul Wahid Muhammad ibn Ubdoos al-Neishaboori al-At’tar - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Abul Hassan Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Qutayba al-Neishaboori quoted the following on the authority of Abu Muhammad Fadhl ibn Shathan al-Neishaboori. Moreover, al-Hakim Abu Muhammad Ja’far ibn Nu’aym ibn Shathan - may God have Mercy upon him - quoted on the authority of his uncle Abi Abdullah Muhammad ibn Shathan, on the authority of Fadhl ibn Shathan:“ If someone asks, ‘Let me know if it is permissible for the Wise God to oblige His servants to do something without any reason or meaning.’He is told, ‘No. This is not permissible since He is Wise and He does not do frivolous or ignorant things. \u003Cbr\u003E ’And if he asks, ‘Let me know why God has made the people obliged (to do certain things)?’It is said, ‘For many reasons.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Let me know if the obligations are known and existing, or they are unknown and non-existent?’It is said, ‘Yes. They are known and are existent for their people.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Do you know them or not?’It is said, ‘There are some which I know of, and there are others which I do not know.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘What is the first obligation?’It is said, ‘To testify to God, His Messenger and His Proof, and whatever has come from the Honorable the Exalted God.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the creatures ordered to testify to God, His Messenger and His Proof, and whatever has come from the Honorable the Exalted God.’It is said, ‘For many reasons: One of them is that whoever does not testify to the Honorable the Exalted God would not avoid His disobedience, would not avoid committing major sins, and would not fear anyone regarding what his lust demands and enjoy corruption and oppression. Should the people commit these actions and should everyone act out of lust and selfish desires without fearing anyone, the result would be corruption for all the people. Some of them will attack others, rape women, steal goods, consider it fine to shed undue blood and commit adultery, and unrightfully kill others who have not committed any crimes. This would destroy the life of this world and corrupt the future generations. One of the reasons for this is that the Honorable the Exalted God is All-Wise and no one would be wise or described to be wise unless he admonishes against corruption and reprimands oppression. Such acts of admonishing against corruption and ordering to do what is right are not possible except after testifying to the Honorable the Exalted God and the recognition of the One who enjoins good and the One who admonishes. Were the people left without testifying to the Honorable the Exalted God and His recognition, enjoining to do right and admonishing against corruption, would not get established since there was no known enjoiner to do the right and admonished against corruption. We also know that there are some people who commit corruption in hiding away from public sight. Were it not for the sake of testifying to God and fearing Him in private, everyone would engage in lustful deeds in private without any fear of anyone. Knowing that no one is aware of what he does, one would go to the extreme in committing the forbidden deeds and major sins, since what he does is hidden from the people. This would lead to the destruction of all the people. Thus the stability and continuation of the people (generations) would not have been possible unless the people were asked to testify to the existence of the All-Knowing; the All-Aware (God) who knows what is hidden and what is deeply hidden; who enjoins to do right and forbids corruption and from whom nothing could remain hidden so as to prevent whatever form of corruption which they might engage in privately.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it incumbent upon the people to recognize the Messengers (a.s.), testify to them, and swear to obey them?’It is said, ‘Because man has not been equipped with the necessary powers in his own nature to be able to realize all that is best for him to do. Moreover, the Creator is High Exalted above that which is seen. The people are also weak and unable to recognize Him on the surface. Then a Messenger must be sent to be in between Him and them - an Immaculate one who delivers His Orders and Admonishments to them, to inform them about what would benefit them and what would fend off their losses. If it was not incumbent upon the people to get to recognize and obey Him, there would be no benefit in sending them any Messengers, and doing that would not have fulfilled any of their needs. It would even be that dispatching Messengers to them would be of no use to them. This is not amongst the characteristics of an All-Wise One who has created everything with a perfect order.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish some to be in charge of affairs and ordered us to obey them?’It is said, ‘For many reasons. One of them is for the people to know that there are some known limits and they are ordered not to transgress beyond these limits so that they will not become corrupt. This would not be implemented unless a trustworthy man is appointed to prevent them from transgressing and getting involved in what has been prohibited for them. Were this not the case, no one would abandon what fulfilled his lustful desires and brought him some gains - even if it corrupted others. Therefore, God appointed someone to be in charge of their (the people’s) affairs to carry out the Divine Decrees and Divine Chastisements amongst them and prevent them from getting corrupt.Another reason is that we know of no groups or nations who have survived living without someone in charge of them or leading them regarding their religious and worldly affairs. Thus it would not be deemed proper according to the wisdom of the All-Wise (God) to leave the people without one in charge of their affairs, while He knows that there is no other choice for them and they would not sustain without one. The people would fight their enemies, distribute national income, establish congregations and congregational prayers, and protect the oppressed from the oppressors under his (the leader’s) Divine Leadership.Another reason is that if He does not establish a trustworthy custodian for them, their nation would be totally destroyed, their religion would be lost, their traditions and decrees would change: innovators would add things to them and atheists would subtract things from them and make them dubious for the Muslims. We have found the oppressed and the needy to be imperfect and narrow-minded. Moreover, they have various levels of intellectual abilities, desires and varying opinions. Thus as we said before, they would all get corrupted if there was no one appointed to be in charge of their affairs to safeguard what the Messenger (a.s.) has brought to them from Him. Then the Divine Decrees, the traditions, the foundations of the religion and faith would all change. This would ultimately result in the corruption of all the people.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it not permissible for the existence of two or more Divine Leaders at the same time on the Earth?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that one leader would not have any conflicting actions or plans. However, if there were two, then their actions and plans would not conform with each other and they would not have the same opinion as so far we have not seen any two people who are in charge of an affair and not have different views on things, and different demands. Therefore, if there were two Divine Leaders with different wills, intentions and plans and it was obligatory to follow both of them, and the obedience of one was not superior to the obedience of the other, then there would certainly be differences among the people, and fighting and corruption would ensue. This would be because no one could obey one without disobeying the other. Then all the people of the Earth would be disobedient, and they would not have a path that would lead them towards obedience and faith. This problem would be rooted in their Creator who Himself has opened up the door of discord, fighting and corruption for them by ordering them to obey two leaders with opposite views.The other reason is that if there were two Divine Leaders, the people who are enemies of each other would each go to one side as they pleased and no one’s ruling over the other would be effective. This is so since they do not accept his ruling, and do not consider themselves obliged to obey him. They would not consider anyone more deserving than the other to rule. Thus all the Rights, Decrees and Divine Punishments would be nullified.Another reason is that neither of these two Proofs (of God or Leaders) would be superior to the other in speaking out, issuing decrees, enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong. And in these conditions they would both have to speak out. Neither one of them would deserve to surpass the other one in any issue, since they both have an equal rank in their religious leadership position. If one of them should remain silent, the other one must also remain silent. And if they both remain silent, again Rights, Decrees and Divine Punishments would be nullified. Then it would be as if the people do not have any Divine Leaders at all.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it not permissible for the Divine Leader to be from a family different from that of the Messenger of God?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that there should be a sign to clearly indicate the Divine Leader and distinguish him from others, since it is obligatory to obey him. That sign is his well-known ties of kinship (with the Prophet Muhammad (S)) and his clear appointment so that the people can distinguish him from others, and be clearly guided towards him.Another reason is that should the Divine Leader be one who is from a family different from that of the Messenger of God, then one who is not from the family of the Prophet (S) would become nobler than those from the family of the Prophet (S). In this way, the offspring of the Prophet (S) would become subject to the offspring of the Prophet’s (a.s.) enemies such as Abi Jahl or Ibn Abi Ma’eet: since they believed that if they have faith the Divine Leadership could be transferred from the Prophet’s (a.s.) offspring to the offspring of the enemies. Then this would result in the offspring of the Prophet (S) to be the subject and obedient ones, while the offspring of the enemies of God and His Messenger (a.s.) be the ones to be followed and obeyed. However, the Messenger (a.s.) is much nobler than others to be in charge, and he (a.s.) is the one who most deserves to be obeyed.Another reason is that once the people testify to the Prophethood of His Messenger (a.s.) and obey him, no one would hesitate to follow his offspring and obey them. This would not be hard for anyone. However, if the Divine Leader be one who is not from the Household of the Messenger of God (a.s.), everyone would consider himself to be more deserving for this position than others. Thus they would become so haughty that they would not obey him since they consider him to be less deserving of leadership than they themselves. Then this would cause corruption, discord and disunion amongst them.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it incumbent on the people to bear witness and know that there is One and Only One God?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that they would imagine there were two or more planners of the affairs (of the universe), if it was not incumbent upon them to do so. If this was allowed, then they could not recognize their true Creator from the others since each person could not tell which of the two or more is the Creator and might obey one who is not really his Creator. No one could tell which one has created him, which one he must obey and whose admonishments he must listen to since he could not recognize the true One who issues orders and admonishes us against others.Another reason is that were it possible for there to be two gods, then neither one was more deserving than the other one to be worshipped and obeyed. The permission to obey each one of them implied the permission to obey the partner. This would then imply the permission not to obey God. The permission not to obey God would imply disbelief in God; all His Books and Messengers; proof of all that is wrong; abandoning all that is right; allowing all that is forbidden; forbidding all that is allowed; partaking in all sins; abandoning all forms of obedience; authorizing all forms of corruption and abolishing all rights.’Another reason is that were it possible for more than one god to be, then this would allow Satan to declare himself to be the other god to oppose the Sublime God in all His Decrees and invite the people towards himself. This would result in greater disbelief and more serious dissimulation. \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why is it incumbent on the people to bear witness to God and that there is nothing like Him?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that they do not go after others and worship and obey none other than Him, so that the orders of their Lord and Creator and Sustainer are not dubious for them.Another reason is that should they not recognize that there is nothing like unto Him they might not realize the truth and establish these idols as their lord and creator - the idols which their forefathers have taken as their lords such as the sun, the moon, and the fire. Was it permissible that this issue be doubtful for them it would lead into corruption, abandoning all forms of obedience, committing all forms of sins according to the degree to which they were informed about its being allowed or admonished against by their lord.Another reason is that if it was not incumbent upon the people to realize that there is nothing like unto Him, that would allow them to think that He is subject to whatever the creatures are subject to - things such as disability, ignorance, change, destruction, termination, falsehood and oppression. There would be no hopes for the survival of, trust in the justness of, acceptability of the words, the decrees, the admonishments, the promises, the threats, the rewards or the chastisements of whoever has such traits. This would result in the corruption of the people and the abolition of His Lordship.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has the Sublime God ordered the servants and admonished them?’It is said, ‘Since their survival and the improvements in their affairs depends upon His ordering, admonishing, preventing them from corruption and unlawful seizure (of other people’s property.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has He ordered the people to worship?’It is said, ‘So that they do not forget His remembrance, do not abandon His discipline, do not take His Orders and Admonishments lightly, since their peace and survival depends upon this. Were they left without any orders to worship and some time passed by, then their hearts would harden.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has He ordered the people to pray?’It is said, ‘Since praying is testifying to His Lordship. This is good for everyone since it implies abandoning other worshipped ones; humbly standing in front of the Omnipotent; subordination; subservience; obedience; confessing (to God’s Mastery); seeking the forgiveness of past sins. Praying also implies placing one’s face on the ground everyday so that one always remembers God; being submissive; really humble; eagerly wanting to improve one’s religious and worldly affairs; and despising corruption. Praying is done every day and night so that the servant does not forget his Planner and Creator; does not become ungrateful and rebellious; is always obedient to his Creator; stands in front of his Lord; is prevented from committing sins; and protects and guards himself against various forms of corruption.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that we have been ordered to perform the minor ritual ablution (wudu) and then start to worship?’It is said, ‘So that the servant is clean when he stands in front of the Omnipotent, and obeys His Orders when he is supplicating to Him. It is also done to be cleansed of any impurities and contaminations. Performing one’s ablutions will also eliminate indolence and slumber, and strengthen the heart in front of the Omnipotent.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that it is incumbent upon one to wash the face, hands, head and feet?It is said, ‘That is because when the servant stands in front of the Omnipotent, the parts of the body that must be washed by means of performance one’s ablutions are visible. That is because one expresses his humbleness and prostrates using his face; he implores God by using his hands, and fears God by means of them and uses them to sincerely turn towards the worship of God. One uses his head first when he bows down and prostrates. And with his feet he stands up and sits down.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that it has become incumbent upon one to wash the face and the hands, and only wipe the head and the feet (with one’s moist hand), but it has not become incumbent upon one to wash them all or wipe them all?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that the greatest form of worship is bowing down and prostrating. Bowing down and prostrating are both performed using the face and the hands, but not the head and the feet. Another reason is that people are not always ready to wash their heads and feet. This would be difficult for them to do in cold weather, when they are on a journey, when they are ill, and at certain times of the night and day. However, it is easier to wash the face and the hands than wipe the head and the feet. That is why the difficulty of the obligatory deeds are set up for the weakest of the healthy people. All the people - whether they are strong or weak - are obliged to perform them. Another reason is that the head and the feet are not always visible like the face and the hands as they are the places for turbans, shoes and other similar headwear or footwear items.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that only what leaves from the two sides and sleeping, but not anything else, voids the minor ritual ablution?’It is said, ‘The two sides are the pathways to release the human wastes. There are no other paths for man to let out waste from his body. So, they are ordered to clean themselves when they are exposed to such impurity.And regarding sleeping, when one falls asleep, he gets relaxed and his organs open up. Most of what leaves his body is gas. For that reason, it becomes incumbent upon him to perform the minor ritual ablution.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that we have not been ordered to perform the major ritual ablution to cleanse us from these impurities as we have been in case of major ritual impurity?’It is said, ‘That is because the minor ritual impurities are continuous, and it is not possible for the people to always perform major ritual ablutions for them. God does not oblige anyone to do what is beyond his ability. However, the major ritual impurity is not continuous. It is due to the overcoming of lust. One can decide to procrastinate lust or expedite it for three days, less or more. However, the same does not hold for going to the W.C.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that we have been ordered to perform the major ritual ablution for major ritual impurity and not ordered to perform the major ritual ablution for defecation while it is filthier than the major ritual impurity?’It is said, ‘Since the major ritual impurity leaves all of man’s self, that is it is the things that leave all the body, while in defecation it is not what is excreted out of all of the body. It is the food that enters from one side and the wastes which leave from the other side.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Let me know why we have been ordered to recite the ‘Azan?’It is said, ‘For many reasons. One of them is for it to serve as a reminder for those who forget, as an admonishment for those who neglect, as a time-marker for those who do not know the time so that they get busy doing the prayer. It is also to serve as a caller of the people to worship the Creator, to encourage them to bear witness to the Unity in it, to manifest the faith and propagate Islam. The ‘Azan is a call to those who have forgotten. The reason the caller of the ‘Azan (athan) is called ‘mo’athin is that he calls to the prayer.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why does it start with saying the ‘Takbir (‘God is the Greatest!’) before saying the ‘Tahlil (‘There is no god but God.’)It is said, ‘It is because He willed that His Name be mentioned first and His Name God the Sublime is said first in saying ‘God is the Greatest!’ However, the Name of God is the last word in ‘There is no god but God!’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is every phrase in the ‘Azan’ repeated twice?It is said, ‘They are repeated so that they are emphasized for those who hear them. If they neglect the first one, they can notice it the second time. The other reason is that since the prayer is said in two units, the phrases in the ‘Azan are also repeated.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why is the ‘Takbir repeated four times at the beginning of the ‘Azan?’It is said, ‘Since the ‘Azan begins when no one is paying any attention and there is nothing said before it to attract the attention of the listeners, it is done in order to draw the attention of the listeners to what will follow in the ‘Azan.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there the two testimonies after the ‘Takbir.’It is said, ‘Since the principal part of faith is Unity and testifying to the Unity of the Honorable the Exalted God. The second part of faith is testifying to the Prophethood of His Messenger. Obeying the two of them and recognizing the two of them equals faith. The principal part of faith is testifying. Thus the two testimonies are in the ‘Azan as there are two testimonies required in other legal affairs. Therefore, once one testifies to the Unity of the Sublime God and testifies to the Prophethood of the Prophet, he has indeed testified to all aspects of faith since the main part of faith is testifying to God and His Messenger.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there an invitation to praying after the two testimonies?’It is said, ‘Since basically the ‘Azan is said where it is meant to pray and is a call to prayer. Thus the call to prayer is in the middle of the ‘Azan with four phrases before it including two ‘Takbir’s plus two testimonies. Then four phrases come after it including two calls to prosperity urging us to devotion and praying followed by two calls encouraging us to do good deeds. Then the caller says two ‘Takbir’s and two ‘Tahlil’s completes the four last phrases as he did the first four phrases. He then finishes off by mentioning God just as he started out by mentioning the name of the Sublime God.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish saying ‘There is no god but God!’ at the end and did not establish saying ‘God is the Greatest!’ at the end as He did in the beginning of it?’It is said, ‘Because in saying There is no god but God! God’s Name comes last, and the Sublime God likes that speech ends in His Name as it opens in His Name.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there not ‘Tasbih (a.s.aying subhanallah; glory be to God) or ‘Tahmid (a.s.aying alhamdu lillah; Praise be to God) instead of ‘Tahlil (There is no god but God) which both also end in the Name of God?’It is said, ‘Since ‘Tahlil is testifying to the Unity of the Sublime God, and uprooting all deities other than God. It is the foundation of faith and is greater than ‘Tasbih or ‘Tahmid.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there a ‘Takbir at the beginning of the prayer and in each bowing down and prostrating?’ It is said, ‘It is for the same reason that we have mentioned about saying it in the ‘Azan.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there some supplications said in the first unit of the prayer before reciting the (required) verse (of the Holy Qur’an), but the ‘Qunut (a.s.upplicating during the prayer) is said after reciting the (required) verse (of the Holy Qur’an) in the second unit of the prayer?’It is said, ‘He dearly loved that His servants start their standing up for their Lord and worshipping Him by reciting His praises, sanctifying Him, being inclined towards Him and being humble to Him, and end it all in a similar fashion. Moreover, this is so that there is some possibility for him to extend his prayer in the ‘Qunut in congregational prayers, so that he can become synchronized with others in the other units and his unit of prayer does not fall out of synchronism with the congregation’s prayer.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to recite the Qur’an in our prayers?’It is said, ‘It is so that the Qur’an is not put aside and abandoned; and it be memorized and stay in the hearts not getting forgotten or destroyed.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why should we start each prayer recitation by reciting the Opening Chapter (‘Fatiha) and not any of the other (Qur’anic) chapters?’It is said, ‘This is because nowhere else in the Qur’an is there such a vast amount of good words and wisdom compiled together as there is in the Opening Chapter (‘Fatiha). That is when the Sublime God says, ‘Praisebe to Allah’ this would constitute the fulfillment of what the Sublime God has made incumbent upon His creatures in terms of expressing their gratitude to Him for whatever good He has granted His servants success in achieving. Saying ‘the Lord of the Two Worlds’ constitutes exalting and praising Him, testifying to Him that He is the Creator, the Owner and no one else is.Saying ‘The Most Gracious, Most Merciful’ constitutes seeking the pleasure of God and mentioning His Favours and Blessings for all His creatures.Saying ‘The Master of the Day of Judgment’ constitutes testifying to being resurrected, returning, reckoning and being punished. It also means considering the Dominion of the Hereafter for Him as the Dominion of this world is His.Saying ‘Thee do we worship’ constitutes being inclined towards Him and seeking proximity to the Honorable the Exalted God, sincerity of actions for Him and no one else.Saying ‘and Thine aid we seek’ constitutes seeking an increase in the success granted by Him, an increase in worshipping Him, the continuation of the blessings God has granted and His Assistance.Saying ‘and Show us the straight way’ constitutes seeking His Guidance towards His Discipline, grabbing onto His Rope, asking Him for an increase of one’s recognition of his Lord, His Glory, His Greatness and His Almightiness.Saying ‘The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace’ constitutes an emphasis on asking for and being inclined towards Him. It also constitutes mentioning what He has granted and His Blessings which He has given to His friends. It also constitutes asking the same things for oneself.Saying ‘those whose (portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray’ constitutes seeking refuge in Him from becoming one of the enemies or unbelievers; or becoming one who underestimates Him, what He enjoins to be done and what He admonishes against.Saying ‘…and who go not astray’ constitutes a form of grabbing onto Him so as not to be amongst those who have gone astray - those who have strayed away from His Path without recognition and thinking that they were doing good deeds.Therefore, (the Opening Chapter of the Qur’an) is a valuable collection of goodness and wisdom regarding the affairs of the Hereafter as well as this world in such a way that it does not exist anywhere else.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish ‘Tasbih in the bowing down and prostration?’It is said, ‘It is for several reasons. One of them is that the servant sanctifies God by being subordinate to Him; submits to Him; worships Him; fears Him; is humble to Him; and seeks proximity to his Lord. Another reason is that the servant be the one to praise, glorify, obey, exalt and thank his Creator and Sustainer, so that his mind is not misguided and his aspirations take him to others than God.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish the basic prayer to be two units, and one unit is added to some of the prayers and two units is added to some of the other prayers, and no units have been added to other prayers?’It is said, ‘It is because the basic prayer is just one unit, since the basic number is one. If it was less than one, it would not constitute a prayer. The Honorable the Exalted God knew that the servants would not always perform one unit of prayer perfectly, completely and with full attention. Therefore, He added another unit of prayer to it to complete the possible deficiencies one may have in the performance of one unit of prayer with saying two units of prayer. Hence, the Honorable, the Exalted God made the basic two-unit prayer obligatory. Then God’s Messenger (a.s.) knew that the servants would not totally and perfectly perform these two units which they are ordered to perform. Therefore, he added another two units to the noon, afternoon and night prayers to compensate for any deficiencies one may have in saying the first two units. Then he knew that the evening prayer is to be said when most of the people are busy working. Then they stop work to go home to break their fast, eat and drink, make ablutions, and prepare to go to sleep. Thus he added only one unit to the evening prayer to make it easier on them. He left the Morning Prayer as it was in order for the number of daily prayer units said to be an odd number. This was also because people are busier in the morning attending to their needs. Moreover, their hearts are not so involved with other thoughts due to the lack of doing business then, and are not tired. Thus man would be more attentive to his prayer in the morning in comparison to his other prayers, since his mind is free of daily activities.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it established to say ‘God is the Greatest!’ seven times at the beginning of the prayer?”It is said, ‘It is so because there are seven instances of saying ‘God is the Greatest!’ in the first unit - that is the basic prayer which consists of: one to start, one for bowing down, two for prostration, another one when bowing down and another two for the second prostration. That is why if a man says all the seven instances of ‘God is the Greatest!’ in the beginning of his prayer, he has said all the seven; and should he mistakenly forget to say anyone of them, there would be no insufficiencies in his prayer.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there one bowing down and two prostrations in each unit?”It is said, ‘Bowing down is a part of the prayer said while standing up, and prostration is the part of prayer said while sitting down. Prayer said while sitting down counts as half of the prayer said while standing up. That is why prostration is doubled so as to make it weigh the same as the bowing down, so that there is no difference between them since prayer is indeed made up of the bowing down and the prostration.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is the call as a witness (tashahhud) established after the bowing down and the prostration?”It is said, ‘It is because calling as a witness has been decreed before the bowing down and prostration in the ‘Azan, the supplications and the recitations. Therefore, He ordered that calling as a witness, praising and supplications also be said after them.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish the saying of ‘Salaam as the termination of the prayer, and did not set saying ‘God is the Greatest!’ or ‘Glory be to God!’ or something else instead to end the prayer?”It is said, ‘So that it be coordinated with the entrance into the prayer. After starting the prayers, it is forbidden to talk to the creatures, and one should only attend to the Creator. Therefore, He terminates the parayers with the creature’s word and turns one’s attention over to them as people start speaking to each other by saying ‘Salaam.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘why is there reciting the Qur’anic Chapters in the first two units and saying the glorifications in the last two units of the prayer?’It is said, ‘This is in order to make a clear distinction between what the Honorable the Exalted God made incumbent Himself and what His Messenger (a.s.) made incumbent upon the believers (as the last two units of the prayer were added by the Prophet (S)).’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there congregational prayers?’It is said, ‘It is so that sincerity, the belief in Unity, Islam and the worship of God are publicly seen, since this would serve as a proof of the One the Honorable the Exalted God for the people of the East and the West. It will also serve as a means by which the hypocrites and those who underestimate the prayer would at least have to publicly perform what they claim to adhere to. It will also serve as a means for the Muslims to testify to the adherence of their fellow Muslim brethren to Islam. There are also other certain benefits in congregational prayers such as encouragement to do good deeds and advising to piety, and admonishing against doing many of the acts of disobedience to the Honorable the Exalted God.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are some prayers to be said in a loud voice while others are not?’It is said, ‘The prayers that are to be said in a loud voice are those that are performed in the darkness of the night. They should be said in a loud voice so that if anyone is passing by he can tell that a congregational prayer is being held there and he can attend it if he wishes to do so. If he does not see the group of people, at least he can hear them and get informed through hearing. Regarding the prayers that are performed in the daytime, a passer-by can see the people praying and there is no need for him to be able to hear them pray.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the prayers established for these certain times, not sooner or later?”It is said, ‘Since these times are known by everyone on the Earth. Therefore, the ignorant and the knowledgeable ones knew these four times: Sunset is well-known and clear, thus the evening prayer is made incumbent at that time. The disappearance of the evening twilight is well-known and clear, thus the night prayer is made incumbent at that time. Sunrise is well-known and clear, thus the morning prayer is made incumbent at that time. The sun’s noon position is well-known and clear,that is why the noon prayer is incumbent at that time. There is no clearly defined time for the afternoon prayer as there is for the other prayers. Its time has been established to be after finishing the noon prayer.Another reason is that the Honorable the Exalted God likes that the people start doing everything by obeying and worshipping Him. That is why He has ordered them to worship Him at the beginning of the day and then engage in what they themselves like to do to improve their worldly affairs. Thus He made it incumbent upon them to say the morning prayer.When midday comes and the people stop working, they take off their clothes, relax, eat and rest. God has ordered them to start this by mentioning and worshipping Him first and has thus made it incumbent upon them to say the noon prayers first and then do the other things that they like to do. Once they want to go out to do what they like, God has made it incumbent upon them to say the afternoon prayers and then go after what improves their worldly affairs. And once the night comes, they quit work and return home, they must begin with the worship of their Lord. Thus God has made it incumbent upon them to say the evening prayer. Once it is time to go to sleep and they are relieved of their daily affairs, God likes them to first attend to His worship and obedience and then pursue their own affairs. Thus they should start each section of the day with performing His obedience and worship. Therefore, God has made it incumbent upon them to do the night prayer. Once they do so they will not forget Him, become neglectful of Him, their hearts will not get hard, and their inclination to God will not decrease.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there not a clearly defined time for the afternoon prayer like the other prayers? Why is it that it is done between the noon and the evening prayers and not between the night and the morning prayers, or between the morning and the noon prayers?’It is said, ‘Since no time is easier and more convenient than this time for both the weak and the powerful people. All the people attend to their work from the beginning of the day: such as doing business; making deals; going after their necessities; and opening their shops. Thus God did not want to hinder them from seeking their sustenance and improving their worldly life.All the people cannot get up at night. They do not even understand what waking up at night is. If it be made obligatory that they will wake up todo it even if it were in the middle of the night - this is not very feasible for them to do. Thus God has facilitated it for them and has not set the prayer for the hardest times to say as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…Allah intends every facility for you; He does not want to put you to difficulties…’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘What are the reasons for raising the hands when saying ‘Takbir?’It is said, ‘The reason for raising the hands when saying ‘Takbir is that this act involves a certain degree of invocation and supplication. The Honorable the Exalted God likes His servant to be invoking and supplicating to Him at the time of remembering Him. Thus by raising the hands, one becomes more attentive to and more thoughtful of what he intends to say and what he says.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the recommendable prayers thirty-four units?’It is said, ‘Since the obligatory prayers are seventeen units. The recommendable prayers have been established to be double that amount to perfect the obligatory ones.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the recommendable prayers set for various times and not for a fixed given time?’It is said, ‘Since the best of the times are three: dawn, noon and then evening. God likes that the people pray to Him at these three times. Also, if the prayers are spread around at different times rather than all being set for a fixed given time, they are easier to perform for all the people.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that the Friday prayer is only two units if said with the prayer leader, but it is four units if it is not said with a prayer leader?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them being that the people come from far distances to say the congregational prayers. The Honorable the Exalted God likes to give them a discount, and make it easier for them considering the distance that they have covered. Another reason is that the prayer leader keeps them there to deliver the sermon, and they have to wait for the prayer. In fact, whoever is waiting to pray it is as if he is praying, and this is considered to be a perfect prayer by itself. Another reason is that saying the prayer with a prayer leader is more complete due to the prayer leader’s knowledge, jurisprudence, justness, and nobility.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has it been established to deliver sermons?’It is said, ‘Since on Fridays the people gather together. Delivering sermons is a means by which the prayer leader can advise the people and encourage them to obey God. He may admonish them against committing sins, inform them about what would improve their religious and worldly affairs, inform them about the various issues and the conditions which might lead to their benefit or loss.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why have two sermons been designated (for the congregational prayer)?’It is said, ‘So that there is one sermon in which to glorify, praise and sanctify the Honorable the Exalted God, and there is another one in which they attend to the needs of the people; admonish the people against committing sins and violating the laws; supplicate (to God); express what they wish to teach the people; and advise and admonish the people regarding what would lead to improvements or corruption.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has it been established that the Friday sermons be delivered before the prayers, but be delivered after the prayers on holidays?’It is said, ‘Since Friday prayers are to be held every week of the month and every month of the year. Also since it is said that often the people might leave the prayer after it is said, if the sermons were to be delivered after saying the prayers. Once the people say the prayers they would disperse and not wait for the sermon, and most or all of them might not stay for the sermon. Therefore, the sermon is to be delivered before the prayers, so that the people do not disperse or leave when the sermons are delivered. However, there are only two ‘Eid prayers each year which are much more magnificent than the Friday prayers, and many more people attend the ‘Eid prayers, since more of them are interested in attending them. Even if some people decide to leave after saying the prayers, most of the people still remain. The sermon is also not repeated, so it will not be so boring that the people ignore it.’The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) - may God have Mercy upon him - said, ‘This is how this tradition has been narrated. However, the sermons in both the Friday prayers and the ‘Eid (holiday) prayers are delivered after the prayer, since they are considered as the two final unitsof the prayers. The first one who said the sermons before the prayers was Uthman ibn Affan, since the people detested him for his wrongdoings. They did not stay after the prayers to listen to his sermons and thought to themselves that his sermons were of no use, since he had done whatever he wanted to do. Therefore, he delivered the two sermons before the prayers, so that at least the people would wait for the prayer and not disperse.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that attending the Friday prayers is made incumbent upon those who live at a distance of at most two ‘Farsakhs away from where the prayers are held and no more?’It is said, ‘The distance for which the prayers will be shortened, if traveled back and forth is eight ‘Farsakhs, that is four ‘Farsakhs to go and four ‘Farsakhs to return. Attending the Friday prayers is made incumbent upon the people who live at most half that distance away. Thus, the distance traveled is not as much as would result in the shortening of the prayers. Rather it is half as much as once covered by someone, he would be considered a traveler.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are four units of prayers added to the recommendable prayers on Fridays?’It is said, ‘It is to honor this day and make a distinction between it and other days.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the prayers shortened when we are on a journey?’It is said, ‘Since the obligatory prayers were ten units to start with and the other seven units were added to them later. Therefore, God deleted the additional seven units while we are on a journey due to the hardships of traveling and the efforts we must exert in terms of going and stopping at the way-stations in the performance of our own affairs. This shortening of the prayers is a form of Mercy from God and it is due to His Kindness - except for the evening prayers which cannot be shortened, since they are shortened to begin with.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is shortening the prayers valid after you travel eight ‘Farsakhs back and forth - no more and no less?’It is said, ‘Since eight ‘Farsakhs is the distance which all people can travel back and forth in a single day - whether they walk, ride, are in a convoy or a caravan, or carry loads. That is why the extent of distance for shortening the prayers has been established to be the distance of one-day’s travel back and forth.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is shortening the prayers made incumbent for a distance of one day’s travel back and forth and no more?’It is said, ‘If a limit of a distance for one day’s travel was not established for shortening the prayers, then even the distance of one year’s travel would not have been established. This is because days come one after another and they are all similar to each other. If it were not established for this day, it would not have been established for any other day since all the other days are similar to each other and there is no differences between them.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘There are some differences in the speed of traveling. Why was the distance of eight ‘Farsakhs established as the distance of one day’s traveling back and forth?’It is said, ‘Since eight ‘Farsakhs is the distance which camels and the caravans usually travel in one day, and thus it is the distance which the people riding camels and the caravans can travel in one day.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the recommendable prayers (nafila) for the daytime abandoned, but the recommendable prayers for the night still valid?’It is said, ‘The recommendable prayers for any of the prayers which are not shortened on a journey are still said. That is why the recommendable prayer for the evening prayer which must be said in the same way whether we are at home or on a journey, are still said. Also all the recommendable prayers after the evening prayer and the Morning Prayer which is not shortened, and the recommendable prayers before it are still said.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the recommendable prayers for the night prayer which is shortened on a journey still said?’It is said, ‘These two units are not included amongst the fifty units of the obligatory and recommendable prayers. Rather they have been added to the fifty units, so that for each unit of obligatory prayer there are two units of recommendable prayers.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are those on a journey and the ill permitted to perform their night prayers at the nightfall?’It is said, ‘Since a traveler has some things to take care of and the ill have some weaknesses requiring them to rest at night. Therefore, they have been permitted to say their night prayers at the nightfall, so that the ill can rest and the traveler can attend to the affairs related to his journey.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to say prayers for the dead?’It is said, ‘In order to intercede on their behalf and to ask God’s forgiveness for them, since there is no other time than just after death in which the passed-away person is in need of intercession and asking God to forgive him.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there five ‘Takbirs in the prayer for the dead, not four or six?’It is said, ‘There is one for each of the five daily prayers.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why is there no bowing down or prostration in the prayer for the dead?’It is said, ‘Since this prayer is meant as an intercession for him. What this servant has left behind is of no use to him now and he needs what he has sent ahead.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to perform the burial ceremonial bath for the dead?’It is said, ‘Since when someone dies, filth, calamities and harm overcomes the corpse. Now that he is going to meet the pure ones from the angels who will accompany him and touch him, he likes to be clean and pure himself and be taken towards the Honorable the Exalted God in a clean state. Whoever dies, the sperm with which he was at first created will be discharged from his body and he will be in a state of major ritual impurity. Thus he must have the major ritual ablution performed for him.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to shroud the corpse?’It is said, ‘So that he meets his Lord - the Honorable the Exalted - with a clean corpse, his private parts are not seen by those who carry and buryhim, the people cannot see his state and the ugliness of the sight. The change of odor when looking at bodies infected with some diseases a lot would make one hard-hearted due to the decay and defects in them. The corpse is shrouded so that it looks good to the on-lookers and his friends do not see his decayed naked body which would result in detesting him. Also seeing the corpse would make them forget him, abandon his friendship, not make an effort to protect what he has left behind, not act upon his will as well as abandon what he has willed whether it be incumbent or recommendable.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to bury him?”It is said, ‘So that the decay of his corpse, the ugly scene and the bad smell is not experienced by the people. Also its smell should not bother the living, and its scars, injuries and decay are hidden from the sight of his friends and enemies, so as not to please his enemies or sadden his friends.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has the one performing the major ritual ablution for the dead been ordered to perform the major ablution himself?”It is said, ‘It is because he must be cleansed of the water splashed on him from the corpse, since once the spirit leaves the body of the dead, many injuries, scars and causes of infection remain on the corpse.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why then is it not obligatory to perform the major ritual ablution for touching the dead carcasses of other beings than men - such as birds, grazing or ravenous animals, and similar creatures?It is said, ‘It is because they have either feathers, wool, hair or fluff which do not perish and remain clean. It makes no difference whether you touch them when the animal is dead or alive.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why is it allowed to say the prayer for the dead without making ablutions?’It is said, ‘It is because this prayer consists of no bowing down or prostration and is merely supplications and requesting. It is permitted to supplicate to God and ask Him (for something) in any condition. Making ablutions is obligatory for prayers in which there is bowing down and prostration.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it allowed to say the funeral prayers before evening time and after the morning?’It is said, ‘It is because this prayer must be said whenever the corpse is present. Therefore, the reason is simply the presence of the corpse. There is no set time for it like other prayers. This is a form of prayer that is to be said whenever something happens which is not under man’s control. It is only a right that must be honored, and nothing else. One can honor the rights whenever he can. There is no set time for that.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there a prayer to be said when there is an eclipse?’It is said, ‘It is because an eclipse is one of the signs of the Honorable the Exalted God. It is not clear whether it will result in Mercy or Chastisement. That is why the Prophet (S) desired that his nation turn to their Creator and His Mercy when it occurs. Thereby they would be relieved of the evil and would be protected from its possible harm as the people of Yunus (a.s.) did when they beseeched the Honorable the Exalted God.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there ten times of bowing down in it?’It is said, ‘The prayer which has been made incumbent (upon man for an eclipse) and has descended from the heavens to the Earth was ten units and consisted of ten times of bowing down. All the ten times are put together in this prayer. There cannot be a prayer with bowing down and prostration. Therefore, prostration is made incumbent in this prayer. Moreover, this prayer has prostration in it so that the people can terminate their prayers with humbleness. Therefore, four prostrations have been set in the eclipse prayer and the prayer is invalidated whenever any of them is forgotten, since four prostrations is the minimum requirement for each prayer.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why were the bowing downs substituted with prostrations?’It is said, ‘It is because praying while standing up is nobler than praying while sitting down. Also one who is standing would see the eclipse, and its termination while one who is prostrating would not see it.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are its fundamentals changed from what God has made incumbent (upon man in prayer)?’It is said, ‘It is because this prayer is designated for changes in the normal sequence of natural events - that is the eclipse. Since the cause has changed, the result will also change.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has the day for breaking the fast been established as a holiday?’It is said, ‘It is so that there are congregations in which Muslims gather together on that day, stand before the Honorable the Exalted God and praise Him for what He has bestowed upon them. That day is considered to be a special holiday and it is the day for the people to gather together. It is the day to break the fast, pay the alms-tax, long for and be humble to God, since that is the first day of the new year in which eating and drinking is allowed. This is because for the people of the truth the first month of the year is the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan. Thus, the Honorable the Exalted God likes them to hold congregations on that day in which they get together to praise and sanctify Him.’\u003Cbr\u003E \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there more ‘Takbirs in it compared to all other prayers?’ It is said, ‘Since ‘Takbir constitutes glorifying God and thanking Him for guidance and health as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…(He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful.’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there twelve ‘Takbirs in the congregation prayer on the ‘Eid prayer for Ramadhan?’It is said, ‘It is because there are twelve ‘Takbirs in each two units of prayers. Thus there are twelve ‘Takbirs in the congregation prayer on the ‘Eid prayer for Ramadhan.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there seven ‘Takbirs in the first unit and five in the second? Why are there not the same number of ‘Takbirs in each unit?’ It is said, ‘Since there are seven ‘Takbirs in the obligatory prayers, the first unit of this prayers starts with seven ‘Takbirs. There are five ‘Takbirs in the second unit, since there are a total of five ‘Takbirs to start all the daily prayers (one for each prayer). This is also done so that the number of ‘Takbirs in each prayer be an odd number.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to fast?’ It is said, ‘It is so that you can realize the feeling of hunger, thirst, and poverty in the Hereafter. It is also because by fasting you show reverence, humbleness and submissiveness, so that you patiently and knowingly benefit from your suffering thirst and hunger. In addition, fasting serves as a means of the elimination of lust; and acts as an advisor for you for the present; apractice for you to perform your duties and a proof for the Hereafter. Also fasting is a means for you to realize the extent of hardships suffered from poverty in this world, so as give to the poor the portion of your property which God has made incumbent upon you to pay to them.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is fasting established to be done in the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan and not in the other months?’It is said, ‘It is because Ramadhan is the month in which the Sublime God sent down the Qur’an in which there exists what would distinguish between right and wrong as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur’an, as a guide to mankind, also clear (a.s.igns) for guidance and judgment (Between right and wrong)…’ The revelations were revealed to Muhammad (a.s.) in that month. The Night of Power (‘Qadr) is better than a thousand months and ‘In the (Night) is made distinct every affair of wisdom.’ It is the beginning of the year on which everything - whether good or bad, loss or gain, life or death - is destined. That is why it is called the Night of Power (‘Qadr).’And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to fast during the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan - no more and no less?’It is said, ‘It is because that is the extent of fasting which both the weak ones and the strong ones can tolerate. God has made incumbent upon man the obligatory deeds to the extent that the majority of the people can do them. Then He has given the weak ones some leeway and has encouraged the strong ones to do more. If less than this was better for them, God would have made less than this incumbent upon them and if more than this was better for them, God would have made more than this incumbent upon them.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why should a menstruating woman neither pray nor fast?’It is said, ‘Since she is in an unclean state then and God does not like us to worship Him unless we are clean. Moreover, whoever cannot pray cannot fast.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why should she make up her fasting but not make up her prayers?’It is said, ‘There are several reasons for this. One of them is that fasting would not hinder her from doing her usual daily chores: such as her personal affairs; serving her husband; fixing things in the house; attending to the affairs of the house; and engaging in the affairs of life. However, praying would prevent her from doing all these things, since prayers are repeated over and over every day. A woman does not have enough strength to do this. However, fasting is not that way. Another reason is that praying involves exertion of an effort to sit down, stand up, and move up and down but fasting does not involve any of these acts. Fasting only consists of not eating and drinking. The body parts are not involved in it. Another reason is that there is always some prayers which must be said during the day and the night. However, fasting is not so. It is not like praying which is incumbent upon one to do every day. It is not incumbent upon one to fast every day.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it the case that for someone who is ill during the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan and does not get better until the next Ramadhan, or is on a journey during the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan and does not end his journey up until the next Ramadhan, the fasting days he missed should not be made up, and it suffices for him to pay for the compensation of it? Why is it the case that if such a person gets well or his journey ends before the next Ramadhan should make up his missed fasts and also pay for the compensation?’It is said, ‘Fasting was incumbent upon him during the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan of that year. It was put off to a later time since he was ill or on a journey. He is excused from fasting since he did not get better during the year or his journey did not end, but he must pay for the compensation of his missed fasting days. This is because the Sublime God has sent the illness upon him and he has not found a way to get better. God has not left any means of performing his duty for him, since an ill person cannot fast. One who is on a journey should not fast either. Therefore, he is excused from fasting. The same holds true for anything else which God brings upon him such as becoming unconscious. Let’s suppose someone is unconscious for one day. He does not have to make up the prayers for that day as (Imam) As-Sadiq (a.s.) said, ‘God has excused His servants from anything which God Himself descends upon him.’ Since at the beginning of Ramadhan, he has been excused from fasting and this excuse has remained valid until the next year, then hemust pay the compensation, and he does not have to make up the fasts. He is like someone who is always unable to fast as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘\u003Cbr\u003E And if any has not (the wherewithal), he should fast for two months consecutively before they touch each other. But if any is unable to do so, he should feed sixty indigent ones…’And as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…(He should) in compensation either fast, or feed the poor, or offer sacrifice…’ Here giving charity has been established as a compensation for fasting when the Hajj pilgrim is in a distressful state.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘What if he was not able to make it up then, but is able to do so now?It is said, ‘Since his excuse has remained valid until the next Ramadhan, God’s decree regarding him is that he pay the compensation for the missed days of fasting. He is considered to be like someone who must pay the compensation for missing his fasts due to some act and cannot fast. Thus he does not have to fast, but he must pay the compensation. However, if he gets well before the next Ramadhan, but does not make up the days for the missed fasting days, he must make up the fasting and pay the compensation that is due to be paid by him, since he has been able to make up that fasting.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there recommendable fasts?’It is said, ‘They exist so as to complete the obligatory fasts.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there three designated days (for recommendable fasts) each month and one day (for recommendable fasts) in each ten days of the month?’It is said, ‘It is because the Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit…’ Therefore, whoever fasts one day out of each ten days, it is as if he has fasted the whole year long as Salman al-Farsi - may God have Mercy upon him - said, ‘Fasting three days each month is considered to be fasting all the time. Whoever finds more time should fast more.’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are recommendable fasts set for the Thursdays of the first and the last ten days of the month, as well as the Wednesdays of the second ten days of the month?’It is said, ‘As for Thursday (Imam) As-Sadiq (a.s.) said, ‘A servant’s (i.e. a person’s) deeds are presented to the Honorable the Exalted God each Thursday. Thus God likes His servants to be fasting when the servants’ deeds are presented to the Sublime God.”’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why are recommendable fasts set for the last Thursday of the month?’It is said, ‘Since it is better during the third ten days of the month if the servant’s deeds for the last eight days are presented to God while he has fasted than if his deeds for only two days are of his deeds presented to God while he has fasted. Also Wednesday has been set in the middle ten days of each month, since (Imam) As-Sadiq (a.s.) narrated, ‘The Honorable the Exalted God created Fire on this day. He destroyed the previous nations (who sinned) on that day. It is a day which always has (been considered to be a ) bad omen. And God likes his servant to fend off the bad omen from himself by fasting.’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it incumbent upon those who do not have the financial means to fast as expiation. Why can’t they go on the Hajj pilgrimage, pray or do other (good) deeds as expiation?’It is said, ‘It is because praying, going on the Hajj pilgrimage and other obligatory deeds would hinder one from attending to his worldly affairs and improving his life. The same reason cited for making up the fast of the semi-menstruant who should only make up her fast not her prayers applies here, too.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has the expiation been established to be fasting for two consecutive months? Why is it not one month or three months?’It is said, ‘It is because God has made fasting for one month incumbent upon the people. He doubled the fasting days to be an expiation so as to emphasize the importance of fasting and be stern.’If he asks, ‘Why did He establish the compensation for fasting to be two consecutive months?’It is said, ‘It is so that they do not underestimate fasting. If the fasting is performed spread over a span of time, it would not seem to be that difficult.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to go on the Hajj pilgrimage?It is said, ‘It is because it is a form of going towards God; asking him for numerous rewards; and departing from all (evil) that one has committed; to be repentant for all that he has done in the past; and to start what he will do in the future.The Hajj pilgrimage is also done so that one can expend his wealth and puts himself to trouble; experiences separation from his spouse and children; avoids lust and pleasure; suffers from the troubles of the trip in the heat, cold, and fear for a long span of time along with humility, courtesy and humbleness. The Hajj pilgrimage also benefits the people in the East or the West of the Earth - whether they live in the deserts or at sea; partake in the Hajj pilgrimage or not; import goods; do business; sell or buy; are dealers or the needy; rent riding animals or are too poor to rent any riding animals to go on the Hajj pilgrimage. It also includes the fulfillment of the needs of the people who live in the vicinity where the Hajj pilgrims gather together.It also includes the training of and the narration of the traditions from the Immaculate Leaders (a.s.) from one region over to another region as the Sublime God said, ‘Nor should the Believers all go forth together: if a contingent from every expedition remained behind, they could devote themselves to studies in religion, and admonish the people when they return to them,- that thus they (may learn) to guard themselves (against evil).’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to go on the Hajj pilgrimage once and not more?”It is said, ‘It is because the Sublime God established the obligatory deeds taking into consideration the weakest people as the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘…He must make an offering, such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it…’ This refers to a sheep that both the rich and the poor can offer. The other obligatory deeds are the same way and are established considering the weakest people. One of the obligatory deeds is to go on the Hajj pilgrimage which is obligatory once in one’s lifetime. God has encouraged the rich people to perform it as often as they can.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to go on the ‘Tamatu (major) Hajj pilgrimage?”It is said, ‘This is a mitigation from your Lord and is out of His Mercy, so that the people may leave their state of ritual consecration for the Hajj, and this period does not become too long for them making them enter into corruption. Both (major) Hajj and ‘Umra (minor Hajj) are obligatory. Remaining in the state of consecration for the first one is like voiding the consecration for the second one. That is so that Hajj is not performed without ‘Umra, and there would be a clear distinction between them. And the Prophet (S) said, ‘‘Umra is attached to Hajj all the way up until the Resurrection Day.’ Had the Prophet (S) not brought an offering along and could leave the state of ritual consecration, he (a.s.) would have done as he ordered the people to do. That is why the Prophet (S) said, ‘Had I not brought my offering along with me, I would have performed my last deed as I ordered you to do. However I have brought along the offering, and one who brings along the offering cannot leave the state of ritual consecration for the Hajj until he makes the offering.’ Then a man stood up and said, ‘O God’s Prophet! Will we leave as Hajji’s while sperm is dripping down our heads due to major ritual impurity?’ The Prophet (S) told him, ‘You will never ever believe in this.’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has its time been established to be during the first ten days of the (Arabic) month of Dhul-Hajja?It is said, ‘The Sublime God likes His servants to worship Him during the period of ‘Tashriq since these days are the days on which the angels went on the Hajj pilgrimage for God for the first time (and the days) during which they circumambulated around Him. Then He established this as a tradition for mankind all the way up until the Resurrection Day. And the Prophets Adam (a.s.), Noah (a.s.), Abraham (a.s.), Moses (a.s.), Jesus (a.s.) and Muhammad (a.s.) and all the other Prophets performed the Hajj pilgrimage during the same period of time. This has become a tradition for their progeny all the way up until the Resurrection Day.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to enter the state of ritual consecration for the Hajj (by wearing ‘Ihram)?’It is said, ‘That is so as to be humble before entering the Honorable the Exalted God’s Shrine and His Protection. That is so as to quit licentiousness; engaging in worldly affairs, its ornaments and pleasures;to struggle hard to achieve what they have set out to do there; to go towards doing what they have set out to do; as well as what there is in the ‘Ihram including the exaltation of the Sublime God and His House. Entering the state of ritual consecration means humbleness to Him, hoping His Rewards; fearing His Chastisements; going towards Him in a state of humbleness, subordination and submissiveness. And blessings be upon Muhammad (a.s.) and his Household.’Abdul Wahid Muhammad ibn Ubdoos al-Neishaboori al-Attar - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Qutayba al-Neishaboori quoted on the authority of Al-Fadhl ibn Shathan who heard these narrations on the reasons behind decrees I told him, “Let me know whether these reasons which you expressed were out of your own understanding and deductions due to the results of intellectual reasoning or you have heard them and are narrating them?” He told me, “I am not one to know the Sublime God’s purpose behind what He has made incumbent (upon us), or know the purpose of God’s Messenger (a.s.) for what he has decreed and established as tradition. Neither can I express the reasons myself. However, what I have expressed was what I have heard from my Master (Imam) Abil Hassan Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) on different occasions, one after the other. Then I compiled them together.” Then I asked him, “Can I narrate these traditions on your authority on the authority of Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)?” He replied, “Yes.”Al-Hakim Abu Muhammad Ja’far ibn Nu’aym ibn Shathan - may God be pleased with him - narrated that his uncle Abi Abdullah Muhammad ibn Shathan quoted on the authority of Al-Fadhl ibn Shathan, “I heard this reasoning from my Master Abil Hassan ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) on different occasions, and I compiled them together.",

وَنَهْيِهِ إِذْ كَانَ فِيهِ صَلاحُهُمْ وَقِوَامُهُمْ فَلَوْ تُرِكُوا بِغَيْرِ تَعَبُّدٍ لَطَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ الأَمَدُ فَقَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُم.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِالصَّلاةِ قِيلَ لانَّ فِي الصَّلاةِ الإِقْرَارَ بِالرُّبُوبِيَّةِ وَهُوَصَلاحٌ عَامٌّ لانَّ فِيهِ خَلْعَ الأَنْدَادِ وَالْقِيَامَ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ الْجَبَّارِ بِالذُّلِّ وَالاسْتِكَانَةِ وَالْخُضُوعِ وَالاعْتِرَافِ وَطَلَبِ الإِقَالَةِ مِنْ سَالِفِ الذُّنُوبِ وَوَضْعَ الْجَبْهَةِ عَلَى الأَرْضِ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ وَلَيْلَةٍ لِيَكُونَ الْعَبْدُ ذَاكِراً لِلَّهِ تَعَالَى غَيْرَ نَاسٍ لَهُ وَيَكُونَ خَاشِعاً وَجِلاً مُتَذَلِّلاً طَالِباً رَاغِباً فِي الزِّيَادَةِ لِلدِّينِ وَالدُّنْيَا مَعَ مَا فِيهِ مِنَ الانْزِجَارِ عَنِ الْفَسَادِ وَصَارَ ذَلِكَ عَلَيْهِ فِي كُلِّ يَوْمٍ وَلَيْلَةٍ لِئَلا يَنْسَى الْعَبْدُ مُدَبِّرَهُ وَخَالِقَهُ فَيَبْطَرَ وَيَطْغَى وَلِيَكُونَ فِي ذِكْرِ خَالِقِهِ وَالْقِيَامِ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ رَبِّهِ زَاجِراً لَهُ عَنِ الْمَعَاصِي وَحَاجِزاً وَمَانِعاً عَنْ أَنْوَاعِ الْفَسَادِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِالْوُضُوءِ وَبُدِئَ بِهِ؟قِيلَ لأنْ يَكُونَ الْعَبْدُ طَاهِراً إِذَا قَامَ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ الْجَبَّارِ عِنْدَ مُنَاجَاتِهِ إِيَّاهُ مُطِيعاً لَهُ فِيَما أَمَرَهُ نَقِيّاً مِنَ الأَدْنَاسِ وَالنَّجَاسَةِ مَعَ مَا فِيهِ مِنْ ذَهَابِ الْكَسَلِ وَطَرْدِ النُّعَاسِ وَتَزْكِيَةِ الْفُؤَادِ لِلْقِيَامِ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ الْجَبَّارِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ لِمَ وَجَبَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى الْوَجْهِ وَالْيَدَيْنِ وَالرَّأْسِ وَالرِّجْلَيْنِ قِيلَ لانَّ الْعَبْدَ إِذَا قَامَ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ الْجَبَّارِ فَإِنَّمَا يَنْكَشِفُ مِنْ جَوَارِحِهِ وَيُظْهِرُ مَا وَجَبَ فِيهِ الْوُضُوءُ وَذَلِكَ أَنَّهُ بِوَجْهِهِ يَسْجُدُ وَيَخْضَعُ وَبِيَدِهِ يَسْأَلُ وَيَرْغَبُ وَيَرْهَبُ وَيَتَبَتَّلُ وَيَنْسُكُ وَبِرَأْسِهِ يَسْتَقْبِلُ فِي رُكُوعِهِ وَسُجُودِهِ وَبِرِجْلَيْهِ يَقُومُ وَيَقْعُدُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ وَجَبَ الْغَسْلُ عَلَى الْوَجْهِ وَالْيَدَيْنِ وَجُعِلَ الْمَسْحُ عَلَى الرَّأْسِ وَالرِّجْلَيْنِ وَلَمْ يُجْعَلْ ذَلِكَ غَسْلاً كُلُّهُ أَوْ مَسْحاً كُلُّهُ قِيلَ لِعِلَلٍ شَتَّى مِنْهَا أَنَّ الْعِبَادَةَ الْعُظْمَى إِنَّمَا هِيَ الرُّكُوعُ وَالسُّجُودُ وَإِنَّمَا يَكُونُ الرُّكُوعُ وَالسُّجُودُ بِالْوَجْهِ وَالْيَدَيْنِ لا بِالرَّأْسِ وَالرِّجْلَيْنِ.وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الْخَلْقَ لا يُطِيقُونَ فِي كُلِّ وَقْتٍ غَسْلَ الرَّأْسِ وَالرِّجْلَيْنِ وَيَشْتَدُّ ذَلِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ فِي الْبَرْدِ وَالسَّفَرِ وَالْمَرَضِ وَأَوْقَاتٍ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَغَسْلُ الْوَجْهِ وَالْيَدَيْنِ أَخَفُّ مِنْ غَسْلِ الرَّأْسِ وَالرِّجْلَيْنِ وَإِنَّمَا وُضِعَتِ الْفَرَائِضُ عَلَى قَدْرِ أَقَلِّ النَّاسِ طَاقَةً مِنْ أَهْلِ الصِّحَّةِ ثُمَّ عُمَّ فِيهَا الْقَوِيُّ وَالضَّعِيفُ.وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الرَّأْسَ وَالرِّجْلَيْنِ لَيْسَا هُمَا فِي كُلِّ وَقْتٍ بَادِيَيْنِ ظَاهِرَيْنِ كَالْوَجْهِ وَالْيَدَيْنِ لِمَوْضِعِ الْعِمَامَةِ وَالْخُفَّيْنِ وَغَيْرِ ذَلِكَ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ وَجَبَ الْوُضُوءُ مِمَّا خَرَجَ مِنَ الطَّرَفَيْنِ خَاصَّةً وَمِنَ النَّوْمِ دُونَ سَائِرِ الأَشْيَاءِ قِيلَ لانَّ الطَّرَفَيْنِ هُمَا طَرِيقُ النَّجَاسَةِ وَلَيْسَ لِلإِنْسَانِ طَرِيقٌ تُصِيبُهُ النَّجَاسَةُ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ إِلا مِنْهُمَا فَأُمِرُوا بِالطَّهَارَةِ عِنْدَ مَا تُصِيبُهُمْ تِلْكَ النَّجَاسَةُ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ.وَأَمَّا النَّوْمُ فَإِنَّ النَّائِمَ إِذَا غَلَبَ عَلَيْهِ النَّوْمُ يُفْتَحُ كُلُّ شَيْ‏ءٍ مِنْهُ وَاسْتَرْخَى وَكَانَ أَغْلَبُ الأَشْيَاءِ عَلَيْهِ فِي الْخُرُوجِ مِنْهُ الرِّيحَ فَوَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْوُضُوءُ لِهَذِهِ الْعِلَّةِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ لَمْ يُؤْمَرُوا بِالْغُسْلِ مِنْ هَذِهِ النَّجَاسَةِ كَمَا أُمِرُوا بِالْغُسْلِ مِنَ الْجَنَابَةِ قِيلَ لانَّ هَذَا شَيْ‏ءٌ دَائِمٌ غَيْرُ مُمْكِنٍ لِلْخَلْقِ الاغْتِسَالُ مِنْهُ كُلَّمَا يُصِيبُ ذَلِكَ وَلا يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلا وُسْعَها وَالْجَنَابَةُ لَيْسَ [لَيْسَتْ] هِيَ أَمْراً دَائِماً إِنَّمَا هِيَ شَهْوَةٌ يُصِيبُهَا إِذَا أَرَادَ وَيُمْكِنُهُ تَعْجِيلُهَا وَتَأْخِيرُهَا الأَيَّامَ الثَّلاثَةَ وَالأَقَلَّ وَالأَكْثَرَ وَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ هَكَذَا.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِالْغُسْلِ مِنَ الْجَنَابَةِ وَلَمْ يُؤْمَرُوا بِالْغُسْلِ مِنَ الْخَلاءِ وَهُوَأَنْجَسُ مِنَ الْجَنَابَةِ وَأَقْذَرُ قِيلَ مِنْ أَجْلِ أَنَّ الْجَنَابَةَ مِنْ نَفْسِ الإِنْسَانِ وَهُوَشَيْ‏ءٌ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ جَمِيعِ جَسَدِهِ وَالْخَلاءُ لَيْسَ هُوَمِنْ نَفْسِ الإِنْسَانِ إِنَّمَا هُوَغِذَاءٌ يَدْخُلُ مِنْ بَابٍ وَيَخْرُجُ مِنْ بَابٍ.فَإِنْ قَالَ أَخْبِرْنِي عَنِ الأَذَانِ لِمَ أُمِرُوا بِهِ قِيلَ لِعِلَلٍ كَثِيرَةٍ مِنْهَا أَنْ يَكُونَ تَذْكِيراً لِلسَّاهِي وَتَنْبِيهاً لِلْغَافِلِ وَتَعْرِيفاً لِمَنْ جَهِلَ الْوَقْتَ وَاشْتَغَلَ عَنِ الصَّلاةِ وَلِيَكُونَ ذَلِكَ دَاعِياً إِلَى عِبَادَةِ الْخَالِقِ مُرَغِّباً فِيهَا مُقِرّاً لَهُ بِالتَّوْحِيدِ مُجَاهِراً بِالإِيمَانِ مُعْلِناً بِالإِسْلامِ مُؤَذِّناً لِمَنْ نَسِيَهَا وَإِنَّمَا يُقَالُ مُؤَذِّنٌ لانَّهُ يُؤَذِّنُ بِالصَّلاةِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ بُدِئَ فِيهِ بِالتَّكْبِيرِ قَبْلَ التَّسْبِيحِ وَالتَّهْلِيلِ وَالتَّحْمِيدِ قِيلَ لأنَّهُ أَرَادَ أَنْ يَبْدَأَ بِذِكْرِهِ وَاسْمِهِ لانَّ اسْمَ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى فِي التَّكْبِيرِ فِي أَوَّلِ الْحَرْفِ وَفِي التَّسْبِيحِ وَالتَّهْلِيلِ وَالتَّحْمِيدِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ فِي آخِرِ الْحَرْفِ فَبُدِئَ بِالْحَرْفِ الَّذِي اسْمُ اللَّهِ فِي أَوَّلِهِ لا فِي آخِرِهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ مَثْنَى مَثْنَى قِيلَ لانْ يَكُونَ مُكَرَّراً فِي آذَانِ الْمُسْتَمِعِينَ مُؤَكَّداً عَلَيْهِمْ إِنْ سَهَا أَحَدٌ عَنِ الأَوَّلِ لَمْ يَسْهُ عَنِ الثَّانِي وَلانَّ الصَّلاةَ رَكْعَتَانِ رَكْعَتَانِ فَلِذَلِكَ جُعِلَ الأَذَانُ مَثْنَى مَثْنَى.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ التَّكْبِيرُ فِي أَوَّلِ الأَذَانِ أَرْبَعاً قِيلَ لانَّ أَوَّلَ الأَذَانِ إِنَّمَا يَبْدُو [يُبْدَأُ] غَفْلَةً وَلَيْسَ قَبْلَهُ كَلامٌ يَتَنَبَّهُ الْمُسْتَمِعُ لَهُ فَجُعِلَ ذَلِكَ تَنْبِيهاً لِلْمُسْتَمِعِينَ لِمَا بَعْدَهُ فِي الأَذَانِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جَعَلَ بَعْدَ التَّكْبِيرِ شَهَادَتَيْنِ قِيلَ لانَّ أَوَّلَ الإِيمَانِ التَّوْحِيدُ وَالإِقْرَارُ بِاللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ بِالْوَحْدَانِيَّةِ وَالثَّانِيَ الإِقْرَارُ بِالرَّسُولِ بِالرِّسَالَةِ وَأَنَّ طَاعَتَهُمَاوَمَعْرِفَتَهُمَا مَقْرُونَتَانِ وَأَنَّ أَصْلَ الإِيمَانِ إِنَّمَا هُوَالشَّهَادَةُ فَجَعَلَ شَهَادَتَيْنِ فِي الأَذَانِ كَمَا جَعَلَ فِي سَائِرِ الْحُقُوقِ شَهَادَتَيْنِ فَإِذَا أُقِرَّ لِلَّهِ بِالْوَحْدَانِيَّةِ وَأُقِرَّ لِلرَّسُولِ بِالرِّسَالَةِ فَقَدْ أُقِرَّ بِجُمْلَةِ الإِيمَانِ لانَّ أَصْلَ الإِيمَانِ إِنَّمَا هُوَالإِقْرَارُ بِاللَّهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ بَعْدَ الشَّهَادَتَيْنِ الدُّعَاءُ إِلَى الصَّلاةِ قِيلَ لانَّ الأَذَانَ إِنَّمَا وُضِعَ لِمَوْضِعِ الصَّلاةِ وَإِنَّمَا هُوَنِدَاءٌ إِلَى الصَّلاةِ فَجُعِلَ النِّدَاءُ إِلَى الصَّلاةِ فِي وَسَطِ الأَذَانِ فَقَدَّمَ الْمُؤَذِّنُ قَبْلَهَا أَرْبَعاً التَّكْبِيرَتَيْنِ وَالشَّهَادَتَيْنِ وَأَخَّرَ بَعْدَهَا أَرْبَعاً يَدْعُو إِلَى الْفَلاحِ حَثّاً عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالصَّلاةِ ثُمَّ دَعَا إِلَى خَيْرِ الْعَمَلِ مُرَغِّباً فِيهَا وَفِي عَمَلِهَا وَفِي أَدَائِهَا ثُمَّ نَادَى بِالتَّكْبِيرِ وَالتَّهْلِيلِ لِيُتِمَّ بَعْدَهَا أَرْبَعاً كَمَا أَتَمَّ قَبْلَهَا أَرْبَعاً وَلِيَخْتِمَ كَلامَهُ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى كَمَا فَتَحَهُ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ آخِرُهَا التَّهْلِيلَ وَلَمْ يُجْعَلْ آخِرُهَا التَّكْبِيرَ كَمَا جُعِلَ فِي أَوَّلِهَا التَّكْبِيرُ.قِيلَ لانَّ التَّهْلِيلَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ فِي آخِرِهِ فَأَحَبَّ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى أَنْ يَخْتِمَ الْكَلامَ بِاسْمِهِ كَمَا فَتَحَهُ بِاسْمِهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ لَمْ يُجْعَلْ بَدَلَ التَّهْلِيلِ التَّسْبِيحُ أَوِ التَّحْمِيدُ وَاسْمُ اللَّهِ فِي آخِرِهِمَا قِيلَ لانَّ التَّهْلِيلَ هُوَإِقْرَارٌ لِلَّهِ تَعَالَى بِالتَّوْحِيدِ وَخَلْعِ الأَنْدَادِ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَهُوَأَوَّلُ الإِيمَانِ وَأَعْظَمُ التَّسْبِيحِ وَالتَّحْمِيدِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ بُدِئَ فِي الاسْتِفْتَاحِ وَالرُّكُوعِ وَالسُّجُودِ وَالْقِيَامِ وَالْقُعُودِ بِالتَّكْبِيرِ قِيلَ لِلْعِلَّةِ الَّتِي ذَكَرْنَاهَا فِي الأَذَانِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جَعَلَ الدُّعَاءَ فِي الرَّكْعَةِ الأُولَى قَبْلَ الْقِرَاءَةِ وَلِمَ جَعَلَ فِي الرَّكْعَةِ الثَّانِيَةِ الْقُنُوتَ بَعْدَ الْقِرَاءَةِ قِيلَ لانَّهُ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يَفْتَحَ قِيَامَهُ لِرَبِّهِ وَعِبَادَتَهُ بِالتَّحْمِيدِ وَالتَّقْدِيسِ وَالرَّغْبَةِ وَالرَّهْبَةِ وَيَخْتِمَهُ بِمِثْلِ ذَلِكَ لِيَكُونَ فِي الْقِيَامِ عِنْدَ الْقُنُوتِ طُولٌ فَأَحْرَى أَنْ يُدْرِكَ الْمُدْرِكُ الرُّكُوعَ فَلا تَفُوتَهُ الرَّكْعَةُ فِي الْجَمَاعَةِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِالْقِرَاءَةِ فِي الصَّلاةِ قِيلَ لِئَلا يَكُونَ الْقُرْآنُ مَهْجُوراً مُضَيَّعاً وَلِيَكُونَ مَحْفُوظاً فَلا يَضْمَحِلَّ وَلا يُجْهَلَ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ بُدِئَ بِالْحَمْدِ فِي كُلِّ قِرَاءَةٍ دُونَ سَائِرِ السُّوَرِ قِيلَ لأنَّهُ لَيْسَ شَيْ‏ءٌ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ وَالْكَلامِ جُمِعَ فِيهِ مِنْ جَـوَامِعِ الْخَيْرِ وَالْحِـكْمَةِ مَـا جُمِعَ فِي سُورَةِ الْحَمْدِ وَذَلِكَ أَنَّ قَوْلَهُ(الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ) إِنَّمَا هُوَ أَدَاءٌ لِمَا أَوْجَبَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى

تَصِيرَ رَكَعَاتُ الصَّلاةِ فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَةِ فَرْداً ثُمَّ تَرَكَ الْغَدَاةَ عَلَى حَالِهَا لانَّ الاشْتِغَالَ فِي وَقْتِهَا أَكْثَرُ وَالْمُبَادَرَةَ إِلَى الْحَوَائِجِ فِيهَا أَعَمُّ وَلانَّ الْقُلُوبَ فِيهَا أَخْلَى مِنَ الْفِكْرِ لِقِلَّةِ مُعَامَلاتِ النَّاسِ بِاللَّيْلِ وَلِقِلَّةِ الأَخْذِ وَالإِعْطَاءِ فَالإِنْسَانُ فِيهَا أَقْبَلُ عَلَى صَلاتِهِ مِنْهُ فِي غَيْرِهَا مِنَ الصَّلَوَاتِ لانَّ الْفِكْرَ أَقَلُّ لِعَدَمِ الْعَمَلِ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ التَّكْبِيرُ فِي الاسْتِفْتَاحِ سَبْعَ مَرَّاتٍ قِيلَ إِنَّمَا جُعِلَ ذَلِكَ لانَّ التَّكْبِيرَ فِي الرَّكْعَةِ الأُولَى الَّتِي هِيَ الأَصْلُ كُلَّهُ سَبْعُ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ تَكْبِيرَةِ الاسْتِفْتَاحِ وَتَكْبِيرَةِ الرُّكُوعِ وَتَكْبِيرَتَيِ السُّجُودِ وَتَكْبِيرَةٍ أَيْضاً لِلرُّكُوعِ وَتَكْبِيرَتَيْنِ لِلسُّجُودِ فَإِذَا كَبَّرَ الإِنْسَانُ أَوَّلَ الصَّلاةِ سَبْعَ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ فَقَدْ أَحْرَزَ التَّكْبِيرَ كُلَّهُ فَإِنْ سَهَا فِي شَيْ‏ءٍ مِنْهَا أَوْ تَرَكَهَا لَمْ يَدْخُلْ عَلَيْهِ نَقْصٌ فِي صَلاتِهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جَعَلَ رَكْعَةً وَسَجْدَتَيْنِ قِيلَ لانَّ الرُّكُوعَ مِنْ فِعْلِ الْقِيَامِ وَالسُّجُودَ مِنْ فِعْلِ الْقُعُودِ وَصَلاةَ الْقَاعِدِ عَلَى النِّصْفِ مِنْ صَلاةِ الْقِيَامِ فَضُوعِفَ السُّجُودُ لِيَسْتَوِيَ بِالرُّكُوعِ فَلا يَكُونَ بَيْنَهُمَا تَفَاوُتٌ لانَّ الصَّلاةَ إِنَّمَا هِيَ رُكُوعٌ وَسُجُودٌ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ التَّشَهُّدُ بَعْدَ الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ قِيلَ لانَّهُ كَمَا قُدِّمَ قَبْلَ الرُّكُوعِ وَالسُّجُودِ الأَذَانُ وَالدُّعَاءُ وَالْقِرَاءَةُ فَكَذَلِكَ أَيْضاً أُمِرَ بَعْدَهَا بِالتَّشَهُّدِ وَالتَّحْمِيدِ وَالدُّعَاءِ.فَإِنْ

فَلِمَ جُعِلَ الْجَهْرُ فِي بَعْضِ الصَّلاةِ وَلَمْ يُجْعَلْ فِي بَعْضٍ قِيلَ لانَّ الصَّلَوَاتِ الَّتِي يُجْهَرُ فِيهَا إِنَّمَا هِيَ صَلَوَاتٌ تُصَلَّى فِي أَوْقَاتٍ مُظْلِمَةٍ فَوَجَبَ أَنْ يُجْهَرَ فِيهَا لانْ يَمُرَّ الْمَارُّ فَيَعْلَمَ أَنَّ هَاهُنَا جَمَاعَةً فَإِنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُصَلِّيَ صَلَّى وَلانَّهُ إِنْ لَمْ يَرَ جَمَاعَةً تُصَلِّي سَمِعَ وَعَلِمَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ جِهَةِ السَّمَاعِ وَالصَّلاتَانِ اللَّتَانِ لا يُجْهَرُ فِيهِمَا فَإِنَّهُمَا بِالنَّهَارِ وَفِي أَوْقَاتٍ مُضِيئَةٍ فَهِيَ تُدْرَكُ مِنْ جِهَةِ الرُّؤْيَةِ فَلا يَحْتَاجُ فِيهَا إِلَى السَّمَاعِ.فَإِنْ

وَفَرَغُوا مِمَّا كَانُوا بِهِ مُشْتَغِلِينَ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يَبْدَءُوا أَوَّلاً بِعِبَادَتِهِ وَطَاعَتِهِ ثُمَّ يَصِيرُونَ إِلَى مَا شَاءُوا أَنْ يَصِيرُوا إِلَيْهِ مِنْ ذَلِكَ فَيَكُونُوا قَدْ بَدَءُوا فِي كُلِّ عَمَلٍ بِطَاعَتِهِ وَعِبَادَتِهِ فَأَوْجَبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعَتَمَةَ فَإِذَا فَعَلُوا ذَلِكَ لَمْ يَنْسَوْهُ وَلَمْ يَغْفُلُوا عَنْهُ وَلَمْ تَقْسُ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَلَمْ تَقِلَّ رَغْبَتُهُمْ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ إِذَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لِلْعَصْرِ وَقْتٌ مَشْهُورٌ مِثْلُ تِلْكَ الأَوْقَاتِ أَوْجَبَهَا بَيْنَ الظُّهْرِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَمْ يُوجِبْهَا بَيْنَ الْعَتَمَةِ وَالْغَدَاةِ أَوْ بَيْنَ الْغَدَاةِ وَالظُّهْرِ قِيلَ لانَّهُ لَيْسَ وَقْتٌ عَلَى النَّاسِ أَخَفَّ وَلا أَيْسَرَ وَلا أَحْرَى أَنْ يَعُمَّ فِيهِ الضَّعِيفَ وَالْقَوِيَّ بِهَذِهِ الصَّلاةِ مِنْ هَذَا الْوَقْتِ وَذَلِكَ أَنَّ النَّاسَ عَامَّتَهُمْ يَشْتَغِلُونَ فِي أَوَّلِ النَّهَارِ بِالتِّجَارَاتِ وَالْمُعَامَلاتِ وَالذَّهَابِ فِي الْحَوَائِجِ وَإِقَامَةِ الأَسْوَاقِ فَأَرَادَ أَنْ لا يَشْغَلَهُمْ عَنْ

بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْر.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ يُرْفَعُ الْيَدَانِ فِي التَّكْبِيرِ قِيلَ لانَّ رَفْعَ الْيَدَيْنِ هُوَضَرْبٌ مِنَ الابْتِهَالِ وَالتَّبَتُّلِ وَالتَّضَرُّعِ فَأَوْجَبَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنْ يَكُونَ الْعَبْدُ فِي وَقْتِ ذِكْرِهِ مُتَبَتِّلاً مُتَضَرِّعاً مُبْتَهِلاً وَلانَّ فِي وَقْتِ رَفْعِ الْيَدَيْنِ إِحْضَارَ النِّيَّةِ وَإِقْبَالَ الْقَلْبِ عَلَى مَا قَالَ وَقَصَدَ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ صَلاةُ السُّنَّةِ أَرْبَعاً وَثَلاثِينَ رَكْعَةً قِيلَ لانَّ الْفَرِيضَةَ سَبْعَ عَشْرَةَ رَكْعَةً فَجُعِلَتِ السُّنَّةُ مِثْلَيِ الْفَرِيضَةِ كَمَالاً لِلْفَرِيضَةِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ صَلاةُ السُّنَّةِ فِي أَوْقَاتٍ مُخْتَلِفَةٍ وَلَمْ تُجْعَلْ فِي وَقْتٍ وَاحِدٍ قِيلَ لانَّ أَفْضَلَ الأَوْقَاتِ ثَلاثَةٌ عِنْدَ زَوَالِ الشَّمْسِ وَبَعْدَ الْمَغْرِبِ وَبِالأَسْحَارِ فَأَحَبَّ أَنْ يُصَلَّى لَهُ فِي كُلِّ هَذِهِ الأَوْقَاتِ الثَّلاثَةِ لانَّهُ إِذَا فُرِّقَتِ السُّنَّةُ فِي أَوْقَاتٍ شَتَّى كَانَ أَدَاؤُهَا أَيْسَرَ وَأَخَفَّ مِنْ أَنْ تُجْمَعَ كُلُّهَا فِي وَقْتٍ وَاحِدٍ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ صَارَتْ صَلاةُ الْجُمُعَةِ إِذَا كَانَتْ مَعَ الإِمَامِ رَكْعَتَيْنِ وَإِذَا كَانَتْ بِغَيْرِ إِمَامٍ رَكْعَتَيْنِ وَرَكْعَتَيْنِ قِيلَ لِعِلَلٍ شَتَّى مِنْهَا أَنَّ النَّاسَ يَتَخَطَّوْنَ إِلَى الْجُمُعَةِ مِنْ بُعْدٍ فَأَحَبَّ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنْ يُخَفِّفَ عَنْهُمْ لِمَوْضِعِ التَّعَبِ الَّذِي صَارُوا إِلَيْهِ.وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الإِمَامَ يَحْبِسُهُمْ لِلْخُطْبَةِ وَهُمْ مُنْتَظِرُونَ لِلصَّلاةِ وَمَنِ انْتَظَرَ الصَّلاةَ فَهُوَفِي صَلاةٍ فِي حُكْمِ الَّتمَامِ.وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الصَّلاةَ مَعَ الإِمَامِ أَتَمُّ وَأَكْمَلُ لِعِلْمِهِ وَفِقْهِهِ وَعَدْلِهِ وَفَضْلِهِ وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الْجُمُعَةَ عِيدٌ وَصَلاةَ الْعِيدِ رَكْعَتَانِ وَلَمْ تُقْصَرْ لِمَكَانِ الْخُطْبَتَيْنِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتِ الْخُطْبَةُ قِيلَ لانَّ الْجُمُعَةَ مَشْهَدٌ عَامٌّ فَأَرَادَ أَنْ يَكُونَ الإِمَامُ سَبَباً لِمَوْعِظَتِهِمْ وَتَرْغِيبِهِمْ فِي الطَّاعَةِ وَتَرْهِيبِهِمْ مِن الْمَعْصِيَةِ وَتَوْفِيقِهِمْ عَلَى مَا أَرَادَ مِنْ

قِيلَ لانْ يَكُونَ وَاحِدَةٌ لِلثَّنَاءِ وَالَّتمْجِيدِ وَالتَّقْدِيسِ لِلَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَالأُخْرَى لِلْحَوَائِجِ وَالإِعْذَارِ وَالإِنْذَارِ وَالدُّعَاءِ وَمَا يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُعَلِّمَهُمْ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ وَنَهْيِهِ مَا فِيهِ الصَّلاحُ وَالْفَسَادُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتِ الْخُطْبَةُ يَوْمَ الْجُمُعَةِ قَبْلَ الصَّلاةِ وَجُعِلَتْ فِي الْعِيدَيْنِ بَعْدَ الصَّلاةِ قِيلَ لانَّ الْجُمُعَةَ أَمْرٌ دَائِمٌ وَتَكُونُ فِي الشَّهْرِ مِرَاراً وَفِي السَّنَةِ كَثِيراً فَإِذَا كَثُرَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى النَّاسِ مَلُّوا وَتَرَكُوا وَلَمْ يُقِيمُوا عَلَيْهِ وَتَفَرَّقُوا عَنْهُ فَجُعِلَتْ قَبْلَ الصَّلاةِ لِيُحْتَبَسُوا عَلَى الصَّلاةِ وَلا يَتَفَرَّقُوا وَلا يَذْهَبُوا وَأَمَّا الْعِيدَيْنِ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَفِي السَّنَةِ مَرَّتَيْنِ وَهُوَأَعْظَمُ مِنَ الْجُمُعَةِ وَالزِّحَامُ فِيهِ أَكْثَرُ وَالنَّاسُ فِيهِ أَرْغَبُ فَإِنْ تَفَرَّقَ بَعْضُ النَّاسِ بَقِيَ عَامَّتُهُمْ وَلَيْسَ هُوَبِكَثِيرٍ فَيَمَلُّوا وَيَسْتَخِفُّوا بِهِ.قالَ مُصَنِّفُ هذا الْكِتاب‏رحمه الله: جاءَ هذا الخَبَرُ هكَذا وَالْخُطْبَتَانِ فِي الْجُمُعَةِ وَالْعِيدَيْنِ بَعْدَ الصَّلاةِ لانَّهُمَا بِمَنْزِلَةِ الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ الأُخْرَاوَيْنِ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ قَدَّمَ الْخُطْبَتَيْنِ عُثَْمـانُ بْنُ عَفَّـانَلأنَّهُ لَمَّا أَحْدَثَ مَا أَحْدَثَ لَمْ يَكُنِ النَّاسُ يَقِفُونَ عَلَى خُطْبَتِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ: مَا نَصْنَعُ بِمَوَاعِظِهِ وَقَدْ أَحْدَثَ مَا أَحْدَثَ فَقَدَّمَ الْخُطْبَتَيْنِ لِيَقِفَ النَّاسُ انْتِظَاراً لِلصَّلاةِ فَلا يَتَفَرَّقُوا عَنْهُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ وَجَبَتِ الْجُمُعَةُ عَلَى مَنْ يَكُونُ عَلَى فَرْسَخَيْنِ لا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ ذَلِك؟ قِيلَ لانَّ مَا يُقَصَّرُ فِيهِ الصَّلاةُ بَرِيدَانِ ذَاهِباً أَوْ بَرِيدٌ ذَاهِباً وَجَائِياً وَالْبَرِيدُ أَرْبَعَةُ فَرَاسِخَ فَوَجَبَتِ الْجُمُعَةُ عَلَى مَنْ هُوَعَلَى نِصْفِ الْبَرِيدِ الَّذِي يَجِبُ فِيهِ التَّقْصِيرُ وَذَلِكَ أَنَّهُ يَجِي‏ءُ فَرْسَخَيْنِ وَيَذْهَبُ فَرْسَخَيْنِ فَذَلِكَ أَرْبَعَةُ فَرَاسِخَ وَهُوَنِصْفُ طَرِيقِ الْمُسَافِرِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ زِيدَ فِي صَلاةِ السُّنَّةِ يَوْمَ الْجُمُعَةِ أَرْبَعُ رَكَعَاتٍ قِيلَ تَعْظِيماً لِذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَتَفْرِقَةً بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ سَائِرِ الأَيَّامِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ قُصِّرَتِ الصَّلاةُ فِي السَّفَرِ قِيلَ لانَّ الصَّلاةَ الْمَفْرُوضَةَ أَوَّلاً إِنَّمَا هِيَ عَشْرُ رَكَعَاتٍ وَالسَّبْعُ إِنَّمَا زِيدَتْ فِيهَا بَعْدُ فَخَفَّفَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ تِلْكَ الزِّيَادَةَ لِمَوْضِعِ سَفَرِهِ وَتَعَبِهِ وَنَصَبِهِ وَاشْتِغَالِهِ بِأَمْرِ نَفْسِهِ وَظَعْنِهِ وَإِقَامَتِهِ لِئَلا يَشْتَغِلَ عَمَّا لا بُدَّ لَهُ مِنْ مَعِيشَتِهِ رَحْمَةً مِنَ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى وَتَعَطُّفاً عَلَيْهِ إِلا صَلاةَ الْمَغْرِبِ فَإِنَّهَا لَمْ تُقَصَّرْ لانَّهَا صَلاةٌ مُقَصَّرَةٌ فِي الأَصْلِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ يَجِبُ التَّقْصِيرُ فِي ثَمَانِيَةِ فَرَاسِخَ لا أَقَلَّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَلا أَكْثَرَ.قِيلَ لانَّ ثَمَانِيَةَ فَرَاسِخَ مَسِيرَةُ يَوْمٍ لِلْعَامَّةِ وَالْقَوَافِلِ وَالأَثْقَالِ فَوَجَبَ التَّقْصِيرُ فِي مَسِيرَةِ يَوْمٍ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ وَجَبَ التَّقْصِيرُ فِي مَسِيرَةِ يَوْمٍ قِيلَ لانَّهُ لَوْ لَمْ يَجِبْ فِي مَسِيرَةِ يَوْمٍ لَمَا وَجَبَ فِي مَسِيرَةِ سَنَةٍ وَذَلِكَ أَنَّ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ يَكُونُ بَعْدَ هَذَا الْيَوْمِ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَنَظِيرُ هَذَا الْيَوْمِ فَلَوْ لَمْ يَجِبْ فِي هَذَا الْيَوْمِ لَمَا وَجَبَ فِي نَظِيرِهِ إِذَا كَانَ نَظِيرُهُ مِثْلَهُ لا فَرْقَ بَيْنَهُمَا.فَإِنْ قَالَ قَدْ يَخْتَلِفُ السَّيْرُ فَلِمَ جَعَلْتَ أَنْتَ مَسِيرَةَ يَوْمٍ ثَمَانِيَةَ فَرَاسِخَ قِيلَ لانَّ ثَمَانِيَةَ فَرَاسِخَ هِيَ مَسِيرُ الْجِمَالِ وَالْقَوَافِلِ وَهُوَالسَّيْرُ الَّذِي يَسِيرُهُ الْجَمَّالُونَ وَالْمُكَارُون.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ تُرِكَ تَطَوُّعُ النَّهَارِ وَلا يُتْرَكُ تَطَوُّعُ اللَّيْلِ قِيلَ لانَّ كُلَّ صَلاةٍ لا تَقْصِيرَ فِيهَا فَلا تَقْصِيرَ فِي تَطَوُّعِهَا وَذَلِكَ أَنَّ الْمَغْرِبَ لا تَقْصِيرَ فِيهَا فَلا تَقْصِيرَ فِيَما بَعْدَهَا مِنَ التَّطَوُّعِ وَكَذَلِكَ الْغَدَاةُ لا تَقْصِيرَ فِيَما قَبْلَهَا مِنَ التَّطَوُّعِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْعَتَمَةِ مُقَصَّرَةٌ وَلَيْسَ تُتْرَكُ رَكْعَتَاهَا قِيلَ إِنَّ تِلْكَ الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ لَيْسَتَا مِنَ الْخَمْسِينَ وَإِنَّمَا هِيَ زِيَادَةٌ فِي الْخَمْسِينَ تَطَوُّعاً لِيُتِمَّ بِهَا بَدَلَ كُلِّ رَكْعَةٍ مِنَ الْفَرِيضَةِ رَكْعَتَيْنِ مِنَ التطوّع.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جَازَ لِلْمُسَافِرِ وَالْمَرِيضِ أَنْ يُصَلِّيَا صَلاةَ اللَّيْلِ فِي أَوَّلِ اللَّيْلِ قِيلَ لاشْتِغَالِهِوَضَعْفِهِ لِيُحْرِزَ صَلاتَهُ فَيَسْتَرِيحَ الْمَرِيضُ فِي وَقْتِ رَاحَتِهِ وَيَشْتَغِلَ الْمُسَافِرُ بِأَشْغَالِهِ وَارْتِحَالِهِ وَسَفَرِهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِالصَّلاةِ عَلَى الْمَيِّتِ قِيلَ لِيَشْفَعُوا لَهُ وَيَدْعُوا لَهُ بِالْمَغْفِرَةِ لانَّهُ لَمْ يَكُنْ فِي وَقْتٍ مِنَ الأَوْقَاتِ أَحْوَجَ إِلَى الشَّفَاعَةِ فِيهِ وَالطَّلَبِ وَالاسْتِغْفَارِ مِنْ تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتْ خَمْسُ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ دُونَ أَنْ يُكَبَّرَ أَرْبَعاً أَوْ سِتّاً قِيلَ إِنَّ الْخَمْسَ إِنَّمَا أُخِذَتْ مِنَ الْخَمْسِ الصَّلَوَاتِ فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَةِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ لَمْ يَكُنْ فِيهَا رُكُوعٌ وَسُجُودٌ قِيلَ لانَّهُ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ بِهَذِهِ الصَّلاةِ الشَّفَاعَةَ لِهَذَا الْعَبْدِ الَّذِي قَدْ تَخَلَّى مِمَّا خَلَّفَ وَاحْتَاجَ إِلَى مَا قَدَّم.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرَ بِغُسْلِ الْمَيِّتِ قِيلَ لانَّهُ إِذَا مَاتَ كَانَ الْغَالِبُ عَلَيْهِ النَّجَاسَةَ وَالآْفَةَ وَالأَذَى فَأَحَبَّ أَنْ يَكُونَ طَاهِراً إِذَا بَاشَرَ أَهْلَ الطَّهَارَةِ مِنَ الْمَلائِكَةِ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُ وَيُمَاسُّونَهُ فِيَما بَيْنَهُمْ نَظِيفاً مُوَجَّهاً بِهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَلَيْسَ مِنْ مَيِّتٍ يَمُوتُ إِلا خَرَجَتْ مِنْهُ الْجَنَابَةُ فَلِذَلِكَ أَيْضاً وَجَبَ الْغُسْلُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِكَفْنِ الْمَيِّتِ قِيلَ لِيَلْقَى رَبَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ طَاهِرَ الْجَسَدِ وَلِئَلا تَبْدُوَ عَوْرَتُهُلِمَنْ يَحْمِلُهُ وَيَدْفِنُهُ وَلِئَلا يَظْهَرَ النَّاسُ عَلَى بَعْضِ حَالِهِ وَقُبْحِ مَنْظَرِهِ وَلِئَلا يَقْسُوَالْقَلْبُ مِنْ كَثْرَةِ النَّظَرِ إِلَى مِثْلِ ذَلِكَ لِلْعَاهَةِ وَالْفَسَادِ وَلِيَكُونَ أَطْيَبَ لانْفُسِ الأَحْيَاءِ وَلِئَلا يُبْغِضَهُ حَمِيمٌ فَيُلْقِيَ ذِكْرَهُ وَمَوَدَّتَهُ فَلا يَحْفَظَهُ فِيَما خَلَّفَ وَأَوْصَاهُ وَأَمَرَ بِهِ وَاجباً كان او ندباً.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِدَفْنِهِ قِيلَ لِئَلا يَظْهَرَ النَّاسُ عَلَى فَسَادِ جَسَدِهِ وَقُبْحِ مَنْظَرِهِ وَتَغَيُّرِ رِيحِهِ وَلا يَتَأَذَّى بِهِ الأَحْيَاءُ بِرِيحِهِ وَبِمَا يَدْخُلُ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الآْفَةِ وَالْفَسَادِ وَلِيَكُونَ مَسْتُوراً عَنِ الأَوْلِيَاءِ وَالأَعْدَاءِ فَلا يَشْمَتَ عَدُوٌّ وَلا يَحْزَنَ صِدِّيقٌ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرَ مَنْ يَغْسِلُهُ بِالْغُسْلِ قِيلَ لِعِلَّةِ الطَّهَارَةِ مِمَّا أَصَابَهُ مِنْ نَضْحِ الْمَيِّتِ لانَّ الْمَيِّتَ إِذَا خَرَجَ مِنْهُ الرُّوحُ بَقِيَ مِنْهُ أَكْثَرُ آفَتِهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ لَمْ يَجِبِ الْغُسْلُ عَلَى مَنْ مَسَّ شَيْئاً مِنَ الأَمْوَاتِ غَيْرِ الإِنْسَانِ كَالطَّيْرِ وَالْبَهَائِمِ وَالسِّبَاعِ وَغَيْرِ ذَلِكَ قِيلَ لانَّ هَذِهِ الأَشْيَاءَ كُلَّهَا مُلَبَّسَةٌ رِيشاً وَصُوفاً وَشَعَراً وَوَبَراً وَهَذَا كُلُّهُ ذَكِيٌّ وَلا يَمُوتُ وَإِنَّمَا يُمَاسُّ مِنْهُ الشَّيْ‏ءُ الَّذِي هُوَذَكِيٌّ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَالْمَيِّتِ. فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جَوَّزْتُمُ الصَّلاةَ عَلَى الْمَيِّتِ بِغَيْرِ وُضُوءٍ قِيلَ لانَّهُ لَيْسَ فِيهَا رُكُوعٌ وَلا سُجُودٌ وَإِنَّمَا هِيَ دُعَاءٌ وَمَسْأَلَةٌ وَقَدْ يَجُوزُ أَنْ تَدْعُوَاللَّهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَتَسْأَلَهُ عَلَى أَيِّ حَالٍ كُنْتَ وَإِنَّمَا يَجِبُ الْوُضُوءُ فِي الصَّلاةِ الَّتِي فِيهَا رُكُوعٌ وَسُجُودٌ. فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جَوَّزْتُمُ الصَّلاةَ عَلَيْهِ قَبْلَ الْمَغْرِبِ وَبَعْدَ الْفَجْرِ.قِيلَ لانَّ هَذِهِ الصَّلاةَ إِنَّمَا تَجِبُ فِي وَقْتِ الْحُضُورِ وَالْعِلَّةِ وَلَيْسَتْ هِيَ مُوَقَّتَةً كَسَائِرِ الصَّلَوَاتِ وَإِنَّمَا هِيَ صَلاةٌ تَجِبُ فِي وَقْتِ حُدُوثِ الْحَدَثِ لَيْسَ لِلإِنْسَانِ فِيهِ اخْتِيَارٌ وَإِنَّمَا هُوَحَقٌّ يُؤَدَّى وَجَائِزٌ أَنْ يُؤَدَّى الْحُقُوقُ فِي أَيِّ وَقْتٍ كَانَ إِذَا لَمْ يَكُنِ الْحَقُّ مُوَقَّتاً.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتْ لِلْكُسُوفِ صَلاةٌ قِيلَ لانَّهُ آيَةٌ مِنْ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لا يُدْرَى أَلِرَحْمَةٍ ظَهَرَتْ أَمْ لِعَذَابٍ فَأَحَبَّ النَّبِيُ‏ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ أَنْ تَفْزَعَ أُمَّتُهُ إِلَى خَالِقِهَا وَرَاحِمِهَا عِنْدَ ذَلِكَ لِيَصْرِفَ عَنْهُمْ شَرَّهَا وَيَقِيَهُمْ مَكْرُوهَهَا كَمَا صَرَفَ عَنْ قَوْمِ يُونُسَ حِينَ تَضَرَّعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتْ عَشْرَ رَكَعَاتٍ قِيلَ لانَّ الصَّلاةَ الَّتِي نَزَلَ فَرْضُهَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الأَرْضِ أَوَّلاً فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَةِ فَإِنَّمَا هِيَ عَشْرُ رَكَعَاتٍ فَجُمِعَتْ تِلْكَ الرَّكَعَاتُ هَاهُنَا وَإِنَّمَا جُعِلَ فِيهَا السُّجُودُ لانَّهُ لا يَكُونُ صَلاةٌ فِيهَا رُكُوعٌ إِلا وَفِيهَا سُجُودٌ وَلانْ يَخْتِمُوا صَلاتَهُمْ أَيْضاً بِالسُّجُودِ وَالْخُضُوعِ وَإِنَّمَا جُعِلَتْ أَرْبَعَ سَجَدَاتٍ لانَّ كُلَّ صَلاةٍ نَقَصَ سُجُودُهَا مِنْ أَرْبَعِ سَجَدَاتٍ لا تَكُونُ صَلاةً لانَّ أَقَلَّ الْفَرْضِ مِنَ السُّجُودِ فِي الصَّلاةِ لا يَكُونُ إِلا عَلَى أَرْبَعِ سَجَدَاتٍ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ لَمْ يُجْعَلْ بَدَلُ الرُّكُوعِ سُجُوداً قِيلَ لانَّ الصَّلاةَ قَائِماً أَفْضَلُ مِنَ الصَّلاةِ قَاعِداً وَلانَّ الْقَائِمَ يَرَى الْكُسُوفَ وَالانْجِلاءَ وَالسَّاجِدُ لا يَرَى.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ غُيِّرَتْ عَنْ أَصْلِ الصَّلاةِ الَّتِي افْتَرَضَهَا اللَّهُ قِيلَ لانَّهُ صَلَّى لِعِلَّة تَغَيُّرِ أَمْرٍ مِنَ الأُمُورِ وَهُوَالْكُسُوفُ فَلَمَّا تَغَيَّرَتِ الْعِلَّةُ تَغَيَّرَ الْمَعْلُولُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ يَوْمُ الْفِطْرِ الْعِيدَ قِيلَ لانْ يَكُونَ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ مَجْمَعاً يَجْتَمِعُونَ فِيهِ وَيَبْرُزُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فَيَحْمَدُونَهُ عَلَى مَا مَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَكُونَ يَوْمَ عِيدٍ وَيَوْمَ اجْتَِماعٍ وَيَوْمَ فِطْرٍ وَيَوْمَ زَكَاةٍ وَيَوْمَ رَغْبَةٍ وَيَوْمَ تَضَرُّعٍ وَلانَّهُ أَوَّلُ يَوْمٍ مِنَ السَّنَةِ يَحِلُّ فِيهِ الأَكْلُ وَالشُّرْبُ لانَّ أَوَّلَ شُهُورِ السَّنَةِ عِنْدَ أَهْلِ الْحَقِّ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ فَأَحَبَّ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنْ يَكُونَ لَهُمْ فِي ذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ مَجْمَعٌ يَحْمَدُونَهُ فِيهِ وَيُقَدِّسُونَهُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ التَّكْبِيرُ فِيهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْهُ فِي غَيْرِهَا مِنَ الصَّلَوَاتِ قِيلَ لانَّ التَّكْبِيرَ إِنَّمَا هُوَتَعْظِيمٌ لِلَّهِ وَتَمْجِيدٌ عَلَى مَا هَدَى وَعَافَى كَمَا قَالَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا الْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا اللَّهَ عَلى‏ ما هَداكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ فِيهَا اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ تَكْبِيرَةً قِيلَ لانَّهُ يَكُونُ فِي رَكْعَتَيْنِ اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ تَكْبِيرَةً فَلِذَلِكَ جُعِلَ فِيهَا اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ تَكْبِيرَةً.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ سَبْعٌ فِي الأُولَى وَخَمْسٌ فِي الآْخِرَةِ وَلَمْ يُسَوَبَيْنَهُمَا قِيلَ لانَّ السُّنَّةَ فِي صَلاةِ الْفَرِيضَةِ أَنْ يُسْتَفْتَحَ بِسَبْعِ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ فَلِذَلِكَ بُدِئَ هَاهُنَا بِسَبْعِ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ وَجُعِلَ فِي الثَّانِيَةِ خَمْسُ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ لانَّ التَّحْرِيمَ مِنَ التَّكْبِيرِ فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَةِ خَمْسُ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ وَلِيَكُونَ التَّكْبِيرُ فِي الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ جَمِيعاً وَتْراً وَتْراً.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِالصَّوْمِ قِيلَ لِكَيْ يَعْرِفُوا أَلَمَ الْجُوعِ وَالْعَطَشِ فَيَسْتَدِلُّوا عَلَى فَقْرِ الآْخِرَةِ وَلِيَكُونَ الصَّائِمُ خَاشِعاً ذَلِيلاً مُسْتَكِيناً مَأْجُوراً مُحْتَسِباً عَارِفاً صَابِراً لِمَا أَصَابَهُ مِنَ الْجُوعِ وَالْعَطَشِ فَيَسْتَوْجِبَ الثَّوَابَ مَعَ مَا فِيهِ مِنَ الانْكِسَارِ عَنِ الشَّهَـوَاتِ وَلِيَكُونَ ذَلِـكَوَاعِظاً لَهُمْ فِي الْعَاجِلِ وَرَائِضاً لَهُمْ عَلَى أَدَاءِ مَا كَلَّفَهُمْ وَدَلِيلاً فِي الآْجِلِ وَلِيَعْرِفُوا شِدَّةَ مَبْلَغِ ذَلِكَ عَلَى أَهْلِ الْفَقْرِ وَالْمَسْكَنَةِ فِي الدُّنْيَا فَيُؤَدُّوا إِلَيْهِمْ مَا افْتَرَضَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى لَهُمْ فِي أَمْوَالِهِمْ.فَإِنْ قَالَ لِمَ جُعِلَ الصَّوْمُ فِي شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ خَاصَّةً دُونَ سَائِرِ الشُّهُورِ قِيلَ لانَّ شَهْرَ رَمَضَانَ هُوَالشَّهْرُ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى فِيهِ الْقُرْآنَ وَفِيهِ فَرَّقَ بَيْنَ الْحَقِّ وَالْبَاطِلِ كَمَا قَالَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى شَهْرُ رَمَضانَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدىً لِلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّناتٍ مِنَ الْهُدى‏ وَالْفُرْقانِ وَفِيهِ نُبِّىَ مُحَمَّدٌ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَفِيهِ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ الَّتِي هِيَ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ وَفِيها يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ وَهِيَ رَأْسُ السَّنَةِ يُقَدَّرُ فِيهَا مَا يَكُونُ فِي السَّنَةِ مِنْ خَيْرٍ أَوْ شَرٍّ أَوْ مَضَرَّةٍ أَوْ مَنْفَعَةٍ أَوْ رِزْقٍ أَوْ أَجَلٍ وَلِذَلِكَ سُمِّيَتْ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِصَوْمِ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ لا أَقَلَّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَلا أَكْثَرَ قِيلَ لانَّهُ قُوَّةُ الْعِبَادِ الَّتِي يُعَمُّ فِيهَا الْقَوِيُّ وَالضَّعِيفُ وَإِنَّمَا أَوْجَبَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى الْفَرَائِضَ عَلَى أَغْلَبِ الأَشْيَاءِ وَأَعَمِّ الْقُوَى ثُمَّ رَخَّصَ لاهْلِ الضَّعْفِ وَرَغَّبَ أَهْلَ الْقُوَّةِ فِي الْفَضْلِ وَلَوْ كَانُوا يَصْلُحُونَ عَلَى أَقَلَّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ لَنَقَصَهُمْ وَلَوِ احْتَاجُوا إِلَى أَكْثَرَ مِنْ ذَلِكَ لَزَادَهُمْ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ إِذَا حَاضَتِ الْمَرْأَةُ لا تَصُومُ وَلا تُصَلِّي قِيلَ لانَّهَا فِي حَدِّ النَّجَاسَةِ فَأَحَبَّ أَنْ لا تَعْبُدَ إِلا طَاهِراً وَلانَّهُ لا صَوْمَ لِمَنْ لا صَلاةَ لَهُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ صَارَتْ تَقْضِي الصِّيَامَ وَلا تَقْضِي الصَّلاةَ؟قِيلَ لِعِلَلٍ شَتَّى فَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الصِّيَامَ لا يَمْنَعُهَا مِنْ خِدْمَةِ نَفْسِهَا وَخِدْمَةِ زَوْجِهَا وَإِصْلاحِ بَيْتِهَا وَالْقِيَامِ بِأُمُورِهَا وَالاشْتِغَالِ بِمَرَمَّةِ مَعِيشَتِهَا وَالصَّلاةُ تَمْنَعُهَا مِنْ ذَلِكَ كُلِّهِ لانَّ الصَّلاةَ تَكُونُ فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَةِ مِرَاراً فَلا تَقْوَى عَلَى ذَلِكَ وَالصَّوْمُ لَيْسَ كَذَلِكَ وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الصَّلاةَ فِيهَا عَنَاءٌ وَتَعَبٌ وَاشْتِغَالُ الأَرْكَانِ وَلَيْسَ فِي الصَّوْمِ شَيْ‏ءٌ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَإِنَّمَا هُوَالإِمْسَاكُ عَنِ الطَّعَامِ وَالشَّرَابِ وَلَيْسَ فِيهِ اشْتِغَالُ الأَرْكَان‏وَمِنْهَا أَنَّهُ لَيْسَ مِنْ وَقْتٍ يَجِي‏ءُ إِلا تَجِبُ عَلَيْهَا فِيهِ صَلاةٌ جَدِيدَةٌ فِي يَوْمِهَا وَلَيْلَتِهَا وَلَيْسَ الصَّوْمُ كَذَلِكَ لانَّهُ لَيْسَ كُلَّمَا حَدَثَ يَوْمٌ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهَا الصَّوْمُ وَكُلَّمَا حَدَثَ وَقْتُ الصَّلاةِ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهَا الصَّلاةُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ إِذَا مَرِضَ الرَّجُلُ أَوْ سَافَرَ فِي شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ فَلَمْ يَخْرُجْ مِنْ سَفَرِهِ أَوْ لَمْ يُفِقْ مِنْ مَرَضِهِ حَتَّى يَدْخُلَ عَلَيْهِ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانٍ آخَرُ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْفِدَاءُ لِلأَوَّلِ وَسَقَطَ الْقَضَاءُ فَإِذَا أَفَاقَ بَيْنَهُمَا أَوْ أَقَامَ وَلَمْ يَقْضِهِ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْقَضَاءُ وَالْفِدَاءُ قِيلَ لانَّ ذَلِكَ الصَّوْمَ إِنَّمَا وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ فِي تِلْكَ السَّنَةِ فِي ذَلِكَ الشَّهْرِ فَأَمَّا الَّذِي لَمْ يُفِقْ فَإِنَّهُ لَمَّا أَنْ مَرَّ عَلَيْهِ السَّنَةُ كُلُّهَا وَقَدْ غَلَبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ فَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ لَهُ السَّبِيلَ إِلَى أَدَائِهِ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ وَكَذَلِكَ كُلُّ مَا غَلَبَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى عَلَيْهِ مِثْلَ الْمُغْمَى الَّذِي يُغْمَى عَلَيْهِ يَوْماً وَلَيْلَةً فَلا يَجِبُ عَلَيْهِ قَضَاءُ الصَّلاةِ كَمَا قَالَ الصَّادِقُ‏ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ كُلُّ مَا غَلَبَ اللَّهُ عَلَى الْعَبْدِ فَهُوَ أَعْذَرُ لَهُ لانَّهُ دَخَلَ الشَّهْرَ وَهُوَ مَرِيضٌ فَلَمْ يَجِبْ عَلَيْهِ الصَّوْمُ فِي

    "thaqalaynSanad": "34-1 In the (Arabic) month of Sha’ban of the year 352 A.H. (962 A.D.) Abdul Wahid Muhammad ibn Ubdoos al-Neishaboori al-At’tar - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Abul Hassan Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Qutayba al-Neishaboori quoted the following on the authority of Abu Muhammad Fadhl ibn Shathan al-Neishaboori. Moreover, al-Hakim Abu Muhammad Ja’far ibn Nu’aym ibn Shathan - may God have Mercy upon him - quoted on the authority of his uncle Abi Abdullah Muhammad ibn Shathan, on the authority of Fadhl ibn Shathan:",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "“ If someone asks, ‘Let me know if it is permissible for the Wise God to oblige His servants to do something without any reason or meaning.’He is told, ‘No. This is not permissible since He is Wise and He does not do frivolous or ignorant things. \u003Cbr\u003E ’And if he asks, ‘Let me know why God has made the people obliged (to do certain things)?’It is said, ‘For many reasons.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Let me know if the obligations are known and existing, or they are unknown and non-existent?’It is said, ‘Yes. They are known and are existent for their people.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Do you know them or not?’It is said, ‘There are some which I know of, and there are others which I do not know.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘What is the first obligation?’It is said, ‘To testify to God, His Messenger and His Proof, and whatever has come from the Honorable the Exalted God.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the creatures ordered to testify to God, His Messenger and His Proof, and whatever has come from the Honorable the Exalted God.’It is said, ‘For many reasons: One of them is that whoever does not testify to the Honorable the Exalted God would not avoid His disobedience, would not avoid committing major sins, and would not fear anyone regarding what his lust demands and enjoy corruption and oppression. Should the people commit these actions and should everyone act out of lust and selfish desires without fearing anyone, the result would be corruption for all the people. Some of them will attack others, rape women, steal goods, consider it fine to shed undue blood and commit adultery, and unrightfully kill others who have not committed any crimes. This would destroy the life of this world and corrupt the future generations. One of the reasons for this is that the Honorable the Exalted God is All-Wise and no one would be wise or described to be wise unless he admonishes against corruption and reprimands oppression. Such acts of admonishing against corruption and ordering to do what is right are not possible except after testifying to the Honorable the Exalted God and the recognition of the One who enjoins good and the One who admonishes. Were the people left without testifying to the Honorable the Exalted God and His recognition, enjoining to do right and admonishing against corruption, would not get established since there was no known enjoiner to do the right and admonished against corruption. We also know that there are some people who commit corruption in hiding away from public sight. Were it not for the sake of testifying to God and fearing Him in private, everyone would engage in lustful deeds in private without any fear of anyone. Knowing that no one is aware of what he does, one would go to the extreme in committing the forbidden deeds and major sins, since what he does is hidden from the people. This would lead to the destruction of all the people. Thus the stability and continuation of the people (generations) would not have been possible unless the people were asked to testify to the existence of the All-Knowing; the All-Aware (God) who knows what is hidden and what is deeply hidden; who enjoins to do right and forbids corruption and from whom nothing could remain hidden so as to prevent whatever form of corruption which they might engage in privately.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it incumbent upon the people to recognize the Messengers (a.s.), testify to them, and swear to obey them?’It is said, ‘Because man has not been equipped with the necessary powers in his own nature to be able to realize all that is best for him to do. Moreover, the Creator is High Exalted above that which is seen. The people are also weak and unable to recognize Him on the surface. Then a Messenger must be sent to be in between Him and them - an Immaculate one who delivers His Orders and Admonishments to them, to inform them about what would benefit them and what would fend off their losses. If it was not incumbent upon the people to get to recognize and obey Him, there would be no benefit in sending them any Messengers, and doing that would not have fulfilled any of their needs. It would even be that dispatching Messengers to them would be of no use to them. This is not amongst the characteristics of an All-Wise One who has created everything with a perfect order.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish some to be in charge of affairs and ordered us to obey them?’It is said, ‘For many reasons. One of them is for the people to know that there are some known limits and they are ordered not to transgress beyond these limits so that they will not become corrupt. This would not be implemented unless a trustworthy man is appointed to prevent them from transgressing and getting involved in what has been prohibited for them. Were this not the case, no one would abandon what fulfilled his lustful desires and brought him some gains - even if it corrupted others. Therefore, God appointed someone to be in charge of their (the people’s) affairs to carry out the Divine Decrees and Divine Chastisements amongst them and prevent them from getting corrupt.Another reason is that we know of no groups or nations who have survived living without someone in charge of them or leading them regarding their religious and worldly affairs. Thus it would not be deemed proper according to the wisdom of the All-Wise (God) to leave the people without one in charge of their affairs, while He knows that there is no other choice for them and they would not sustain without one. The people would fight their enemies, distribute national income, establish congregations and congregational prayers, and protect the oppressed from the oppressors under his (the leader’s) Divine Leadership.Another reason is that if He does not establish a trustworthy custodian for them, their nation would be totally destroyed, their religion would be lost, their traditions and decrees would change: innovators would add things to them and atheists would subtract things from them and make them dubious for the Muslims. We have found the oppressed and the needy to be imperfect and narrow-minded. Moreover, they have various levels of intellectual abilities, desires and varying opinions. Thus as we said before, they would all get corrupted if there was no one appointed to be in charge of their affairs to safeguard what the Messenger (a.s.) has brought to them from Him. Then the Divine Decrees, the traditions, the foundations of the religion and faith would all change. This would ultimately result in the corruption of all the people.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it not permissible for the existence of two or more Divine Leaders at the same time on the Earth?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that one leader would not have any conflicting actions or plans. However, if there were two, then their actions and plans would not conform with each other and they would not have the same opinion as so far we have not seen any two people who are in charge of an affair and not have different views on things, and different demands. Therefore, if there were two Divine Leaders with different wills, intentions and plans and it was obligatory to follow both of them, and the obedience of one was not superior to the obedience of the other, then there would certainly be differences among the people, and fighting and corruption would ensue. This would be because no one could obey one without disobeying the other. Then all the people of the Earth would be disobedient, and they would not have a path that would lead them towards obedience and faith. This problem would be rooted in their Creator who Himself has opened up the door of discord, fighting and corruption for them by ordering them to obey two leaders with opposite views.The other reason is that if there were two Divine Leaders, the people who are enemies of each other would each go to one side as they pleased and no one’s ruling over the other would be effective. This is so since they do not accept his ruling, and do not consider themselves obliged to obey him. They would not consider anyone more deserving than the other to rule. Thus all the Rights, Decrees and Divine Punishments would be nullified.Another reason is that neither of these two Proofs (of God or Leaders) would be superior to the other in speaking out, issuing decrees, enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong. And in these conditions they would both have to speak out. Neither one of them would deserve to surpass the other one in any issue, since they both have an equal rank in their religious leadership position. If one of them should remain silent, the other one must also remain silent. And if they both remain silent, again Rights, Decrees and Divine Punishments would be nullified. Then it would be as if the people do not have any Divine Leaders at all.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it not permissible for the Divine Leader to be from a family different from that of the Messenger of God?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that there should be a sign to clearly indicate the Divine Leader and distinguish him from others, since it is obligatory to obey him. That sign is his well-known ties of kinship (with the Prophet Muhammad (S)) and his clear appointment so that the people can distinguish him from others, and be clearly guided towards him.Another reason is that should the Divine Leader be one who is from a family different from that of the Messenger of God, then one who is not from the family of the Prophet (S) would become nobler than those from the family of the Prophet (S). In this way, the offspring of the Prophet (S) would become subject to the offspring of the Prophet’s (a.s.) enemies such as Abi Jahl or Ibn Abi Ma’eet: since they believed that if they have faith the Divine Leadership could be transferred from the Prophet’s (a.s.) offspring to the offspring of the enemies. Then this would result in the offspring of the Prophet (S) to be the subject and obedient ones, while the offspring of the enemies of God and His Messenger (a.s.) be the ones to be followed and obeyed. However, the Messenger (a.s.) is much nobler than others to be in charge, and he (a.s.) is the one who most deserves to be obeyed.Another reason is that once the people testify to the Prophethood of His Messenger (a.s.) and obey him, no one would hesitate to follow his offspring and obey them. This would not be hard for anyone. However, if the Divine Leader be one who is not from the Household of the Messenger of God (a.s.), everyone would consider himself to be more deserving for this position than others. Thus they would become so haughty that they would not obey him since they consider him to be less deserving of leadership than they themselves. Then this would cause corruption, discord and disunion amongst them.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it incumbent on the people to bear witness and know that there is One and Only One God?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that they would imagine there were two or more planners of the affairs (of the universe), if it was not incumbent upon them to do so. If this was allowed, then they could not recognize their true Creator from the others since each person could not tell which of the two or more is the Creator and might obey one who is not really his Creator. No one could tell which one has created him, which one he must obey and whose admonishments he must listen to since he could not recognize the true One who issues orders and admonishes us against others.Another reason is that were it possible for there to be two gods, then neither one was more deserving than the other one to be worshipped and obeyed. The permission to obey each one of them implied the permission to obey the partner. This would then imply the permission not to obey God. The permission not to obey God would imply disbelief in God; all His Books and Messengers; proof of all that is wrong; abandoning all that is right; allowing all that is forbidden; forbidding all that is allowed; partaking in all sins; abandoning all forms of obedience; authorizing all forms of corruption and abolishing all rights.’Another reason is that were it possible for more than one god to be, then this would allow Satan to declare himself to be the other god to oppose the Sublime God in all His Decrees and invite the people towards himself. This would result in greater disbelief and more serious dissimulation. \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why is it incumbent on the people to bear witness to God and that there is nothing like Him?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that they do not go after others and worship and obey none other than Him, so that the orders of their Lord and Creator and Sustainer are not dubious for them.Another reason is that should they not recognize that there is nothing like unto Him they might not realize the truth and establish these idols as their lord and creator - the idols which their forefathers have taken as their lords such as the sun, the moon, and the fire. Was it permissible that this issue be doubtful for them it would lead into corruption, abandoning all forms of obedience, committing all forms of sins according to the degree to which they were informed about its being allowed or admonished against by their lord.Another reason is that if it was not incumbent upon the people to realize that there is nothing like unto Him, that would allow them to think that He is subject to whatever the creatures are subject to - things such as disability, ignorance, change, destruction, termination, falsehood and oppression. There would be no hopes for the survival of, trust in the justness of, acceptability of the words, the decrees, the admonishments, the promises, the threats, the rewards or the chastisements of whoever has such traits. This would result in the corruption of the people and the abolition of His Lordship.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has the Sublime God ordered the servants and admonished them?’It is said, ‘Since their survival and the improvements in their affairs depends upon His ordering, admonishing, preventing them from corruption and unlawful seizure (of other people’s property.’ \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has He ordered the people to worship?’It is said, ‘So that they do not forget His remembrance, do not abandon His discipline, do not take His Orders and Admonishments lightly, since their peace and survival depends upon this. Were they left without any orders to worship and some time passed by, then their hearts would harden.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has He ordered the people to pray?’It is said, ‘Since praying is testifying to His Lordship. This is good for everyone since it implies abandoning other worshipped ones; humbly standing in front of the Omnipotent; subordination; subservience; obedience; confessing (to God’s Mastery); seeking the forgiveness of past sins. Praying also implies placing one’s face on the ground everyday so that one always remembers God; being submissive; really humble; eagerly wanting to improve one’s religious and worldly affairs; and despising corruption. Praying is done every day and night so that the servant does not forget his Planner and Creator; does not become ungrateful and rebellious; is always obedient to his Creator; stands in front of his Lord; is prevented from committing sins; and protects and guards himself against various forms of corruption.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that we have been ordered to perform the minor ritual ablution (wudu) and then start to worship?’It is said, ‘So that the servant is clean when he stands in front of the Omnipotent, and obeys His Orders when he is supplicating to Him. It is also done to be cleansed of any impurities and contaminations. Performing one’s ablutions will also eliminate indolence and slumber, and strengthen the heart in front of the Omnipotent.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that it is incumbent upon one to wash the face, hands, head and feet?It is said, ‘That is because when the servant stands in front of the Omnipotent, the parts of the body that must be washed by means of performance one’s ablutions are visible. That is because one expresses his humbleness and prostrates using his face; he implores God by using his hands, and fears God by means of them and uses them to sincerely turn towards the worship of God. One uses his head first when he bows down and prostrates. And with his feet he stands up and sits down.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that it has become incumbent upon one to wash the face and the hands, and only wipe the head and the feet (with one’s moist hand), but it has not become incumbent upon one to wash them all or wipe them all?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them is that the greatest form of worship is bowing down and prostrating. Bowing down and prostrating are both performed using the face and the hands, but not the head and the feet. Another reason is that people are not always ready to wash their heads and feet. This would be difficult for them to do in cold weather, when they are on a journey, when they are ill, and at certain times of the night and day. However, it is easier to wash the face and the hands than wipe the head and the feet. That is why the difficulty of the obligatory deeds are set up for the weakest of the healthy people. All the people - whether they are strong or weak - are obliged to perform them. Another reason is that the head and the feet are not always visible like the face and the hands as they are the places for turbans, shoes and other similar headwear or footwear items.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that only what leaves from the two sides and sleeping, but not anything else, voids the minor ritual ablution?’It is said, ‘The two sides are the pathways to release the human wastes. There are no other paths for man to let out waste from his body. So, they are ordered to clean themselves when they are exposed to such impurity.And regarding sleeping, when one falls asleep, he gets relaxed and his organs open up. Most of what leaves his body is gas. For that reason, it becomes incumbent upon him to perform the minor ritual ablution.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that we have not been ordered to perform the major ritual ablution to cleanse us from these impurities as we have been in case of major ritual impurity?’It is said, ‘That is because the minor ritual impurities are continuous, and it is not possible for the people to always perform major ritual ablutions for them. God does not oblige anyone to do what is beyond his ability. However, the major ritual impurity is not continuous. It is due to the overcoming of lust. One can decide to procrastinate lust or expedite it for three days, less or more. However, the same does not hold for going to the W.C.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that we have been ordered to perform the major ritual ablution for major ritual impurity and not ordered to perform the major ritual ablution for defecation while it is filthier than the major ritual impurity?’It is said, ‘Since the major ritual impurity leaves all of man’s self, that is it is the things that leave all the body, while in defecation it is not what is excreted out of all of the body. It is the food that enters from one side and the wastes which leave from the other side.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Let me know why we have been ordered to recite the ‘Azan?’It is said, ‘For many reasons. One of them is for it to serve as a reminder for those who forget, as an admonishment for those who neglect, as a time-marker for those who do not know the time so that they get busy doing the prayer. It is also to serve as a caller of the people to worship the Creator, to encourage them to bear witness to the Unity in it, to manifest the faith and propagate Islam. The ‘Azan is a call to those who have forgotten. The reason the caller of the ‘Azan (athan) is called ‘mo’athin is that he calls to the prayer.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why does it start with saying the ‘Takbir (‘God is the Greatest!’) before saying the ‘Tahlil (‘There is no god but God.’)It is said, ‘It is because He willed that His Name be mentioned first and His Name God the Sublime is said first in saying ‘God is the Greatest!’ However, the Name of God is the last word in ‘There is no god but God!’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is every phrase in the ‘Azan’ repeated twice?It is said, ‘They are repeated so that they are emphasized for those who hear them. If they neglect the first one, they can notice it the second time. The other reason is that since the prayer is said in two units, the phrases in the ‘Azan are also repeated.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why is the ‘Takbir repeated four times at the beginning of the ‘Azan?’It is said, ‘Since the ‘Azan begins when no one is paying any attention and there is nothing said before it to attract the attention of the listeners, it is done in order to draw the attention of the listeners to what will follow in the ‘Azan.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there the two testimonies after the ‘Takbir.’It is said, ‘Since the principal part of faith is Unity and testifying to the Unity of the Honorable the Exalted God. The second part of faith is testifying to the Prophethood of His Messenger. Obeying the two of them and recognizing the two of them equals faith. The principal part of faith is testifying. Thus the two testimonies are in the ‘Azan as there are two testimonies required in other legal affairs. Therefore, once one testifies to the Unity of the Sublime God and testifies to the Prophethood of the Prophet, he has indeed testified to all aspects of faith since the main part of faith is testifying to God and His Messenger.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there an invitation to praying after the two testimonies?’It is said, ‘Since basically the ‘Azan is said where it is meant to pray and is a call to prayer. Thus the call to prayer is in the middle of the ‘Azan with four phrases before it including two ‘Takbir’s plus two testimonies. Then four phrases come after it including two calls to prosperity urging us to devotion and praying followed by two calls encouraging us to do good deeds. Then the caller says two ‘Takbir’s and two ‘Tahlil’s completes the four last phrases as he did the first four phrases. He then finishes off by mentioning God just as he started out by mentioning the name of the Sublime God.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish saying ‘There is no god but God!’ at the end and did not establish saying ‘God is the Greatest!’ at the end as He did in the beginning of it?’It is said, ‘Because in saying There is no god but God! God’s Name comes last, and the Sublime God likes that speech ends in His Name as it opens in His Name.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there not ‘Tasbih (a.s.aying subhanallah; glory be to God) or ‘Tahmid (a.s.aying alhamdu lillah; Praise be to God) instead of ‘Tahlil (There is no god but God) which both also end in the Name of God?’It is said, ‘Since ‘Tahlil is testifying to the Unity of the Sublime God, and uprooting all deities other than God. It is the foundation of faith and is greater than ‘Tasbih or ‘Tahmid.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there a ‘Takbir at the beginning of the prayer and in each bowing down and prostrating?’ It is said, ‘It is for the same reason that we have mentioned about saying it in the ‘Azan.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there some supplications said in the first unit of the prayer before reciting the (required) verse (of the Holy Qur’an), but the ‘Qunut (a.s.upplicating during the prayer) is said after reciting the (required) verse (of the Holy Qur’an) in the second unit of the prayer?’It is said, ‘He dearly loved that His servants start their standing up for their Lord and worshipping Him by reciting His praises, sanctifying Him, being inclined towards Him and being humble to Him, and end it all in a similar fashion. Moreover, this is so that there is some possibility for him to extend his prayer in the ‘Qunut in congregational prayers, so that he can become synchronized with others in the other units and his unit of prayer does not fall out of synchronism with the congregation’s prayer.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to recite the Qur’an in our prayers?’It is said, ‘It is so that the Qur’an is not put aside and abandoned; and it be memorized and stay in the hearts not getting forgotten or destroyed.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why should we start each prayer recitation by reciting the Opening Chapter (‘Fatiha) and not any of the other (Qur’anic) chapters?’It is said, ‘This is because nowhere else in the Qur’an is there such a vast amount of good words and wisdom compiled together as there is in the Opening Chapter (‘Fatiha). That is when the Sublime God says, ‘Praisebe to Allah’ this would constitute the fulfillment of what the Sublime God has made incumbent upon His creatures in terms of expressing their gratitude to Him for whatever good He has granted His servants success in achieving. Saying ‘the Lord of the Two Worlds’ constitutes exalting and praising Him, testifying to Him that He is the Creator, the Owner and no one else is.Saying ‘The Most Gracious, Most Merciful’ constitutes seeking the pleasure of God and mentioning His Favours and Blessings for all His creatures.Saying ‘The Master of the Day of Judgment’ constitutes testifying to being resurrected, returning, reckoning and being punished. It also means considering the Dominion of the Hereafter for Him as the Dominion of this world is His.Saying ‘Thee do we worship’ constitutes being inclined towards Him and seeking proximity to the Honorable the Exalted God, sincerity of actions for Him and no one else.Saying ‘and Thine aid we seek’ constitutes seeking an increase in the success granted by Him, an increase in worshipping Him, the continuation of the blessings God has granted and His Assistance.Saying ‘and Show us the straight way’ constitutes seeking His Guidance towards His Discipline, grabbing onto His Rope, asking Him for an increase of one’s recognition of his Lord, His Glory, His Greatness and His Almightiness.Saying ‘The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace’ constitutes an emphasis on asking for and being inclined towards Him. It also constitutes mentioning what He has granted and His Blessings which He has given to His friends. It also constitutes asking the same things for oneself.Saying ‘those whose (portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray’ constitutes seeking refuge in Him from becoming one of the enemies or unbelievers; or becoming one who underestimates Him, what He enjoins to be done and what He admonishes against.Saying ‘…and who go not astray’ constitutes a form of grabbing onto Him so as not to be amongst those who have gone astray - those who have strayed away from His Path without recognition and thinking that they were doing good deeds.Therefore, (the Opening Chapter of the Qur’an) is a valuable collection of goodness and wisdom regarding the affairs of the Hereafter as well as this world in such a way that it does not exist anywhere else.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish ‘Tasbih in the bowing down and prostration?’It is said, ‘It is for several reasons. One of them is that the servant sanctifies God by being subordinate to Him; submits to Him; worships Him; fears Him; is humble to Him; and seeks proximity to his Lord. Another reason is that the servant be the one to praise, glorify, obey, exalt and thank his Creator and Sustainer, so that his mind is not misguided and his aspirations take him to others than God.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish the basic prayer to be two units, and one unit is added to some of the prayers and two units is added to some of the other prayers, and no units have been added to other prayers?’It is said, ‘It is because the basic prayer is just one unit, since the basic number is one. If it was less than one, it would not constitute a prayer. The Honorable the Exalted God knew that the servants would not always perform one unit of prayer perfectly, completely and with full attention. Therefore, He added another unit of prayer to it to complete the possible deficiencies one may have in the performance of one unit of prayer with saying two units of prayer. Hence, the Honorable, the Exalted God made the basic two-unit prayer obligatory. Then God’s Messenger (a.s.) knew that the servants would not totally and perfectly perform these two units which they are ordered to perform. Therefore, he added another two units to the noon, afternoon and night prayers to compensate for any deficiencies one may have in saying the first two units. Then he knew that the evening prayer is to be said when most of the people are busy working. Then they stop work to go home to break their fast, eat and drink, make ablutions, and prepare to go to sleep. Thus he added only one unit to the evening prayer to make it easier on them. He left the Morning Prayer as it was in order for the number of daily prayer units said to be an odd number. This was also because people are busier in the morning attending to their needs. Moreover, their hearts are not so involved with other thoughts due to the lack of doing business then, and are not tired. Thus man would be more attentive to his prayer in the morning in comparison to his other prayers, since his mind is free of daily activities.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it established to say ‘God is the Greatest!’ seven times at the beginning of the prayer?”It is said, ‘It is so because there are seven instances of saying ‘God is the Greatest!’ in the first unit - that is the basic prayer which consists of: one to start, one for bowing down, two for prostration, another one when bowing down and another two for the second prostration. That is why if a man says all the seven instances of ‘God is the Greatest!’ in the beginning of his prayer, he has said all the seven; and should he mistakenly forget to say anyone of them, there would be no insufficiencies in his prayer.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there one bowing down and two prostrations in each unit?”It is said, ‘Bowing down is a part of the prayer said while standing up, and prostration is the part of prayer said while sitting down. Prayer said while sitting down counts as half of the prayer said while standing up. That is why prostration is doubled so as to make it weigh the same as the bowing down, so that there is no difference between them since prayer is indeed made up of the bowing down and the prostration.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is the call as a witness (tashahhud) established after the bowing down and the prostration?”It is said, ‘It is because calling as a witness has been decreed before the bowing down and prostration in the ‘Azan, the supplications and the recitations. Therefore, He ordered that calling as a witness, praising and supplications also be said after them.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why did He establish the saying of ‘Salaam as the termination of the prayer, and did not set saying ‘God is the Greatest!’ or ‘Glory be to God!’ or something else instead to end the prayer?”It is said, ‘So that it be coordinated with the entrance into the prayer. After starting the prayers, it is forbidden to talk to the creatures, and one should only attend to the Creator. Therefore, He terminates the parayers with the creature’s word and turns one’s attention over to them as people start speaking to each other by saying ‘Salaam.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘why is there reciting the Qur’anic Chapters in the first two units and saying the glorifications in the last two units of the prayer?’It is said, ‘This is in order to make a clear distinction between what the Honorable the Exalted God made incumbent Himself and what His Messenger (a.s.) made incumbent upon the believers (as the last two units of the prayer were added by the Prophet (S)).’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there congregational prayers?’It is said, ‘It is so that sincerity, the belief in Unity, Islam and the worship of God are publicly seen, since this would serve as a proof of the One the Honorable the Exalted God for the people of the East and the West. It will also serve as a means by which the hypocrites and those who underestimate the prayer would at least have to publicly perform what they claim to adhere to. It will also serve as a means for the Muslims to testify to the adherence of their fellow Muslim brethren to Islam. There are also other certain benefits in congregational prayers such as encouragement to do good deeds and advising to piety, and admonishing against doing many of the acts of disobedience to the Honorable the Exalted God.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are some prayers to be said in a loud voice while others are not?’It is said, ‘The prayers that are to be said in a loud voice are those that are performed in the darkness of the night. They should be said in a loud voice so that if anyone is passing by he can tell that a congregational prayer is being held there and he can attend it if he wishes to do so. If he does not see the group of people, at least he can hear them and get informed through hearing. Regarding the prayers that are performed in the daytime, a passer-by can see the people praying and there is no need for him to be able to hear them pray.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the prayers established for these certain times, not sooner or later?”It is said, ‘Since these times are known by everyone on the Earth. Therefore, the ignorant and the knowledgeable ones knew these four times: Sunset is well-known and clear, thus the evening prayer is made incumbent at that time. The disappearance of the evening twilight is well-known and clear, thus the night prayer is made incumbent at that time. Sunrise is well-known and clear, thus the morning prayer is made incumbent at that time. The sun’s noon position is well-known and clear,that is why the noon prayer is incumbent at that time. There is no clearly defined time for the afternoon prayer as there is for the other prayers. Its time has been established to be after finishing the noon prayer.Another reason is that the Honorable the Exalted God likes that the people start doing everything by obeying and worshipping Him. That is why He has ordered them to worship Him at the beginning of the day and then engage in what they themselves like to do to improve their worldly affairs. Thus He made it incumbent upon them to say the morning prayer.When midday comes and the people stop working, they take off their clothes, relax, eat and rest. God has ordered them to start this by mentioning and worshipping Him first and has thus made it incumbent upon them to say the noon prayers first and then do the other things that they like to do. Once they want to go out to do what they like, God has made it incumbent upon them to say the afternoon prayers and then go after what improves their worldly affairs. And once the night comes, they quit work and return home, they must begin with the worship of their Lord. Thus God has made it incumbent upon them to say the evening prayer. Once it is time to go to sleep and they are relieved of their daily affairs, God likes them to first attend to His worship and obedience and then pursue their own affairs. Thus they should start each section of the day with performing His obedience and worship. Therefore, God has made it incumbent upon them to do the night prayer. Once they do so they will not forget Him, become neglectful of Him, their hearts will not get hard, and their inclination to God will not decrease.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there not a clearly defined time for the afternoon prayer like the other prayers? Why is it that it is done between the noon and the evening prayers and not between the night and the morning prayers, or between the morning and the noon prayers?’It is said, ‘Since no time is easier and more convenient than this time for both the weak and the powerful people. All the people attend to their work from the beginning of the day: such as doing business; making deals; going after their necessities; and opening their shops. Thus God did not want to hinder them from seeking their sustenance and improving their worldly life.All the people cannot get up at night. They do not even understand what waking up at night is. If it be made obligatory that they will wake up todo it even if it were in the middle of the night - this is not very feasible for them to do. Thus God has facilitated it for them and has not set the prayer for the hardest times to say as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…Allah intends every facility for you; He does not want to put you to difficulties…’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘What are the reasons for raising the hands when saying ‘Takbir?’It is said, ‘The reason for raising the hands when saying ‘Takbir is that this act involves a certain degree of invocation and supplication. The Honorable the Exalted God likes His servant to be invoking and supplicating to Him at the time of remembering Him. Thus by raising the hands, one becomes more attentive to and more thoughtful of what he intends to say and what he says.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the recommendable prayers thirty-four units?’It is said, ‘Since the obligatory prayers are seventeen units. The recommendable prayers have been established to be double that amount to perfect the obligatory ones.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the recommendable prayers set for various times and not for a fixed given time?’It is said, ‘Since the best of the times are three: dawn, noon and then evening. God likes that the people pray to Him at these three times. Also, if the prayers are spread around at different times rather than all being set for a fixed given time, they are easier to perform for all the people.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that the Friday prayer is only two units if said with the prayer leader, but it is four units if it is not said with a prayer leader?’It is said, ‘For several reasons. One of them being that the people come from far distances to say the congregational prayers. The Honorable the Exalted God likes to give them a discount, and make it easier for them considering the distance that they have covered. Another reason is that the prayer leader keeps them there to deliver the sermon, and they have to wait for the prayer. In fact, whoever is waiting to pray it is as if he is praying, and this is considered to be a perfect prayer by itself. Another reason is that saying the prayer with a prayer leader is more complete due to the prayer leader’s knowledge, jurisprudence, justness, and nobility.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has it been established to deliver sermons?’It is said, ‘Since on Fridays the people gather together. Delivering sermons is a means by which the prayer leader can advise the people and encourage them to obey God. He may admonish them against committing sins, inform them about what would improve their religious and worldly affairs, inform them about the various issues and the conditions which might lead to their benefit or loss.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why have two sermons been designated (for the congregational prayer)?’It is said, ‘So that there is one sermon in which to glorify, praise and sanctify the Honorable the Exalted God, and there is another one in which they attend to the needs of the people; admonish the people against committing sins and violating the laws; supplicate (to God); express what they wish to teach the people; and advise and admonish the people regarding what would lead to improvements or corruption.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has it been established that the Friday sermons be delivered before the prayers, but be delivered after the prayers on holidays?’It is said, ‘Since Friday prayers are to be held every week of the month and every month of the year. Also since it is said that often the people might leave the prayer after it is said, if the sermons were to be delivered after saying the prayers. Once the people say the prayers they would disperse and not wait for the sermon, and most or all of them might not stay for the sermon. Therefore, the sermon is to be delivered before the prayers, so that the people do not disperse or leave when the sermons are delivered. However, there are only two ‘Eid prayers each year which are much more magnificent than the Friday prayers, and many more people attend the ‘Eid prayers, since more of them are interested in attending them. Even if some people decide to leave after saying the prayers, most of the people still remain. The sermon is also not repeated, so it will not be so boring that the people ignore it.’The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) - may God have Mercy upon him - said, ‘This is how this tradition has been narrated. However, the sermons in both the Friday prayers and the ‘Eid (holiday) prayers are delivered after the prayer, since they are considered as the two final unitsof the prayers. The first one who said the sermons before the prayers was Uthman ibn Affan, since the people detested him for his wrongdoings. They did not stay after the prayers to listen to his sermons and thought to themselves that his sermons were of no use, since he had done whatever he wanted to do. Therefore, he delivered the two sermons before the prayers, so that at least the people would wait for the prayer and not disperse.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it that attending the Friday prayers is made incumbent upon those who live at a distance of at most two ‘Farsakhs away from where the prayers are held and no more?’It is said, ‘The distance for which the prayers will be shortened, if traveled back and forth is eight ‘Farsakhs, that is four ‘Farsakhs to go and four ‘Farsakhs to return. Attending the Friday prayers is made incumbent upon the people who live at most half that distance away. Thus, the distance traveled is not as much as would result in the shortening of the prayers. Rather it is half as much as once covered by someone, he would be considered a traveler.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are four units of prayers added to the recommendable prayers on Fridays?’It is said, ‘It is to honor this day and make a distinction between it and other days.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the prayers shortened when we are on a journey?’It is said, ‘Since the obligatory prayers were ten units to start with and the other seven units were added to them later. Therefore, God deleted the additional seven units while we are on a journey due to the hardships of traveling and the efforts we must exert in terms of going and stopping at the way-stations in the performance of our own affairs. This shortening of the prayers is a form of Mercy from God and it is due to His Kindness - except for the evening prayers which cannot be shortened, since they are shortened to begin with.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is shortening the prayers valid after you travel eight ‘Farsakhs back and forth - no more and no less?’It is said, ‘Since eight ‘Farsakhs is the distance which all people can travel back and forth in a single day - whether they walk, ride, are in a convoy or a caravan, or carry loads. That is why the extent of distance for shortening the prayers has been established to be the distance of one-day’s travel back and forth.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is shortening the prayers made incumbent for a distance of one day’s travel back and forth and no more?’It is said, ‘If a limit of a distance for one day’s travel was not established for shortening the prayers, then even the distance of one year’s travel would not have been established. This is because days come one after another and they are all similar to each other. If it were not established for this day, it would not have been established for any other day since all the other days are similar to each other and there is no differences between them.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘There are some differences in the speed of traveling. Why was the distance of eight ‘Farsakhs established as the distance of one day’s traveling back and forth?’It is said, ‘Since eight ‘Farsakhs is the distance which camels and the caravans usually travel in one day, and thus it is the distance which the people riding camels and the caravans can travel in one day.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the recommendable prayers (nafila) for the daytime abandoned, but the recommendable prayers for the night still valid?’It is said, ‘The recommendable prayers for any of the prayers which are not shortened on a journey are still said. That is why the recommendable prayer for the evening prayer which must be said in the same way whether we are at home or on a journey, are still said. Also all the recommendable prayers after the evening prayer and the Morning Prayer which is not shortened, and the recommendable prayers before it are still said.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are the recommendable prayers for the night prayer which is shortened on a journey still said?’It is said, ‘These two units are not included amongst the fifty units of the obligatory and recommendable prayers. Rather they have been added to the fifty units, so that for each unit of obligatory prayer there are two units of recommendable prayers.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are those on a journey and the ill permitted to perform their night prayers at the nightfall?’It is said, ‘Since a traveler has some things to take care of and the ill have some weaknesses requiring them to rest at night. Therefore, they have been permitted to say their night prayers at the nightfall, so that the ill can rest and the traveler can attend to the affairs related to his journey.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to say prayers for the dead?’It is said, ‘In order to intercede on their behalf and to ask God’s forgiveness for them, since there is no other time than just after death in which the passed-away person is in need of intercession and asking God to forgive him.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there five ‘Takbirs in the prayer for the dead, not four or six?’It is said, ‘There is one for each of the five daily prayers.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why is there no bowing down or prostration in the prayer for the dead?’It is said, ‘Since this prayer is meant as an intercession for him. What this servant has left behind is of no use to him now and he needs what he has sent ahead.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to perform the burial ceremonial bath for the dead?’It is said, ‘Since when someone dies, filth, calamities and harm overcomes the corpse. Now that he is going to meet the pure ones from the angels who will accompany him and touch him, he likes to be clean and pure himself and be taken towards the Honorable the Exalted God in a clean state. Whoever dies, the sperm with which he was at first created will be discharged from his body and he will be in a state of major ritual impurity. Thus he must have the major ritual ablution performed for him.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to shroud the corpse?’It is said, ‘So that he meets his Lord - the Honorable the Exalted - with a clean corpse, his private parts are not seen by those who carry and buryhim, the people cannot see his state and the ugliness of the sight. The change of odor when looking at bodies infected with some diseases a lot would make one hard-hearted due to the decay and defects in them. The corpse is shrouded so that it looks good to the on-lookers and his friends do not see his decayed naked body which would result in detesting him. Also seeing the corpse would make them forget him, abandon his friendship, not make an effort to protect what he has left behind, not act upon his will as well as abandon what he has willed whether it be incumbent or recommendable.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to bury him?”It is said, ‘So that the decay of his corpse, the ugly scene and the bad smell is not experienced by the people. Also its smell should not bother the living, and its scars, injuries and decay are hidden from the sight of his friends and enemies, so as not to please his enemies or sadden his friends.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has the one performing the major ritual ablution for the dead been ordered to perform the major ablution himself?”It is said, ‘It is because he must be cleansed of the water splashed on him from the corpse, since once the spirit leaves the body of the dead, many injuries, scars and causes of infection remain on the corpse.”\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why then is it not obligatory to perform the major ritual ablution for touching the dead carcasses of other beings than men - such as birds, grazing or ravenous animals, and similar creatures?It is said, ‘It is because they have either feathers, wool, hair or fluff which do not perish and remain clean. It makes no difference whether you touch them when the animal is dead or alive.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why is it allowed to say the prayer for the dead without making ablutions?’It is said, ‘It is because this prayer consists of no bowing down or prostration and is merely supplications and requesting. It is permitted to supplicate to God and ask Him (for something) in any condition. Making ablutions is obligatory for prayers in which there is bowing down and prostration.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it allowed to say the funeral prayers before evening time and after the morning?’It is said, ‘It is because this prayer must be said whenever the corpse is present. Therefore, the reason is simply the presence of the corpse. There is no set time for it like other prayers. This is a form of prayer that is to be said whenever something happens which is not under man’s control. It is only a right that must be honored, and nothing else. One can honor the rights whenever he can. There is no set time for that.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is there a prayer to be said when there is an eclipse?’It is said, ‘It is because an eclipse is one of the signs of the Honorable the Exalted God. It is not clear whether it will result in Mercy or Chastisement. That is why the Prophet (S) desired that his nation turn to their Creator and His Mercy when it occurs. Thereby they would be relieved of the evil and would be protected from its possible harm as the people of Yunus (a.s.) did when they beseeched the Honorable the Exalted God.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there ten times of bowing down in it?’It is said, ‘The prayer which has been made incumbent (upon man for an eclipse) and has descended from the heavens to the Earth was ten units and consisted of ten times of bowing down. All the ten times are put together in this prayer. There cannot be a prayer with bowing down and prostration. Therefore, prostration is made incumbent in this prayer. Moreover, this prayer has prostration in it so that the people can terminate their prayers with humbleness. Therefore, four prostrations have been set in the eclipse prayer and the prayer is invalidated whenever any of them is forgotten, since four prostrations is the minimum requirement for each prayer.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why were the bowing downs substituted with prostrations?’It is said, ‘It is because praying while standing up is nobler than praying while sitting down. Also one who is standing would see the eclipse, and its termination while one who is prostrating would not see it.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are its fundamentals changed from what God has made incumbent (upon man in prayer)?’It is said, ‘It is because this prayer is designated for changes in the normal sequence of natural events - that is the eclipse. Since the cause has changed, the result will also change.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has the day for breaking the fast been established as a holiday?’It is said, ‘It is so that there are congregations in which Muslims gather together on that day, stand before the Honorable the Exalted God and praise Him for what He has bestowed upon them. That day is considered to be a special holiday and it is the day for the people to gather together. It is the day to break the fast, pay the alms-tax, long for and be humble to God, since that is the first day of the new year in which eating and drinking is allowed. This is because for the people of the truth the first month of the year is the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan. Thus, the Honorable the Exalted God likes them to hold congregations on that day in which they get together to praise and sanctify Him.’\u003Cbr\u003E \u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there more ‘Takbirs in it compared to all other prayers?’ It is said, ‘Since ‘Takbir constitutes glorifying God and thanking Him for guidance and health as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…(He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful.’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there twelve ‘Takbirs in the congregation prayer on the ‘Eid prayer for Ramadhan?’It is said, ‘It is because there are twelve ‘Takbirs in each two units of prayers. Thus there are twelve ‘Takbirs in the congregation prayer on the ‘Eid prayer for Ramadhan.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there seven ‘Takbirs in the first unit and five in the second? Why are there not the same number of ‘Takbirs in each unit?’ It is said, ‘Since there are seven ‘Takbirs in the obligatory prayers, the first unit of this prayers starts with seven ‘Takbirs. There are five ‘Takbirs in the second unit, since there are a total of five ‘Takbirs to start all the daily prayers (one for each prayer). This is also done so that the number of ‘Takbirs in each prayer be an odd number.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to fast?’ It is said, ‘It is so that you can realize the feeling of hunger, thirst, and poverty in the Hereafter. It is also because by fasting you show reverence, humbleness and submissiveness, so that you patiently and knowingly benefit from your suffering thirst and hunger. In addition, fasting serves as a means of the elimination of lust; and acts as an advisor for you for the present; apractice for you to perform your duties and a proof for the Hereafter. Also fasting is a means for you to realize the extent of hardships suffered from poverty in this world, so as give to the poor the portion of your property which God has made incumbent upon you to pay to them.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is fasting established to be done in the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan and not in the other months?’It is said, ‘It is because Ramadhan is the month in which the Sublime God sent down the Qur’an in which there exists what would distinguish between right and wrong as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur’an, as a guide to mankind, also clear (a.s.igns) for guidance and judgment (Between right and wrong)…’ The revelations were revealed to Muhammad (a.s.) in that month. The Night of Power (‘Qadr) is better than a thousand months and ‘In the (Night) is made distinct every affair of wisdom.’ It is the beginning of the year on which everything - whether good or bad, loss or gain, life or death - is destined. That is why it is called the Night of Power (‘Qadr).’And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to fast during the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan - no more and no less?’It is said, ‘It is because that is the extent of fasting which both the weak ones and the strong ones can tolerate. God has made incumbent upon man the obligatory deeds to the extent that the majority of the people can do them. Then He has given the weak ones some leeway and has encouraged the strong ones to do more. If less than this was better for them, God would have made less than this incumbent upon them and if more than this was better for them, God would have made more than this incumbent upon them.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why should a menstruating woman neither pray nor fast?’It is said, ‘Since she is in an unclean state then and God does not like us to worship Him unless we are clean. Moreover, whoever cannot pray cannot fast.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why should she make up her fasting but not make up her prayers?’It is said, ‘There are several reasons for this. One of them is that fasting would not hinder her from doing her usual daily chores: such as her personal affairs; serving her husband; fixing things in the house; attending to the affairs of the house; and engaging in the affairs of life. However, praying would prevent her from doing all these things, since prayers are repeated over and over every day. A woman does not have enough strength to do this. However, fasting is not that way. Another reason is that praying involves exertion of an effort to sit down, stand up, and move up and down but fasting does not involve any of these acts. Fasting only consists of not eating and drinking. The body parts are not involved in it. Another reason is that there is always some prayers which must be said during the day and the night. However, fasting is not so. It is not like praying which is incumbent upon one to do every day. It is not incumbent upon one to fast every day.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it the case that for someone who is ill during the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan and does not get better until the next Ramadhan, or is on a journey during the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan and does not end his journey up until the next Ramadhan, the fasting days he missed should not be made up, and it suffices for him to pay for the compensation of it? Why is it the case that if such a person gets well or his journey ends before the next Ramadhan should make up his missed fasts and also pay for the compensation?’It is said, ‘Fasting was incumbent upon him during the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan of that year. It was put off to a later time since he was ill or on a journey. He is excused from fasting since he did not get better during the year or his journey did not end, but he must pay for the compensation of his missed fasting days. This is because the Sublime God has sent the illness upon him and he has not found a way to get better. God has not left any means of performing his duty for him, since an ill person cannot fast. One who is on a journey should not fast either. Therefore, he is excused from fasting. The same holds true for anything else which God brings upon him such as becoming unconscious. Let’s suppose someone is unconscious for one day. He does not have to make up the prayers for that day as (Imam) As-Sadiq (a.s.) said, ‘God has excused His servants from anything which God Himself descends upon him.’ Since at the beginning of Ramadhan, he has been excused from fasting and this excuse has remained valid until the next year, then hemust pay the compensation, and he does not have to make up the fasts. He is like someone who is always unable to fast as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘\u003Cbr\u003E And if any has not (the wherewithal), he should fast for two months consecutively before they touch each other. But if any is unable to do so, he should feed sixty indigent ones…’And as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…(He should) in compensation either fast, or feed the poor, or offer sacrifice…’ Here giving charity has been established as a compensation for fasting when the Hajj pilgrim is in a distressful state.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘What if he was not able to make it up then, but is able to do so now?It is said, ‘Since his excuse has remained valid until the next Ramadhan, God’s decree regarding him is that he pay the compensation for the missed days of fasting. He is considered to be like someone who must pay the compensation for missing his fasts due to some act and cannot fast. Thus he does not have to fast, but he must pay the compensation. However, if he gets well before the next Ramadhan, but does not make up the days for the missed fasting days, he must make up the fasting and pay the compensation that is due to be paid by him, since he has been able to make up that fasting.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there recommendable fasts?’It is said, ‘They exist so as to complete the obligatory fasts.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are there three designated days (for recommendable fasts) each month and one day (for recommendable fasts) in each ten days of the month?’It is said, ‘It is because the Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit…’ Therefore, whoever fasts one day out of each ten days, it is as if he has fasted the whole year long as Salman al-Farsi - may God have Mercy upon him - said, ‘Fasting three days each month is considered to be fasting all the time. Whoever finds more time should fast more.’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why are recommendable fasts set for the Thursdays of the first and the last ten days of the month, as well as the Wednesdays of the second ten days of the month?’It is said, ‘As for Thursday (Imam) As-Sadiq (a.s.) said, ‘A servant’s (i.e. a person’s) deeds are presented to the Honorable the Exalted God each Thursday. Thus God likes His servants to be fasting when the servants’ deeds are presented to the Sublime God.”’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks: ‘Why are recommendable fasts set for the last Thursday of the month?’It is said, ‘Since it is better during the third ten days of the month if the servant’s deeds for the last eight days are presented to God while he has fasted than if his deeds for only two days are of his deeds presented to God while he has fasted. Also Wednesday has been set in the middle ten days of each month, since (Imam) As-Sadiq (a.s.) narrated, ‘The Honorable the Exalted God created Fire on this day. He destroyed the previous nations (who sinned) on that day. It is a day which always has (been considered to be a ) bad omen. And God likes his servant to fend off the bad omen from himself by fasting.’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why is it incumbent upon those who do not have the financial means to fast as expiation. Why can’t they go on the Hajj pilgrimage, pray or do other (good) deeds as expiation?’It is said, ‘It is because praying, going on the Hajj pilgrimage and other obligatory deeds would hinder one from attending to his worldly affairs and improving his life. The same reason cited for making up the fast of the semi-menstruant who should only make up her fast not her prayers applies here, too.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has the expiation been established to be fasting for two consecutive months? Why is it not one month or three months?’It is said, ‘It is because God has made fasting for one month incumbent upon the people. He doubled the fasting days to be an expiation so as to emphasize the importance of fasting and be stern.’If he asks, ‘Why did He establish the compensation for fasting to be two consecutive months?’It is said, ‘It is so that they do not underestimate fasting. If the fasting is performed spread over a span of time, it would not seem to be that difficult.’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to go on the Hajj pilgrimage?It is said, ‘It is because it is a form of going towards God; asking him for numerous rewards; and departing from all (evil) that one has committed; to be repentant for all that he has done in the past; and to start what he will do in the future.The Hajj pilgrimage is also done so that one can expend his wealth and puts himself to trouble; experiences separation from his spouse and children; avoids lust and pleasure; suffers from the troubles of the trip in the heat, cold, and fear for a long span of time along with humility, courtesy and humbleness. The Hajj pilgrimage also benefits the people in the East or the West of the Earth - whether they live in the deserts or at sea; partake in the Hajj pilgrimage or not; import goods; do business; sell or buy; are dealers or the needy; rent riding animals or are too poor to rent any riding animals to go on the Hajj pilgrimage. It also includes the fulfillment of the needs of the people who live in the vicinity where the Hajj pilgrims gather together.It also includes the training of and the narration of the traditions from the Immaculate Leaders (a.s.) from one region over to another region as the Sublime God said, ‘Nor should the Believers all go forth together: if a contingent from every expedition remained behind, they could devote themselves to studies in religion, and admonish the people when they return to them,- that thus they (may learn) to guard themselves (against evil).’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why have we been ordered to go on the Hajj pilgrimage once and not more?”It is said, ‘It is because the Sublime God established the obligatory deeds taking into consideration the weakest people as the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘…He must make an offering, such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it…’ This refers to a sheep that both the rich and the poor can offer. The other obligatory deeds are the same way and are established considering the weakest people. One of the obligatory deeds is to go on the Hajj pilgrimage which is obligatory once in one’s lifetime. God has encouraged the rich people to perform it as often as they can.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to go on the ‘Tamatu (major) Hajj pilgrimage?”It is said, ‘This is a mitigation from your Lord and is out of His Mercy, so that the people may leave their state of ritual consecration for the Hajj, and this period does not become too long for them making them enter into corruption. Both (major) Hajj and ‘Umra (minor Hajj) are obligatory. Remaining in the state of consecration for the first one is like voiding the consecration for the second one. That is so that Hajj is not performed without ‘Umra, and there would be a clear distinction between them. And the Prophet (S) said, ‘‘Umra is attached to Hajj all the way up until the Resurrection Day.’ Had the Prophet (S) not brought an offering along and could leave the state of ritual consecration, he (a.s.) would have done as he ordered the people to do. That is why the Prophet (S) said, ‘Had I not brought my offering along with me, I would have performed my last deed as I ordered you to do. However I have brought along the offering, and one who brings along the offering cannot leave the state of ritual consecration for the Hajj until he makes the offering.’ Then a man stood up and said, ‘O God’s Prophet! Will we leave as Hajji’s while sperm is dripping down our heads due to major ritual impurity?’ The Prophet (S) told him, ‘You will never ever believe in this.’’\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why has its time been established to be during the first ten days of the (Arabic) month of Dhul-Hajja?It is said, ‘The Sublime God likes His servants to worship Him during the period of ‘Tashriq since these days are the days on which the angels went on the Hajj pilgrimage for God for the first time (and the days) during which they circumambulated around Him. Then He established this as a tradition for mankind all the way up until the Resurrection Day. And the Prophets Adam (a.s.), Noah (a.s.), Abraham (a.s.), Moses (a.s.), Jesus (a.s.) and Muhammad (a.s.) and all the other Prophets performed the Hajj pilgrimage during the same period of time. This has become a tradition for their progeny all the way up until the Resurrection Day.\u003Cbr\u003E And if he asks, ‘Why we have been ordered to enter the state of ritual consecration for the Hajj (by wearing ‘Ihram)?’It is said, ‘That is so as to be humble before entering the Honorable the Exalted God’s Shrine and His Protection. That is so as to quit licentiousness; engaging in worldly affairs, its ornaments and pleasures;to struggle hard to achieve what they have set out to do there; to go towards doing what they have set out to do; as well as what there is in the ‘Ihram including the exaltation of the Sublime God and His House. Entering the state of ritual consecration means humbleness to Him, hoping His Rewards; fearing His Chastisements; going towards Him in a state of humbleness, subordination and submissiveness. And blessings be upon Muhammad (a.s.) and his Household.’Abdul Wahid Muhammad ibn Ubdoos al-Neishaboori al-Attar - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Qutayba al-Neishaboori quoted on the authority of Al-Fadhl ibn Shathan who heard these narrations on the reasons behind decrees I told him, “Let me know whether these reasons which you expressed were out of your own understanding and deductions due to the results of intellectual reasoning or you have heard them and are narrating them?” He told me, “I am not one to know the Sublime God’s purpose behind what He has made incumbent (upon us), or know the purpose of God’s Messenger (a.s.) for what he has decreed and established as tradition. Neither can I express the reasons myself. However, what I have expressed was what I have heard from my Master (Imam) Abil Hassan Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) on different occasions, one after the other. Then I compiled them together.” Then I asked him, “Can I narrate these traditions on your authority on the authority of Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)?” He replied, “Yes.”Al-Hakim Abu Muhammad Ja’far ibn Nu’aym ibn Shathan - may God be pleased with him - narrated that his uncle Abi Abdullah Muhammad ibn Shathan quoted on the authority of Al-Fadhl ibn Shathan, “I heard this reasoning from my Master Abil Hassan ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) on different occasions, and I compiled them together.",

There a man stood up whose color was pale, as if he was a Yemeni Jew, and said: “O Commander of the Faithful! Describe your Creator, and praise Him for us such that we may see Him.” Hence, `Ali (AS) praised his Lord, and exalted His Greatness, the Mighty and High, in the following words: All praise be to Allah, who is the First not from something, nor hidden in something, and who does not vanish nor unite with something. He is not an imaginary delusion. He is neither a shape that He may be watched, not a body so He may have parts. He is not with an end that He may terminate. He is not accidental [muhdath] so He may be seen. He is neither covered that He may be uncovered, not is He with veils so He may be comprised. He was there, but no space was there to carry Him in its sides, nor any carrier to life Him with its power. Neither has He come into being after not being there. In fact, the imaginations are baffled to assume a shape for the One who formed all things and is still without space, and does not decline with the variation of time. He does not transform from one quality to another. He is far from the supposition of hearts. He is Exalted above all things and varieties. He is the Single, and the Knower of the Unseen. Thus, the meanings of the creation are negated from Him, and their secrets are not hidden from Him. He is the Known without quality. He is not perceived through the senses and not compared with people. Eyes do not perceive Him. Thoughts cannot encompass Him. Intellects cannot assess Him, and imaginations cannot imagine Him. Hence, any likeness of Him conceived by the intellect is limited. And how could He be described with shapes and praised with eloquent tongues? He neither occurred in things, so it may be said that He is in them, nor left them, that it may be said that He is obvious. Neither is He free from them so it may be said `where.’ He is neither so close to them as to stick to them, nor so far from them as to be split. But He is in the things without quality. He is closer to us than our jugular vein, and further ways than what is most far. He has neither created things with the origin of eternity, nor from prior examples. In fact, He created what He created, and made it strong. He imagined what He imagined and beautified it. Thus, praise be Him who is Unique in His Elevation. Hence, nothing can refuse to Him His decree. Nor does He gain anything through the obedience of His Creation. His Response to callers is quick. The Angels in the Heavens and the Earth are submissive to Him. He addressed Moses with words without limbs, instruments, lips or uvulas. Praise be Him and Exalted is He from attributes. Thus, whoever supposes that the God of the Creation is limited then he is ignorant of God, the Creator.

    "englishText": "4. In a Hadith from Malik ibn A’yan the following is narrated: “In the battle of Siffin, Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.), encouraging people said, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has shown you a bargain and a deal which will save you from the painful torment. Belief in Allah and Jihad for the cause of Allah bring you very close to goodness. He makes your reward to be forgiveness of your sins and fine dwellings in paradise of Eden. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Allah certainly loves those who fight for His cause and stand firm as solid and strong structures.” (61:4) ‘You must form yourselves in straight lines like solid and strong structures. Allow those with coats of arms to be in front and those without it to be the next. You must fix your back-teeth against each other; it makes the sword strike harder on the head of the enemy. Launch your spears, they move swiftly. Look with a lower angle; it ties down excitement and relaxes the heart. Silence voices; it keeps failure away and it is better for dignity. You must not allow your banners to incline and you must not remove them. You must not allow anyone other than brave people to carry them. The defenders of what is very important, who can exercise patience in difficult conditions, deserve to be the protectors. You must not mutilate those who are killed, and when you reach the men of the enemy you must not expose privacies, you must not enter any house, you must not take anything of their properties except what you find with their army. You must not disturb any woman with mistreatment; and if they use bad words against your honor, men, virtuous ones among you, it is because they suffer from physical, psychological and intellectual weakness. We were ordered to hold our hands back from them and they were pagan women. If a man would take upon women this would remain a flaw in him and in his descendants after him. You must take notice, people capable of protecting important matters deserve to carry the banner to provide it protection and others walk on the sides, behind and in front of them, and they must not lose sight of it (the banner) and must not remain far behind nor must they go far ahead to become separated. I pray to Allah to grant blessings to one who cooperates with his brother (in faith) with his person. One should not leave his peer against his brother so that his peer and his brother fight. This brings regret and humiliation. This inevitably becomes his (enemy’s) fight against two people if he holds his hands back and has left his peer alone against his brother and has run away. He just looks to him and this one. If one does it he has angered Allah. You must not expose yourselves to the anger of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. “Running away does not benefit you even if you run away from death, or from being killed, because thereafter you will not benefit more than very little.” (33:16) I swear by Allah, if you run away from the swords nearby, you will not escape from the swords later on. You must seek help by exercising patience and truthfulness. Victory comes only after exercising patience. You must do Jihad for the cause of Allah, the way Jihad should be done and there is no power without Allah.’ “He (the Imam) (a.s.), passed by the banner of the people of al-Sham and found them holding their position. He said, ‘They will not move from their position without a blow which is hard and expels the soul out, and a blow that splits the skull, crushes the bones and makes the arms and the hands to fall off so that their forehead is crushed by the iron bars, their eyebrows scatter over their chest and chin. Where are people of patience and seekers of reward?’ A group of the Muslims marched to them. The right flank of this group returned back to the center and exposed those opposite to them. He (a.s.), moved forward until he reached them and said, ‘I saw your attack and retreat away from your positioned lines. It was your moving that provided a chance for the unjust and tyrants of al-Sham. You are the top most among Arab and the great peak, the beauty of the nights because of your recitations of the Holy Quran and the callers from among the people of the truth, while the sinners are lost. Were it not for your advance after your retreat and your regrouping after giving way to the enemy, you could have become subject to what those fleeing from the enemy during an advancing operation need to face for turning their backs to the enemy. I would find you of those being destroyed. My concerns are to a small degree reduced and my chest to a small degree is comforted. This happened when I saw you gain the ground over them as they had against you and you were able to remove them from their positions as they had done to you. I saw you strike them with your sword until their first line was toppled over the last line like the camel driven away. You must exercise patience. Comfort has come upon you and Allah has made you steadfast with certainty, so that the defeated notice that he is making his Lord angry. He hates his own self. In fleeing from the battle there is the anger of Allah, the inevitable humiliation, and a remaining stigma and destruction of ways of one’s living. There is no increase in the longevity of life of the fleeing person, no barrier between him and his day of death, and his Lord does not become happy with him. One’s death with truthfulness before achieving such characteristics is better than remaining with them and dwelling upon them.’ “In another of his speech he (a.s.), has said, ‘When you face these people (the enemy) tomorrow do not fight them before they attack you. When they attack you then rise against them. You must remain calm and dignified. You must fix your backside teeth against the teeth of opposite side. It delivers a harder hit on the skulls. Keep your eyes lower and look at the foreheads of the horses and the faces of men. Reduce your speech; it keeps failure and argumentations away. You must settle your souls up facing the enemy openly, to advance and to attack. You must remain steadfast and speak of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, very often. One who protects what is important in difficult times is of the protecting people who keep their banner on the side and others walk on its sides and in front. When you attack do it with such coordination as if it is one man’s attack. You must be protective; war is bitter. You must not allow them (enemy) to attack you after retreat or to advance to you after an unpredictable move. If one surrenders, accept it from him. Seek help from exercising patience; victory from Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, follows exercising patience. Allah’s servants will inherit the earth and the good end belongs to those who maintain piety before Allah.’” ",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "4. In a Hadith from Malik ibn A’yan the following is narrated: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "“In the battle of Siffin, Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.), encouraging people said, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has shown you a bargain and a deal which will save you from the painful torment. Belief in Allah and Jihad for the cause of Allah bring you very close to goodness. He makes your reward to be forgiveness of your sins and fine dwellings in paradise of Eden. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Allah certainly loves those who fight for His cause and stand firm as solid and strong structures.” (61:4) ‘You must form yourselves in straight lines like solid and strong structures. Allow those with coats of arms to be in front and those without it to be the next. You must fix your back-teeth against each other; it makes the sword strike harder on the head of the enemy. Launch your spears, they move swiftly. Look with a lower angle; it ties down excitement and relaxes the heart. Silence voices; it keeps failure away and it is better for dignity. You must not allow your banners to incline and you must not remove them. You must not allow anyone other than brave people to carry them. The defenders of what is very important, who can exercise patience in difficult conditions, deserve to be the protectors. You must not mutilate those who are killed, and when you reach the men of the enemy you must not expose privacies, you must not enter any house, you must not take anything of their properties except what you find with their army. You must not disturb any woman with mistreatment; and if they use bad words against your honor, men, virtuous ones among you, it is because they suffer from physical, psychological and intellectual weakness. We were ordered to hold our hands back from them and they were pagan women. If a man would take upon women this would remain a flaw in him and in his descendants after him. You must take notice, people capable of protecting important matters deserve to carry the banner to provide it protection and others walk on the sides, behind and in front of them, and they must not lose sight of it (the banner) and must not remain far behind nor must they go far ahead to become separated. I pray to Allah to grant blessings to one who cooperates with his brother (in faith) with his person. One should not leave his peer against his brother so that his peer and his brother fight. This brings regret and humiliation. This inevitably becomes his (enemy’s) fight against two people if he holds his hands back and has left his peer alone against his brother and has run away. He just looks to him and this one. If one does it he has angered Allah. You must not expose yourselves to the anger of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. “Running away does not benefit you even if you run away from death, or from being killed, because thereafter you will not benefit more than very little.” (33:16) I swear by Allah, if you run away from the swords nearby, you will not escape from the swords later on. You must seek help by exercising patience and truthfulness. Victory comes only after exercising patience. You must do Jihad for the cause of Allah, the way Jihad should be done and there is no power without Allah.’ “He (the Imam) (a.s.), passed by the banner of the people of al-Sham and found them holding their position. He said, ‘They will not move from their position without a blow which is hard and expels the soul out, and a blow that splits the skull, crushes the bones and makes the arms and the hands to fall off so that their forehead is crushed by the iron bars, their eyebrows scatter over their chest and chin. Where are people of patience and seekers of reward?’ A group of the Muslims marched to them. The right flank of this group returned back to the center and exposed those opposite to them. He (a.s.), moved forward until he reached them and said, ‘I saw your attack and retreat away from your positioned lines. It was your moving that provided a chance for the unjust and tyrants of al-Sham. You are the top most among Arab and the great peak, the beauty of the nights because of your recitations of the Holy Quran and the callers from among the people of the truth, while the sinners are lost. Were it not for your advance after your retreat and your regrouping after giving way to the enemy, you could have become subject to what those fleeing from the enemy during an advancing operation need to face for turning their backs to the enemy. I would find you of those being destroyed. My concerns are to a small degree reduced and my chest to a small degree is comforted. This happened when I saw you gain the ground over them as they had against you and you were able to remove them from their positions as they had done to you. I saw you strike them with your sword until their first line was toppled over the last line like the camel driven away. You must exercise patience. Comfort has come upon you and Allah has made you steadfast with certainty, so that the defeated notice that he is making his Lord angry. He hates his own self. In fleeing from the battle there is the anger of Allah, the inevitable humiliation, and a remaining stigma and destruction of ways of one’s living. There is no increase in the longevity of life of the fleeing person, no barrier between him and his day of death, and his Lord does not become happy with him. One’s death with truthfulness before achieving such characteristics is better than remaining with them and dwelling upon them.’ “In another of his speech he (a.s.), has said, ‘When you face these people (the enemy) tomorrow do not fight them before they attack you. When they attack you then rise against them. You must remain calm and dignified. You must fix your backside teeth against the teeth of opposite side. It delivers a harder hit on the skulls. Keep your eyes lower and look at the foreheads of the horses and the faces of men. Reduce your speech; it keeps failure and argumentations away. You must settle your souls up facing the enemy openly, to advance and to attack. You must remain steadfast and speak of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, very often. One who protects what is important in difficult times is of the protecting people who keep their banner on the side and others walk on its sides and in front. When you attack do it with such coordination as if it is one man’s attack. You must be protective; war is bitter. You must not allow them (enemy) to attack you after retreat or to advance to you after an unpredictable move. If one surrenders, accept it from him. Seek help from exercising patience; victory from Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, follows exercising patience. Allah’s servants will inherit the earth and the good end belongs to those who maintain piety before Allah.’” ",

Muhammad Bin Ali Bin Ma’mar, from Muhammad Bin Ali Bin Ukaayat Al-Tamimy, from Al-Husayn Bin Al-Nazar Al-Fahry, from Abu Amro Al-Awzaiy, from Amro Bin Shimr, from Jabir Bin Yazeed who said: ‘I came up to Abu Ja’far (asws), so I said, ‘O son (asws) of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), the differing among the Shiites in this Doctrine causes me pain’. He (asws) said: ‘O Jabir, shall I (asws) not suffice you with the meanings of their differences, from where they are differing, and from which perspective they are separating?’ I said, ‘Yes, O son (asws) of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj)’. He (asws) said: ‘So do not differ if they differ, O Jabir. The one who fights against the Master (asws) of the Era (Imam (asws) of his time) is like the one who has fought against the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) in his (saww) days. O Jabir, listen attentively’. I said, ‘As you (asws) like’. He (asws) said: ‘Listen attentively, and make it reach to wherever your ride takes you, that Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) preached to the People at Al-Medina, seven days after the passing away of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and that was when he (asws) was free from collecting the Quran and compiling it. He (asws) said: ‘Praise be to Allah (azwj) Who has Prevented the imaginations to grasp Him (azwj) except for His (azwj) Existence, and Veiled the intellects to think about His (azwj) Essence due to the restrictions of Him (azwj) having no similarities or images. But He (azwj) is the One in Whose Essence there are not differences nor any division into a number of parts due to the Perfection. He (azwj) is separate from the things, not due to being in a different place, and He (azwj) is in things, not being mixed within them, and He (azwj) Knows these, not by the use of tools. And He (azwj) is not Knowledgeable except by it, and there is nothing between Him (azwj) and His (azwj) Knowledge, any other knowledge. He (azwj) is the Knowledgeable by Himself (azwj). If it is said that He (azwj) was, it would be interpreted as the eternal existence, and if it is said that He (azwj) will never cease (to exist), it would be interpreted as the negation of the non-existence. He (azwj) is Glorious, and higher than the words of those who worship other than Him (azwj) and have taken a god other than Him (azwj). He (azwj) is Higher and Greater. We (asws) Praise Him (azwj) with a Praise of those of His (azwj) creatures who has Pleased Him (azwj), and He (azwj) has Made it to be more than Obligatory upon Himself (azwj) to Accept it. And I (asws) hereby testify that there is no God but Allah (azwj), One, with no Associates for Himself (azwj), and I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant and His (azwj) Messenger. These two testimonies elevate the words and increase the deeds. Light is the Scale from which these two are raised from, and heavy is the Scale on which these two are placed. And by these two is the victory of the Paradise, and the salvation from the Fire, and the Permission upon the (crossing of) the Bridge. And it is by the testimony that you will be entering the Paradise, and by the Prayers that you will be consuming the Mercy. Send the greetings frequently upon your Prophet (saww) “[33:56] Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation”. O you people! There is no nobility higher than Al-Islam, nor a prestige more honourable than the piety, nor a stronghold better than devoutness, nor an intercessor more excellent than repentance, nor a robe more majestic than good health, nor a protection more secure than safety, nor a wealth better at dispelling poverty than contentment with conviction/cetainity, nor a treasure more enriching than being satisfied. And the one lives at the subsistence level and the reduction in comfort, so he has made the preparations for the rest, and the desires is the key to the fatigue, and the monopolisation follows from affliction, and the jealousy is a scourge on the Religion, and the greed is an invitation to the indulgence in the sins and the reason for the deprivation, and the transgression is a driver to the destruction, and greed gathers all the defects. Perhaps a failed greed, a false hope leads to the dispossession and a business trade to incur a loss. The one who gets involved in the matters without looking at the consequences will be exposed to misfortunes, and the most evil of the collars (humiliation) for a Believer is the sin. O you people! There is no treasure more beneficial than the knowledge, and no honour higher than the forbearance, and no nobility more eloquent than the ethics, and no affliction greater than anger, and no majesty more decorative than the intellect, and nothing is more disgraceful than the lies, and no protection safer than silence, and no absentee which is nearer than the death. O you people! The one who looks at his own faults will be too pre-occupied to look at the faults of the others, and the one who is contented with the sustenance of Allah (azwj) will not despair upon what is in the hands of the others, and the one who unsheathes the sword of rebellion will be killed by it, and the one who drills a pit for his brother will fall into it himself, and the one who discloses the veiled (privacy) of others will uncover the privacy of his own house, and the one who forgets his own mistakes will magnify the mistakes of the others, and the one who wonders at his own opinion will go astray, and the one who considers himself to be needless due to his intellect will make mistakes, and the one who is arrogant to the people will be humiliated, and the one who is a fool to the people will be hated, and the one who mixes with the villains will be degraded, and the one who burdens himself with what he cannot endure will be frustrated. O you people! There is no wealth more valuable than the intellect, and no poverty which is more intense than the ignorance, and no preacher which is more profound than the sound advice, and no reasoning like the contemplation, and no worship like the pondering, and no demonstration more reliable than the consultation, and no isolation more severe than the self-conceit, nor piety like refraining from the Prohibitions, and no forbearance like patience and silence. O you people! In the human being there are ten qualities, which are revealed by his tongue and becomes witness to his hidden thoughts, it is a ruler by which he decides between what to be said, and the words by which he returns the answer, and an intercessor (limbs) by which he achieves the needs, and a describer (senses) by which he recognises the things, and a commander (decision) by which he commands for the good, and a preacher by which he prohibits from the ugly (deeds), and a consoler by which he gives solace to the sorrows, and a conscious by which he clears the malice, and an articulator by which he gives pleasure to the ears. O you people! There is no good in keeping silent about the ‘الْحُكْمِ’ (the Command) just as there is no good in speaking out of ignorance. And know, O you people, that the one who does not control his tongue will regret, and the one who does not learn will be ignorant, and the one who does not forbear will not content, and the one who is not deterred does not learn, and the one who does not know is insulted, and the one who is insulted is not respected, and the one who is not respected is taunted, and the one who acquires wealth from where he has no right to do so will spend it extravagantly in other that the right way, and the one who does not desist when he is praised will desist when he is condemned, and the one who does not give in comfort will also be refused when in the need, and the one who seeks the honour without being deserving of it will be disgraced, the one who overcomes with injustice will also be overpowered, and the one who opposed the truth will necessitate weakness for himself, and the one who ponders will be dignified, and the one who is arrogant will be belittled, and the one who is not good will not be praised. O you people! The death is (better) before the lowliness, and the endurance before the apathy, and the accounting before the Punishment, and the grave is better than the poverty, lowering the sight is better than looking at a great deal, and the time, a day is for you and a day against you. So if it is for you, do not be ungrateful, and if it is against you, observe patience. So with both of them you will be Examined. (And in another copy – ‘And with both of them you will be Tested’) O you people! The strangest of what is in the human being is his heart, and in it are matters of wisdom and the antibodies to the one who opposes it. When there is prosperity for him, greed humiliates him, and if greed excites him, the thriftiness destroys him, when despair overpowers him, the remorse kills him, and when the anger presents itself, the rage intensifies, and when he is happy and satisfied he forgets to conserve, and when fear seizes him he gets preoccupied by caution, and when security is widened for him his honour makes him complacent (and in another copy ‘pride takes him over’), and when new bounties come up for him pride takes him over, and when he is benefitted by money his richness makes him oppressive, and when poverty bites him he is preoccupied by the affliction (and in another copy ‘he strives in the weeping’), and when he is inflicted by hardship anxiety injures him, and when the hunger exhausts him he is disabled by the weakness, and when he over-eats he is upset by indigestion, so every deficiency is harmful to him, and every excess spoils him. O you people! The one who is miserly will be disgraced and the one who is generous will be the master, and the one who increases his wealth becomes the leader and the one who increases his forbearance becomes noble, and the one who ponders regarding the Essence of Allah (azwj) becomes an Atheist, and the one who frequents in something becomes known for it, and the one frequently jokes will be taken lightly, and the one who frequently laughs his prestige goes away, the one who has no ethics will corrupt. The best deed is the maintenance of honour by wealth. There is none who sits with the ignorant ones who is reasonable, for the one who sits with the ignorant ones should ready himself for (a lot of) talk (against him)’. And he (asws) said: ‘Neither did the rich one obtain salvation from death by his wealth, nor did the poor one due to his scarcity’. O you people! Had the death been (a commodity) which could be bought, the good and the honourable ones of the world, as well as the wicked and the greedy ones would have bought it. O you people! There are witnesses for the hearts which hold them back from being the people of excesses, and there is insight for the understanding, which alerts the self and caution it from the danger. And for the heart there are memories of desires, and the intellect admonishes and prohibits from it. And in the experiences there is an appellant, which is a reliable guide to the right way. It is sufficient for yourself what you would not like it to happen to others, and it is upon you that the same should be for your believing brother, and in it upon him, likewise. The one who considers his own opinion to be self-sufficing from him would endanger him, and the pondering before the deeds would keep you safe from remorse. And the one who welcomes different opinions would understand the places of mistakes. And the one who refrains from the useless matters his opinion would balance the intellects. The one who fortifies his carnal desires so he has kept his respect, and the one who restrains his tongue is trusted by the people and will achieve his needs. And in the alteration of the situations the jewels of the men become known, and the passing days make apparent the inner selves. And there is no enjoyment in the swiftness of lightning for the one who goes through darkness. And the one who is recognised by the wisdom, the eyes will notice him with reverence and prestige. The most noble of riches is the avoidance of wishes, and the patience is a shield against poverty, and the greed is a sign of poverty, and the stinginess is the gown of destitution, and the cordiality with the relatives is beneficial, and the sympathy of the poor is better than the disloyal rich. Counselling is like a cave for the one who listens to it, and the one who does not restrain his eyes, his regrets increase. And the (passage of) time has made it to be more than obligatory for the one who avails it, to thank it. The tongue does very little justice in displaying the ugly and the good. The one who constricts his ethics, his family get tired of him. And the one who seeks, achieves it for a long time, and very little of what is wished is sincere. Modesty clothes you with dignity, and in the extensiveness of the morals is a treasure for the sustenance, and how many from the people remain in their sins until the end of their days. And the one who robes himself with bashfulness as his clothing his faults are hidden from the people. And intend moderation in your speech, for the one who intends it will incur light expenses, and in the opposition to the ego is guidance for you. And the one who recognises the ‘days’ (his end) will never be oblivious from the preparation. Nay! Along with every sip (of drink) is (possibility of) choking, and in every morsel is (the possibility of) suffocation. Bounties cannot be achieved except by the decline of other (bounties), and for every breath is life, and for every grain is a consumer, and you are the morsel of the death. And know, O you people! The ones who walks upon the face of the earth will end up in its belly, and the nights and the days, they dispute (they accelerate) regarding the destruction of the life-span. O you people! Ingratitude for the bounties is wickedness, and the company of the ignorant is ominous. The softness of the speech is from the prestige. And from the (acts of) worship are displayed by the tongue (make it heard) and increase the greetings. Beware of deceit for it is from the manners of the villains. Every seeker does not get a share, nor does every absentee return. Its not certain that one will get what he wishes and the lost is recovered. Seek (the company) of friends before setting of and ensure (good) neighbourhood before (moving into) the house. Indeed! The one who moves fast will catche up with the slower ones. Conceal the private (matters) of your brother just as he knows regarding you. Forgive the mistakes of your friend for the day that your enemy comes to dominate you. The one who is angry with the one over whom he has no power to injure, his grief would be prolonged and it will punish his soul. The one who fears his Lord (azwj) will refrain from committing injustices. The one who is good with the words would display his pride. And the one who does not recognise the good from the evil, is like an animal. Indeed the corruption destroys the provisions (of the Hereafter). How little is the difficulty (of today) as compared with the great destitution tomorrow. Far it is! Far it is from being compared. And what is your antipathy due to, except for your indulgence in acts of disobedience and the sins. So how close is the rest to the tiredness, and the misery from the Bounties. The hardships are not painful after which there is the Paradise, and the goodtime is not the (lasting) comfort after which there is the Fire. And every bounty apart from the Paradise is insignificant, and every affliction apart from the Fire is healthy. And turning away from correcting the consciences leads to the major sins. Purification of the deeds is more difficult than the deed itself, and the sincerity of the intention from the corruption is more difficulty upon the performer of the deed than the lengthy Jihaad. Far it is! Had it not been for the piety I (asws) would have been the shrewdest of the Arabs. O you people! Allah (azwj) the High Promised His (azwj) Prophet (saww) Muhammad (saww) the Means (Al-Waseela), and His (azwj) Promise is True, and Allah (azwj) does not Go against His (azwj) Promise. Surely Al-Waseela is on the steps of the Paradise and is at the peak of the nearness (to Allah (azwj)), and is a total security at the very end of it. There are a thousand staircases, and what is in between one staircase and the other there is a travel distance by a fine horse of a hundred years. And in between these is a staircase of gems going up to a staircase of jewels, to a staircase of aquamarines, to a staircase of pearls, to a staircase of rubies, to a staircase of emeralds, to a staircase of corals, to a staircase of camphor, to a staircase of ambergris, to a staircase of aloe, to a staircase of gold, to a staircase of clouds, to a staircase of air, to a staircase of Light which encompasses all of the Gardens. And on that Day the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) would be seated wearing two Garments – a Garment of the Mercy of Allah (azwj) and a Garment of the Light of Allah (azwj). On him (saww) will be a Crown of the Prophet-hood and a Garland of the Message, the Light of which will illuminate the whole of the Pausing Place (Station in the Hereafter). And on that Day, I (asws) will be upon the High Level, and it will be lower than his (saww) Level, and on me (asws) would be two Garments – a Garment of purple Light and a Garment of Camphor. And the Messengers (as) and the Prophets (saww) would have paused upon my (asws) staircase, with the Flags of the Eras and the Proof of the ages on our (asws) right, and they (as) will have Majestic Garments of Light and the Prestige. There is no Angel of Proximity, and no Messenger Prophet (saww) who will look at us (asws) except that he will be stunned by our (asws) Light. And stranger than our (asws) Illumination and our (asws) Majesty is the Al-Waseela on our (asws) right, and on the right of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) will be a cloud stretching out as far as the eye can see. A Call will come out from it: ‘O people of the Pausing Place! Goodness is for the ones who loved the successor (asws) and believed in the Prophet (saww), the ‘Ummy’ of the Arabs. And the one who disbelieved, so the Fire is Prepared for him. And on the left of Al-Waseela, from the left of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) will be a shade. A Call will come out from it: ‘O people of the Pausing Place! Goodness is for the ones who loved the successor (asws) and believed in the ‘Ummy’ Prophet (saww), the one (saww) for whom is the High Kingdom. There is no success for anyone, nor happiness for the soul, and the Paradise except for the one who is meeting his Creator (azwj) with the sincerity for these two (asws) and the follower of the stars (Imams (asws)) from these two (asws). Be convinced, O people of Al-Wilayah of Allah (azwj), of the whitening of your faces, and the prestige of your seating, and the honour of your return and your success today, with bliss, facing each other. And O people of the deviation, and the diverters from Allah (azwj), Mighty is His (azwj) Remembrance, and from His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and from His (azwj) Path, and the Flags of the eras, be convinced of the blackening of your faces, and the Wrath of your Lord (azwj), a Recompense of what you used to do before. And there is none from the Messengers (as) who preceded and none from the Prophets (as) of the past except that he (as) had informed his (as) community of the Messenger (saww) to come after him (as), and the good news of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and bequeathed to his (as) community, and described him (saww) to his (as) community his (saww) qualities, and that they should follow him (saww) and be upon his (saww) Law, so that they would not stray with regards to him (saww) after him (as). So the ones who would face destruction and straying afterwards would only be after the occurrence of the reasons and the warnings, and having been acquainted with the evidence, and the arguments having been established. So the communities lived in hope about the Messengers (as) and the Prophets (as) to come, if they were in difficult circumstances in the absence of a Prophet (as) after their Prophet (as), in their great difficulties and disasters, so they were at the time in a state of hope. And there have never been a difficulty which was greater, and nor a disaster greater like the difficulties with the Messenger of Allah (saww), because Allah (azwj) Ended the Warnings, and the Reasons, and Cut-off through him (saww) the Arguments, and the Reasons between Him (azwj) and His (azwj) creatures, and Made him (saww) to be His (azwj) Door which was between Him (azwj) and His (azwj) servants, and as His (azwj) Authority which nothing would be Acceptable except by him (saww), nor any nearness to Him (azwj) except by being obedient to him (saww). And He (azwj) Said Decisively in His (azwj) Book: “[4:80] Whoever obeys the Messenger, he indeed obeys Allah and whoever turns back, so We have not sent you as a keeper over them”. So He (azwj) Joined obedience to Himself (azwj) with obedience to him (saww), and disobedience to Himself (azwj) with disobedience to him (saww). So that was the Evidence which was Delegated to him (saww), and a Testimony against the one who obeys him (saww), and disobeys him (saww), and between that in other places from the Great Book. So the Blessed and the High Said in the Incitement to follow him (saww), and the Exhortation with regards to his (saww) ratification, and the acceptance of his (saww) Call: “[3:31] Say, (O Muhammad, tell to mankind): If you love Allah, follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins”. So following him (saww) achieves the Love of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Pleasure, and the Forgiveness of the sins, and the completeness of the success, and the necessitation of the Paradise. And in the turning away from him (saww) achieves the Enmity of Allah (azwj), and His (azwj) Wrath, and His (azwj) Harshness, and remoteness from Him (azwj), and a dwelling in the Fire and that is His (azwj) Statement: “[11:17] and whoever of the (different) parties disbelieves in it, the Fire will be their promised meeting-place”, meaning the striving against him (saww) and disobedience to him (saww). Allah (azwj), Blessed is His (azwj) Name, Tested His (azwj) servants by me (asws), and killed those that opposed Him (azwj) by my (asws) hand, and annihilated those that strived against Him (azwj) by my (asws) sword, and Made me (asws) to be a Means of nearness to Him (azwj) (Zulfat) for the Believers, and a ground of death for the toughest tyrants, and His (azwj) Sword against the criminals, and Strengthened by me (asws) the back of His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and Honoured me (asws) by helping him (saww), and Privileged me (asws) with his (saww) knowledge, and Gifted me (asws) with his (saww) Laws, and Favoured me (asws) for his (saww) successorship, and Chose me (asws) for his (saww) Caliphate in his (saww) community. So he (saww) said when he (saww) mobilised the Emigrants and the Helpers in their gathering: ‘O you people! Surely, Ali (asws) is from me (saww) like Haroun (as) was from Musa (as) except that there is no Prophet (as) to come after me (saww). So the Believers understood that the Messenger (saww) was speaking on behalf of Allah (azwj). They recognised me (asws) that I (asws) was not his (saww) brother by his (saww) father (as) or his (saww) mother (as) as was the case with Haroun (saww) who was the brother of Musa (as) from his (as) father and his (as) mother (as), nor was I (asws) a Prophet (as). The Prophet-hood has ended. But, that was from him (saww) appointing me (asws) as the Caliph just as Musa (as) had appointed Haroun (as) as the Caliph when he (as) said: “[7:142] Take my place among my people, and act well and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers.” And his (saww) words when a group spoke saying, ‘We are the friends of the Messenger of Allah (azwj)’. So the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) went out to the Farewell Pilgrimage, then came up to Ghadeer Khumm. So he (saww) ordered for something resembling a Pulpit to be prepared to him (saww). Then he (saww) ascended it, grabbed my (asws) arm and raised it to the extent that the whiteness of his (saww) armpits were seen, and said in a raised voice in that forum: ‘The one to whom I (saww) was the Master of, so Ali (asws) is his Master. Our Allah (azwj)! Befriend the one who befriends him (asws), and be Inimical to the one who is an enemy to him (asws). Thus, upon my (asws) Wilayah is the Wilayah of Allah (azwj), and upon my (asws) enmity is the enmity against Allah (azwj). And Allah (azwj), Mighty and Majestic Revealed in that day: “[5:3] This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion”. So upon my (asws) Wilayah was the completion of the Religion, and the Pleasure of the Lord (azwj), Majestic is His (azwj) Remembrance. And Allah (azwj), Blessed and High, Revealed it especially for me (asws) and Honoured the Gifting it for me (asws) as (a sign of) greatness, and its gifting from the Messenger of Allah (saww), and it is the Statement of the High: “[6:62] Then are men returned unto Allah, their protector, the (only) reality: Is not His the command? and He is the swiftest in taking account.” If I (asws) were to mention my (asws) merits, its loftiness would be great, and it’s listening prolonged. And about me (asws), two miserable ones before me (asws) disputed with me (asws) regarding that in which they had no rights over it, and they rode its misguidance, and believed in the ignorance. So evil is what was to them, what they returned to, and evil is what they made as a cradle for themselves. They cursed each other in their own houses, and each one of them distanced himself from his companion saying to him when he met him, ‘Alas! If only there was the distance between the East and the West between me and between you’. So evil is the friend who answered him, the miserable one upon his ragged condition, “[25:28] O woe is me! would that I had not taken such a one for a friend. [25:29] He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan was ever man’s deserter in the hour of need”. So I (asws) am the Reminder from which he went astray, and the Way from which he deviated, and the Belief which he denied, and the Quran from which he fled, and the Religion which he belied, and the Path from which he digressed. And the debris which they lived upon in their constant pride, they were on it on the verge of the Fire (prepared) for them - an evil return amongst the wicked group, to a condemned destination. They will be shouting curses at each other grumbling in regret. There will be no rest for these two; nor a respite from their inevitable Punishment. The people never ceased to be the worshippers of the idols and being the custodians of the idols, establishing rituals for them, and designated certain offerings for them in order to seek nearness to them. And they made for them titles such as ‘Al-Baheyra, and Al-Waseyla, and Al-Sa’ebat, and Al-Haam’. They distributed these idols by casting lots by arrows, wondering about Allah (azwj) Mighty is His (azwj) Remembrance. They were confused about the guidance, hastening to the remoteness, and they had been overcome by Satan (la) who had flooded them with the darkness of ignorance, having breastfed them with ignorance and weaned them with misguidance. Allah (azwj) Brought us (asws) out to them as a Mercy, and Informed about us (asws) as being higher than them, and Removed the Veil of Light from us (asws) for those that sought us (asws), and Preferred the ones who followed it (the Light), and we (asws) were a support for the ones who ratified it. So honour followed after the disgrace, and the plenty after the scarcity. And their hearts and their eyes revered them, and the tyrants yielded to them, and its respective communities became the people of the Bounties, being worthy of mention, and prestigious, and ease, and security after fear, and ‘جَمْعٍ’ union after having been separated. And Ma’d Bin Adnan was illuminated (famous) due to us (asws) and we (asws) inserted them in the Door of Guidance, and we (asws) entered them into the House of Peace, and we (asws) clothed them with the garment of Belief, and they became famous due to us (asws) in the worlds, and the effects of the righteous people appeared for them in the days of the Messenger (saww), from a striving protector, and an obedient worshipper, and an ascetic retreater, and they preserved the trusts and became as such until when Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Called back His (azwj) Prophet (saww) and Raised him (saww) to Himself (azwj). That was not after him (saww) except like a moment of pulse, or a glimmer of lightning for them to return back and turn back upon their heels, and sought revenge by forming battalions, and they blocked the Door and destroyed the houses, and changed the effects of the Messenger of Allah (saww), and turned away from his (saww) rulings, and distanced themselves from his (saww) Light, and they changed his (saww) Caliph with an alternate. They took to him, and they were unjust in doing so, and they thought that the one whom they had chosen from the descendants of Abu Kohafa (Abu Bakr) is higher in status than the one (asws) whom the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) had chosen to be in his (saww) place, and that the Emigrants from the progeny of Abu Kohafa were better than the Emigrants and the Helpers of the Rabbi of the Law Hashim Bin Abd Manaf (as). Nay! The first false testimony which occurred in Al-Islam was their testimony that their companion (Abu Bakr) is the one whom the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) had made to be the Caliph. So when the matter of Sa’d Bin Ubada was what it was, they retracted from that and said that the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) passed away and did not appoint a Caliph. So the Messenger of Allah (saww), the good, the Blessed, was the first one in Al-Islam against who the false testimony was borne. And after a little while they found out the evil of what (they came to know and found out the consequences of the evil of what) the former ones had established. And they had an alternative and an opportunity to recover from the death, and had the time to turn around from the lure of pride, and be in a tranquil condition, and the realisation of the deeds. Allah (azwj) had respited Shaddaad Bin Aad, and Thamud Bin Abbuwad, and Bal’am Bin Ba’our, and Bestowed upon them His (azwj) Favours, both apparent as well as hidden, Supplied them with the wealth, and the (prolongation) of their lives, and Granted them the land, so that due to these Blessings they would Remember the Signs of Allah (azwj), and they would recognise and be awed by Him (azwj), and turn to Him (azwj), and bring an end to their arrogance. So before they reached their (allocated) time, and enjoy their meal, Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Grabbed them and cut them down. Some of them from sandstorm, some were overtaken by a scream, and some from being burned by the shadow, and some from the tremors, and some from sinking of the earth. Allah (azwj) was not Unjust to them, but they had been unjust to their own selves. Indeed! For every term there is a writing. So when the writing reaches its term, and it is uncovered for you about what would befall the unjust ones, and what the greatest losers have got to, you will run towards Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic from what they had been involved in and to what they are proceeding to. Nay! And I (asws) am among you, O you people, like Haroun (as) was in the people of the Pharaoh (la), and like the Door of Hitta in the Children of Israel, and like the Ark of Noah (as) in the people of Noah (as). I (asws) am the Great News (Al-Nabaa Al-Azeem), and the Great Truthful (Al-Siddique Al-Akbar), And after a little while you will come to know what had been Promised to you. And is this anything else but (was committed) for a morsel of food, and a sip of drink, light sleep. Then the disgrace will be necessitated upon them in the world, and on the Day of Judgement they will be returning to intense Punishment. And Allah (azwj) is not Oblivious (forgetful) of what they have done. So what is the Recompense for the one who turned away from His (azwj) Proof (asws), and denied His (azwj) Argument, and opposed His (azwj) Guides (asws), and turned away from His (azwj) Light and stormed (his way) into the darkness, and exchanged water for the mirage, and Bounties for the Punishment, and the success for the misery, and prosperity for the poverty, and the ease for the hardship. Nay! This is the Recompense of what they had sown and done before. So be certain of the Promise and of its reality, and be assured of what has been Promised on the Day of the coming of the ‘Scream’ (Dooms Day), with the Truth. “[50:42] The day when they shall hear the cry in truth; that is the day of coming forth. [50:43] Surely We give life and cause to die, and to Us is the eventuAl-coming [50:44] The day on which the earth shall cleave asunder under them, they will make haste; that is a gathering together easy to Us”.",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "4. Muhammad Bin Ali Bin Ma’mar, from Muhammad Bin Ali Bin Ukaayat Al-Tamimy, from Al-Husayn Bin Al-Nazar Al-Fahry, from Abu Amro Al-Awzaiy, from Amro Bin Shimr, from Jabir Bin Yazeed who said: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "‘I came up to Abu Ja’far (asws), so I said, ‘O son (asws) of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), the differing among the Shiites in this Doctrine causes me pain’. He (asws) said: ‘O Jabir, shall I (asws) not suffice you with the meanings of their differences, from where they are differing, and from which perspective they are separating?’ I said, ‘Yes, O son (asws) of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj)’. He (asws) said: ‘So do not differ if they differ, O Jabir. The one who fights against the Master (asws) of the Era (Imam (asws) of his time) is like the one who has fought against the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) in his (saww) days. O Jabir, listen attentively’. I said, ‘As you (asws) like’. He (asws) said: ‘Listen attentively, and make it reach to wherever your ride takes you, that Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) preached to the People at Al-Medina, seven days after the passing away of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and that was when he (asws) was free from collecting the Quran and compiling it. He (asws) said: ‘Praise be to Allah (azwj) Who has Prevented the imaginations to grasp Him (azwj) except for His (azwj) Existence, and Veiled the intellects to think about His (azwj) Essence due to the restrictions of Him (azwj) having no similarities or images. But He (azwj) is the One in Whose Essence there are not differences nor any division into a number of parts due to the Perfection. He (azwj) is separate from the things, not due to being in a different place, and He (azwj) is in things, not being mixed within them, and He (azwj) Knows these, not by the use of tools. And He (azwj) is not Knowledgeable except by it, and there is nothing between Him (azwj) and His (azwj) Knowledge, any other knowledge. He (azwj) is the Knowledgeable by Himself (azwj). If it is said that He (azwj) was, it would be interpreted as the eternal existence, and if it is said that He (azwj) will never cease (to exist), it would be interpreted as the negation of the non-existence. He (azwj) is Glorious, and higher than the words of those who worship other than Him (azwj) and have taken a god other than Him (azwj). He (azwj) is Higher and Greater. We (asws) Praise Him (azwj) with a Praise of those of His (azwj) creatures who has Pleased Him (azwj), and He (azwj) has Made it to be more than Obligatory upon Himself (azwj) to Accept it. And I (asws) hereby testify that there is no God but Allah (azwj), One, with no Associates for Himself (azwj), and I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant and His (azwj) Messenger. These two testimonies elevate the words and increase the deeds. Light is the Scale from which these two are raised from, and heavy is the Scale on which these two are placed. And by these two is the victory of the Paradise, and the salvation from the Fire, and the Permission upon the (crossing of) the Bridge. And it is by the testimony that you will be entering the Paradise, and by the Prayers that you will be consuming the Mercy. Send the greetings frequently upon your Prophet (saww) “[33:56] Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation”. O you people! There is no nobility higher than Al-Islam, nor a prestige more honourable than the piety, nor a stronghold better than devoutness, nor an intercessor more excellent than repentance, nor a robe more majestic than good health, nor a protection more secure than safety, nor a wealth better at dispelling poverty than contentment with conviction/cetainity, nor a treasure more enriching than being satisfied. And the one lives at the subsistence level and the reduction in comfort, so he has made the preparations for the rest, and the desires is the key to the fatigue, and the monopolisation follows from affliction, and the jealousy is a scourge on the Religion, and the greed is an invitation to the indulgence in the sins and the reason for the deprivation, and the transgression is a driver to the destruction, and greed gathers all the defects. Perhaps a failed greed, a false hope leads to the dispossession and a business trade to incur a loss. The one who gets involved in the matters without looking at the consequences will be exposed to misfortunes, and the most evil of the collars (humiliation) for a Believer is the sin. O you people! There is no treasure more beneficial than the knowledge, and no honour higher than the forbearance, and no nobility more eloquent than the ethics, and no affliction greater than anger, and no majesty more decorative than the intellect, and nothing is more disgraceful than the lies, and no protection safer than silence, and no absentee which is nearer than the death. O you people! The one who looks at his own faults will be too pre-occupied to look at the faults of the others, and the one who is contented with the sustenance of Allah (azwj) will not despair upon what is in the hands of the others, and the one who unsheathes the sword of rebellion will be killed by it, and the one who drills a pit for his brother will fall into it himself, and the one who discloses the veiled (privacy) of others will uncover the privacy of his own house, and the one who forgets his own mistakes will magnify the mistakes of the others, and the one who wonders at his own opinion will go astray, and the one who considers himself to be needless due to his intellect will make mistakes, and the one who is arrogant to the people will be humiliated, and the one who is a fool to the people will be hated, and the one who mixes with the villains will be degraded, and the one who burdens himself with what he cannot endure will be frustrated. O you people! There is no wealth more valuable than the intellect, and no poverty which is more intense than the ignorance, and no preacher which is more profound than the sound advice, and no reasoning like the contemplation, and no worship like the pondering, and no demonstration more reliable than the consultation, and no isolation more severe than the self-conceit, nor piety like refraining from the Prohibitions, and no forbearance like patience and silence. O you people! In the human being there are ten qualities, which are revealed by his tongue and becomes witness to his hidden thoughts, it is a ruler by which he decides between what to be said, and the words by which he returns the answer, and an intercessor (limbs) by which he achieves the needs, and a describer (senses) by which he recognises the things, and a commander (decision) by which he commands for the good, and a preacher by which he prohibits from the ugly (deeds), and a consoler by which he gives solace to the sorrows, and a conscious by which he clears the malice, and an articulator by which he gives pleasure to the ears. O you people! There is no good in keeping silent about the ‘الْحُكْمِ’ (the Command) just as there is no good in speaking out of ignorance. And know, O you people, that the one who does not control his tongue will regret, and the one who does not learn will be ignorant, and the one who does not forbear will not content, and the one who is not deterred does not learn, and the one who does not know is insulted, and the one who is insulted is not respected, and the one who is not respected is taunted, and the one who acquires wealth from where he has no right to do so will spend it extravagantly in other that the right way, and the one who does not desist when he is praised will desist when he is condemned, and the one who does not give in comfort will also be refused when in the need, and the one who seeks the honour without being deserving of it will be disgraced, the one who overcomes with injustice will also be overpowered, and the one who opposed the truth will necessitate weakness for himself, and the one who ponders will be dignified, and the one who is arrogant will be belittled, and the one who is not good will not be praised. O you people! The death is (better) before the lowliness, and the endurance before the apathy, and the accounting before the Punishment, and the grave is better than the poverty, lowering the sight is better than looking at a great deal, and the time, a day is for you and a day against you. So if it is for you, do not be ungrateful, and if it is against you, observe patience. So with both of them you will be Examined. (And in another copy – ‘And with both of them you will be Tested’) O you people! The strangest of what is in the human being is his heart, and in it are matters of wisdom and the antibodies to the one who opposes it. When there is prosperity for him, greed humiliates him, and if greed excites him, the thriftiness destroys him, when despair overpowers him, the remorse kills him, and when the anger presents itself, the rage intensifies, and when he is happy and satisfied he forgets to conserve, and when fear seizes him he gets preoccupied by caution, and when security is widened for him his honour makes him complacent (and in another copy ‘pride takes him over’), and when new bounties come up for him pride takes him over, and when he is benefitted by money his richness makes him oppressive, and when poverty bites him he is preoccupied by the affliction (and in another copy ‘he strives in the weeping’), and when he is inflicted by hardship anxiety injures him, and when the hunger exhausts him he is disabled by the weakness, and when he over-eats he is upset by indigestion, so every deficiency is harmful to him, and every excess spoils him. O you people! The one who is miserly will be disgraced and the one who is generous will be the master, and the one who increases his wealth becomes the leader and the one who increases his forbearance becomes noble, and the one who ponders regarding the Essence of Allah (azwj) becomes an Atheist, and the one who frequents in something becomes known for it, and the one frequently jokes will be taken lightly, and the one who frequently laughs his prestige goes away, the one who has no ethics will corrupt. The best deed is the maintenance of honour by wealth. There is none who sits with the ignorant ones who is reasonable, for the one who sits with the ignorant ones should ready himself for (a lot of) talk (against him)’. And he (asws) said: ‘Neither did the rich one obtain salvation from death by his wealth, nor did the poor one due to his scarcity’. O you people! Had the death been (a commodity) which could be bought, the good and the honourable ones of the world, as well as the wicked and the greedy ones would have bought it. O you people! There are witnesses for the hearts which hold them back from being the people of excesses, and there is insight for the understanding, which alerts the self and caution it from the danger. And for the heart there are memories of desires, and the intellect admonishes and prohibits from it. And in the experiences there is an appellant, which is a reliable guide to the right way. It is sufficient for yourself what you would not like it to happen to others, and it is upon you that the same should be for your believing brother, and in it upon him, likewise. The one who considers his own opinion to be self-sufficing from him would endanger him, and the pondering before the deeds would keep you safe from remorse. And the one who welcomes different opinions would understand the places of mistakes. And the one who refrains from the useless matters his opinion would balance the intellects. The one who fortifies his carnal desires so he has kept his respect, and the one who restrains his tongue is trusted by the people and will achieve his needs. And in the alteration of the situations the jewels of the men become known, and the passing days make apparent the inner selves. And there is no enjoyment in the swiftness of lightning for the one who goes through darkness. And the one who is recognised by the wisdom, the eyes will notice him with reverence and prestige. The most noble of riches is the avoidance of wishes, and the patience is a shield against poverty, and the greed is a sign of poverty, and the stinginess is the gown of destitution, and the cordiality with the relatives is beneficial, and the sympathy of the poor is better than the disloyal rich. Counselling is like a cave for the one who listens to it, and the one who does not restrain his eyes, his regrets increase. And the (passage of) time has made it to be more than obligatory for the one who avails it, to thank it. The tongue does very little justice in displaying the ugly and the good. The one who constricts his ethics, his family get tired of him. And the one who seeks, achieves it for a long time, and very little of what is wished is sincere. Modesty clothes you with dignity, and in the extensiveness of the morals is a treasure for the sustenance, and how many from the people remain in their sins until the end of their days. And the one who robes himself with bashfulness as his clothing his faults are hidden from the people. And intend moderation in your speech, for the one who intends it will incur light expenses, and in the opposition to the ego is guidance for you. And the one who recognises the ‘days’ (his end) will never be oblivious from the preparation. Nay! Along with every sip (of drink) is (possibility of) choking, and in every morsel is (the possibility of) suffocation. Bounties cannot be achieved except by the decline of other (bounties), and for every breath is life, and for every grain is a consumer, and you are the morsel of the death. And know, O you people! The ones who walks upon the face of the earth will end up in its belly, and the nights and the days, they dispute (they accelerate) regarding the destruction of the life-span. O you people! Ingratitude for the bounties is wickedness, and the company of the ignorant is ominous. The softness of the speech is from the prestige. And from the (acts of) worship are displayed by the tongue (make it heard) and increase the greetings. Beware of deceit for it is from the manners of the villains. Every seeker does not get a share, nor does every absentee return. Its not certain that one will get what he wishes and the lost is recovered. Seek (the company) of friends before setting of and ensure (good) neighbourhood before (moving into) the house. Indeed! The one who moves fast will catche up with the slower ones. Conceal the private (matters) of your brother just as he knows regarding you. Forgive the mistakes of your friend for the day that your enemy comes to dominate you. The one who is angry with the one over whom he has no power to injure, his grief would be prolonged and it will punish his soul. The one who fears his Lord (azwj) will refrain from committing injustices. The one who is good with the words would display his pride. And the one who does not recognise the good from the evil, is like an animal. Indeed the corruption destroys the provisions (of the Hereafter). How little is the difficulty (of today) as compared with the great destitution tomorrow. Far it is! Far it is from being compared. And what is your antipathy due to, except for your indulgence in acts of disobedience and the sins. So how close is the rest to the tiredness, and the misery from the Bounties. The hardships are not painful after which there is the Paradise, and the goodtime is not the (lasting) comfort after which there is the Fire. And every bounty apart from the Paradise is insignificant, and every affliction apart from the Fire is healthy. And turning away from correcting the consciences leads to the major sins. Purification of the deeds is more difficult than the deed itself, and the sincerity of the intention from the corruption is more difficulty upon the performer of the deed than the lengthy Jihaad. Far it is! Had it not been for the piety I (asws) would have been the shrewdest of the Arabs. O you people! Allah (azwj) the High Promised His (azwj) Prophet (saww) Muhammad (saww) the Means (Al-Waseela), and His (azwj) Promise is True, and Allah (azwj) does not Go against His (azwj) Promise. Surely Al-Waseela is on the steps of the Paradise and is at the peak of the nearness (to Allah (azwj)), and is a total security at the very end of it. There are a thousand staircases, and what is in between one staircase and the other there is a travel distance by a fine horse of a hundred years. And in between these is a staircase of gems going up to a staircase of jewels, to a staircase of aquamarines, to a staircase of pearls, to a staircase of rubies, to a staircase of emeralds, to a staircase of corals, to a staircase of camphor, to a staircase of ambergris, to a staircase of aloe, to a staircase of gold, to a staircase of clouds, to a staircase of air, to a staircase of Light which encompasses all of the Gardens. And on that Day the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) would be seated wearing two Garments – a Garment of the Mercy of Allah (azwj) and a Garment of the Light of Allah (azwj). On him (saww) will be a Crown of the Prophet-hood and a Garland of the Message, the Light of which will illuminate the whole of the Pausing Place (Station in the Hereafter). And on that Day, I (asws) will be upon the High Level, and it will be lower than his (saww) Level, and on me (asws) would be two Garments – a Garment of purple Light and a Garment of Camphor. And the Messengers (as) and the Prophets (saww) would have paused upon my (asws) staircase, with the Flags of the Eras and the Proof of the ages on our (asws) right, and they (as) will have Majestic Garments of Light and the Prestige. There is no Angel of Proximity, and no Messenger Prophet (saww) who will look at us (asws) except that he will be stunned by our (asws) Light. And stranger than our (asws) Illumination and our (asws) Majesty is the Al-Waseela on our (asws) right, and on the right of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) will be a cloud stretching out as far as the eye can see. A Call will come out from it: ‘O people of the Pausing Place! Goodness is for the ones who loved the successor (asws) and believed in the Prophet (saww), the ‘Ummy’ of the Arabs. And the one who disbelieved, so the Fire is Prepared for him. And on the left of Al-Waseela, from the left of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) will be a shade. A Call will come out from it: ‘O people of the Pausing Place! Goodness is for the ones who loved the successor (asws) and believed in the ‘Ummy’ Prophet (saww), the one (saww) for whom is the High Kingdom. There is no success for anyone, nor happiness for the soul, and the Paradise except for the one who is meeting his Creator (azwj) with the sincerity for these two (asws) and the follower of the stars (Imams (asws)) from these two (asws). Be convinced, O people of Al-Wilayah of Allah (azwj), of the whitening of your faces, and the prestige of your seating, and the honour of your return and your success today, with bliss, facing each other. And O people of the deviation, and the diverters from Allah (azwj), Mighty is His (azwj) Remembrance, and from His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and from His (azwj) Path, and the Flags of the eras, be convinced of the blackening of your faces, and the Wrath of your Lord (azwj), a Recompense of what you used to do before. And there is none from the Messengers (as) who preceded and none from the Prophets (as) of the past except that he (as) had informed his (as) community of the Messenger (saww) to come after him (as), and the good news of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and bequeathed to his (as) community, and described him (saww) to his (as) community his (saww) qualities, and that they should follow him (saww) and be upon his (saww) Law, so that they would not stray with regards to him (saww) after him (as). So the ones who would face destruction and straying afterwards would only be after the occurrence of the reasons and the warnings, and having been acquainted with the evidence, and the arguments having been established. So the communities lived in hope about the Messengers (as) and the Prophets (as) to come, if they were in difficult circumstances in the absence of a Prophet (as) after their Prophet (as), in their great difficulties and disasters, so they were at the time in a state of hope. And there have never been a difficulty which was greater, and nor a disaster greater like the difficulties with the Messenger of Allah (saww), because Allah (azwj) Ended the Warnings, and the Reasons, and Cut-off through him (saww) the Arguments, and the Reasons between Him (azwj) and His (azwj) creatures, and Made him (saww) to be His (azwj) Door which was between Him (azwj) and His (azwj) servants, and as His (azwj) Authority which nothing would be Acceptable except by him (saww), nor any nearness to Him (azwj) except by being obedient to him (saww). And He (azwj) Said Decisively in His (azwj) Book: “[4:80] Whoever obeys the Messenger, he indeed obeys Allah and whoever turns back, so We have not sent you as a keeper over them”. So He (azwj) Joined obedience to Himself (azwj) with obedience to him (saww), and disobedience to Himself (azwj) with disobedience to him (saww). So that was the Evidence which was Delegated to him (saww), and a Testimony against the one who obeys him (saww), and disobeys him (saww), and between that in other places from the Great Book. So the Blessed and the High Said in the Incitement to follow him (saww), and the Exhortation with regards to his (saww) ratification, and the acceptance of his (saww) Call: “[3:31] Say, (O Muhammad, tell to mankind): If you love Allah, follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins”. So following him (saww) achieves the Love of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Pleasure, and the Forgiveness of the sins, and the completeness of the success, and the necessitation of the Paradise. And in the turning away from him (saww) achieves the Enmity of Allah (azwj), and His (azwj) Wrath, and His (azwj) Harshness, and remoteness from Him (azwj), and a dwelling in the Fire and that is His (azwj) Statement: “[11:17] and whoever of the (different) parties disbelieves in it, the Fire will be their promised meeting-place”, meaning the striving against him (saww) and disobedience to him (saww). Allah (azwj), Blessed is His (azwj) Name, Tested His (azwj) servants by me (asws), and killed those that opposed Him (azwj) by my (asws) hand, and annihilated those that strived against Him (azwj) by my (asws) sword, and Made me (asws) to be a Means of nearness to Him (azwj) (Zulfat) for the Believers, and a ground of death for the toughest tyrants, and His (azwj) Sword against the criminals, and Strengthened by me (asws) the back of His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and Honoured me (asws) by helping him (saww), and Privileged me (asws) with his (saww) knowledge, and Gifted me (asws) with his (saww) Laws, and Favoured me (asws) for his (saww) successorship, and Chose me (asws) for his (saww) Caliphate in his (saww) community. So he (saww) said when he (saww) mobilised the Emigrants and the Helpers in their gathering: ‘O you people! Surely, Ali (asws) is from me (saww) like Haroun (as) was from Musa (as) except that there is no Prophet (as) to come after me (saww). So the Believers understood that the Messenger (saww) was speaking on behalf of Allah (azwj). They recognised me (asws) that I (asws) was not his (saww) brother by his (saww) father (as) or his (saww) mother (as) as was the case with Haroun (saww) who was the brother of Musa (as) from his (as) father and his (as) mother (as), nor was I (asws) a Prophet (as). The Prophet-hood has ended. But, that was from him (saww) appointing me (asws) as the Caliph just as Musa (as) had appointed Haroun (as) as the Caliph when he (as) said: “[7:142] Take my place among my people, and act well and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers.” And his (saww) words when a group spoke saying, ‘We are the friends of the Messenger of Allah (azwj)’. So the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) went out to the Farewell Pilgrimage, then came up to Ghadeer Khumm. So he (saww) ordered for something resembling a Pulpit to be prepared to him (saww). Then he (saww) ascended it, grabbed my (asws) arm and raised it to the extent that the whiteness of his (saww) armpits were seen, and said in a raised voice in that forum: ‘The one to whom I (saww) was the Master of, so Ali (asws) is his Master. Our Allah (azwj)! Befriend the one who befriends him (asws), and be Inimical to the one who is an enemy to him (asws). Thus, upon my (asws) Wilayah is the Wilayah of Allah (azwj), and upon my (asws) enmity is the enmity against Allah (azwj). And Allah (azwj), Mighty and Majestic Revealed in that day: “[5:3] This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion”. So upon my (asws) Wilayah was the completion of the Religion, and the Pleasure of the Lord (azwj), Majestic is His (azwj) Remembrance. And Allah (azwj), Blessed and High, Revealed it especially for me (asws) and Honoured the Gifting it for me (asws) as (a sign of) greatness, and its gifting from the Messenger of Allah (saww), and it is the Statement of the High: “[6:62] Then are men returned unto Allah, their protector, the (only) reality: Is not His the command? and He is the swiftest in taking account.” If I (asws) were to mention my (asws) merits, its loftiness would be great, and it’s listening prolonged. And about me (asws), two miserable ones before me (asws) disputed with me (asws) regarding that in which they had no rights over it, and they rode its misguidance, and believed in the ignorance. So evil is what was to them, what they returned to, and evil is what they made as a cradle for themselves. They cursed each other in their own houses, and each one of them distanced himself from his companion saying to him when he met him, ‘Alas! If only there was the distance between the East and the West between me and between you’. So evil is the friend who answered him, the miserable one upon his ragged condition, “[25:28] O woe is me! would that I had not taken such a one for a friend. [25:29] He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan was ever man’s deserter in the hour of need”. So I (asws) am the Reminder from which he went astray, and the Way from which he deviated, and the Belief which he denied, and the Quran from which he fled, and the Religion which he belied, and the Path from which he digressed. And the debris which they lived upon in their constant pride, they were on it on the verge of the Fire (prepared) for them - an evil return amongst the wicked group, to a condemned destination. They will be shouting curses at each other grumbling in regret. There will be no rest for these two; nor a respite from their inevitable Punishment. The people never ceased to be the worshippers of the idols and being the custodians of the idols, establishing rituals for them, and designated certain offerings for them in order to seek nearness to them. And they made for them titles such as ‘Al-Baheyra, and Al-Waseyla, and Al-Sa’ebat, and Al-Haam’. They distributed these idols by casting lots by arrows, wondering about Allah (azwj) Mighty is His (azwj) Remembrance. They were confused about the guidance, hastening to the remoteness, and they had been overcome by Satan (la) who had flooded them with the darkness of ignorance, having breastfed them with ignorance and weaned them with misguidance. Allah (azwj) Brought us (asws) out to them as a Mercy, and Informed about us (asws) as being higher than them, and Removed the Veil of Light from us (asws) for those that sought us (asws), and Preferred the ones who followed it (the Light), and we (asws) were a support for the ones who ratified it. So honour followed after the disgrace, and the plenty after the scarcity. And their hearts and their eyes revered them, and the tyrants yielded to them, and its respective communities became the people of the Bounties, being worthy of mention, and prestigious, and ease, and security after fear, and ‘جَمْعٍ’ union after having been separated. And Ma’d Bin Adnan was illuminated (famous) due to us (asws) and we (asws) inserted them in the Door of Guidance, and we (asws) entered them into the House of Peace, and we (asws) clothed them with the garment of Belief, and they became famous due to us (asws) in the worlds, and the effects of the righteous people appeared for them in the days of the Messenger (saww), from a striving protector, and an obedient worshipper, and an ascetic retreater, and they preserved the trusts and became as such until when Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Called back His (azwj) Prophet (saww) and Raised him (saww) to Himself (azwj). That was not after him (saww) except like a moment of pulse, or a glimmer of lightning for them to return back and turn back upon their heels, and sought revenge by forming battalions, and they blocked the Door and destroyed the houses, and changed the effects of the Messenger of Allah (saww), and turned away from his (saww) rulings, and distanced themselves from his (saww) Light, and they changed his (saww) Caliph with an alternate. They took to him, and they were unjust in doing so, and they thought that the one whom they had chosen from the descendants of Abu Kohafa (Abu Bakr) is higher in status than the one (asws) whom the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) had chosen to be in his (saww) place, and that the Emigrants from the progeny of Abu Kohafa were better than the Emigrants and the Helpers of the Rabbi of the Law Hashim Bin Abd Manaf (as). Nay! The first false testimony which occurred in Al-Islam was their testimony that their companion (Abu Bakr) is the one whom the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) had made to be the Caliph. So when the matter of Sa’d Bin Ubada was what it was, they retracted from that and said that the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) passed away and did not appoint a Caliph. So the Messenger of Allah (saww), the good, the Blessed, was the first one in Al-Islam against who the false testimony was borne. And after a little while they found out the evil of what (they came to know and found out the consequences of the evil of what) the former ones had established. And they had an alternative and an opportunity to recover from the death, and had the time to turn around from the lure of pride, and be in a tranquil condition, and the realisation of the deeds. Allah (azwj) had respited Shaddaad Bin Aad, and Thamud Bin Abbuwad, and Bal’am Bin Ba’our, and Bestowed upon them His (azwj) Favours, both apparent as well as hidden, Supplied them with the wealth, and the (prolongation) of their lives, and Granted them the land, so that due to these Blessings they would Remember the Signs of Allah (azwj), and they would recognise and be awed by Him (azwj), and turn to Him (azwj), and bring an end to their arrogance. So before they reached their (allocated) time, and enjoy their meal, Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Grabbed them and cut them down. Some of them from sandstorm, some were overtaken by a scream, and some from being burned by the shadow, and some from the tremors, and some from sinking of the earth. Allah (azwj) was not Unjust to them, but they had been unjust to their own selves. Indeed! For every term there is a writing. So when the writing reaches its term, and it is uncovered for you about what would befall the unjust ones, and what the greatest losers have got to, you will run towards Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic from what they had been involved in and to what they are proceeding to. Nay! And I (asws) am among you, O you people, like Haroun (as) was in the people of the Pharaoh (la), and like the Door of Hitta in the Children of Israel, and like the Ark of Noah (as) in the people of Noah (as). I (asws) am the Great News (Al-Nabaa Al-Azeem), and the Great Truthful (Al-Siddique Al-Akbar), And after a little while you will come to know what had been Promised to you. And is this anything else but (was committed) for a morsel of food, and a sip of drink, light sleep. Then the disgrace will be necessitated upon them in the world, and on the Day of Judgement they will be returning to intense Punishment. And Allah (azwj) is not Oblivious (forgetful) of what they have done. So what is the Recompense for the one who turned away from His (azwj) Proof (asws), and denied His (azwj) Argument, and opposed His (azwj) Guides (asws), and turned away from His (azwj) Light and stormed (his way) into the darkness, and exchanged water for the mirage, and Bounties for the Punishment, and the success for the misery, and prosperity for the poverty, and the ease for the hardship. Nay! This is the Recompense of what they had sown and done before. So be certain of the Promise and of its reality, and be assured of what has been Promised on the Day of the coming of the ‘Scream’ (Dooms Day), with the Truth. “[50:42] The day when they shall hear the cry in truth; that is the day of coming forth. [50:43] Surely We give life and cause to die, and to Us is the eventuAl-coming [50:44] The day on which the earth shall cleave asunder under them, they will make haste; that is a gathering together easy to Us”.",

    "englishText": "40-21 Ahmad ibn Ziyad ibn Ja’far al-Hamadani - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashem quoted on the authority of Al-Rayyan ibn al-Salt, “Those of the people from the public or the soldiers who pledged allegiance to Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.), but were not, pleased to do so said, ‘This is one of the plans of Thul-Riasatayn Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl.’ This was told to Al-Ma’mun. Then he sent for me at midnight. I went to him. He said to me, ‘O Rayyan! I have been informed that the people say that the pledge of allegiance to Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) was one of the plans of Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl.’ I told him, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! So they say.’ He said, ‘O Rayyan! Woe be to you! Does anyonedare to suggest to a Caliph - born of a Caliph - who possesses the rule (to whom all the people and the troops are obedient), to turn his rule over to someone else with his own hands? Does the intellect allow this?’ I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! By God! No one dares to do that.’ Al-Ma’mun said, ‘No, it is not as they say, however, I will tell you the reason. When my brother Muhammad ordered me to go to him, I refused to do so. He issued an order to Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan to arrest me and place a yoke around my neck. I was informed about this order. I dispatched Harthama ibn A’yan to Sejistan, Kerman and its suburbs. He did not properly manage this affair and was defeated. The governor of Sarir rebelled and captured one of the regions of Khorasan. All this happened within one week. When this happened, I did not have the power to resist. I did not have any wealth either to get some power. I saw nothing but fear and cowardliness in my troops. I decided to seek refuge with the king of Kabul (in Afghanistan) who was a pagan. But then It occurred to me that if my brother Muhammad sends some money for him in return for me, the King might turn me over to him since he is an atheist. I found no better way than to repent to God the Highest of my sins, seek His assistance regarding these affairs, and seek refuge with God the Highest. Then I ordered that they clean this house - (as he pointed to a room). They cleaned it. I made ablutions with water, put on white pants and a smock and said four units of prayers in which I recited whatever of the Qur’an I knew. I prayed to God the Highest, sought refuge in Him, and sincerely made a strong covenant with Him to return the right to its true place and to turn over the Divine Leadership to its proper owner whom God has set - if He helps me overcome these difficulties. Then I calmed down. I sent Tahir towards Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan. With him things went on as I mentioned before. Again I sent Harthama ibn A’yan to defeat Rafi’. He defeated him and killed him. I invited the governor of Sarir to make peace and sent him gifts. I treated him with kindness until he quit opposing me. I got stronger and stronger until what happened to (my brother) Muhammad happened. And God the Highest turned all the affairs over to me and I was in power. Since God the Highest had fulfilled what I had asked Him for, and I wanted to honor my covenant with God, I saw that no one but Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) deserved the right to be in charge. That is why I offered the rule to him, but he refused. Then he accepted it in the way that you know of. This was the reason.’ Then I (Rayyan) said, ‘May God make theCommander of the Faithful successful!’ He said, ‘O Ray’yan! When the morning comes and the people come out, go among the army heads and tell them about the nobilities of the Commander of the Faithful - Ali ibn Abi Talib (a.s.).’ I told him, ‘I know nothing about him except for what I have heard from you. Should I just restate that?’ He said, “Glory be to God! I find no one to help me in this affair. I considered the people of Qum to be trustworthy.’ I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Should I tell them the traditions that I have heard from you?’ He said, ‘Yes. Tell them about the nobilities of Ali (a.s.) that you have heard from me.’ When the morning came, I went amongst the army heads and said, ‘The Commander of the Faithful has narrated that his father quoted on the authority of his forefathers, on the authority of God’s Prophet (S): ‘Whoever I am the master of, Ali is the master of.’ The Commander of the Faithful has narrated that his father quoted (the following) on the authority of his forefathers, on the authority of God’s Prophet (S): ‘The position of Ali relative to me is similar to that of Aaron to Moses.’ I did not remember the traditions exactly and made some mistakes. I narrated the tradition about Khaybar and other well-known traditions.’” Then Abdullah ibn Malik al-Khoza’ee said, “May God have Mercy upon Ali. He was a good man.” Al-Ma’mun had sent a servant to our meeting to hear what we said and report it to him. Then he sent someone after me. When I went there and he saw me, he said, “O Rayyan! You know many traditions by heart. I was informed about what that Jew, Abdullah ibn Malik, said, ‘May God have Mercy upon Ali. He was a good man.’ By God! I will kill him - God willing.”Hisham ibn Ibrahim al-Rashedi al-Hamadani was one of Ar-Ridha’’s (a.s.) especial people before Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) was brought (to Khorasan). He was an intelligent and well-versed scholar. He was in charge of the affairs of Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.). Whatever was brought in from the different areas was first handed to him, before the taking of Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) to Khorasan. Then, after they brought Abul Hassan (a.s.) to Khorasan, Ibrahim joined Thul-Riasatayn. Thul-Riasatayn established him as one of his closest workers. He used to report the news about Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) to Thul-Riasatayn and Al-Ma’mun. That is how he got closer to them, and nothing was hidden from them. Al-Ma’mun made him the main guard for Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.). He did not let anyone visit Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.), if he himself did not approve of it. He made things terribly difficult for Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) in his house. No one could talk tohim without the consent of Thul-Riasatayn and Al-Ma’mun. Al-Ma’mun entrusted his son - Al-Abbas to Hisham to train. That is why he was called Abbasid Hisham. Thul-Riasatayn made his real animosity with Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) apparent, because Al-Ma’mun respected the Imam (a.s.) more than him.Al-Ma’mun had a nephew whom he loved, and she also loved him. They had thus opened a door from her house to Al-Ma’mun’s court. That nephew was more inclined towards Abil Hassan (a.s.), and used to gossip about Thul-Riasatayn with Al-Ma’mun. Thul-Riasatayn was informed about this. He went to Al-Ma’mun and said, “It is not proper for the Caliph that a door be opened to his court from the lady’s quarter. Al-Ma’mun had that door closed. It was a current practice for Al-Ma’mun to visit Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) one day, and the next day Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) went to see Al-Ma’mun. Abil Hassan’s residence was next to Al-Ma’mun’s. Once, when Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) entered Al-Ma’mun’s house and saw the shut door, he (a.s.) said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Why is this door shut?” He said, “This was Al-Fadhl’s idea. He did not like it (to be open).” Then Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said, “To God We belong and to Him is our return.” What does Al-Fadhl have to do with the Commander of the Faithful and his family?” He asked, “What do you think?” He (a.s.) replied, “Open it and let your nephew visit you. Do not accept what Al-Fadhl forbids or allows.” Then Al-Ma’mun ordered that the door be re-opened and let his nephew enter. Al-Fadhl heard this and became sad.",

    "thaqalaynMatn": "“Those of the people from the public or the soldiers who pledged allegiance to Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.), but were not, pleased to do so said, ‘This is one of the plans of Thul-Riasatayn Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl.’ This was told to Al-Ma’mun.

When my brother Muhammad ordered me to go to him, I refused to do so. He issued an order to Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan to arrest me and place a yoke around my neck. I was informed about this order. I dispatched Harthama ibn A’yan to Sejistan, Kerman and its suburbs. He did not properly manage this affair and was defeated. The governor of Sarir rebelled and captured one of the regions of Khorasan. All this happened within one week. When this happened, I did not have the power to resist. I did not have any wealth either to get some power. I saw nothing but fear and cowardliness in my troops. I decided to seek refuge with the king of Kabul (in Afghanistan) who was a pagan. But then It occurred to me that if my brother Muhammad sends some money for him in return for me, the King might turn me over to him since he is an atheist. I found no better way than to repent to God the Highest of my sins, seek His assistance regarding these affairs, and seek refuge with God the Highest. Then I ordered that they clean this house - (as he pointed to a room). They cleaned it. I made ablutions with water, put on white pants and a smock and said four units of prayers in which I recited whatever of the Qur’an I knew. I prayed to God the Highest, sought refuge in Him, and sincerely made a strong covenant with Him to return the right to its true place and to turn over the Divine Leadership to its proper owner whom God has set - if He helps me overcome these difficulties. Then I calmed down. I sent Tahir towards Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan. With him things went on as I mentioned before. Again I sent Harthama ibn A’yan to defeat Rafi’. He defeated him and killed him. I invited the governor of Sarir to make peace and sent him gifts. I treated him with kindness until he quit opposing me. I got stronger and stronger until what happened to (my brother) Muhammad happened. And God the Highest turned all the affairs over to me and I was in power. Since God the Highest had fulfilled what I had asked Him for, and I wanted to honor my covenant with God, I saw that no one but Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) deserved the right to be in charge. That is why I offered the rule to him, but he refused. Then he accepted it in the way that you know of. This was the reason.’ Then I (Rayyan) said, ‘May God make theCommander of the Faithful successful!’ He said, ‘O Ray’yan! When the morning comes and the people come out, go among the army heads and tell them about the nobilities of the Commander of the Faithful - Ali ibn Abi Talib (a.s.).’ I told him, ‘I know nothing about him except for what I have heard from you. Should I just restate that?’ He said, “Glory be to God! I find no one to help me in this affair. I considered the people of Qum to be trustworthy.’ I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Should I tell them the traditions that I have heard from you?’ He said, ‘Yes. Tell them about the nobilities of Ali (a.s.) that you have heard from me.’ When the morning came, I went amongst the army heads and said, ‘The Commander of the Faithful has narrated that his father quoted on the authority of his forefathers, on the authority of God’s Prophet (S): ‘Whoever I am the master of, Ali is the master of.’ The Commander of the Faithful has narrated that his father quoted (the following) on the authority of his forefathers, on the authority of God’s Prophet (S): ‘The position of Ali relative to me is similar to that of Aaron to Moses.’ I did not remember the traditions exactly and made some mistakes. I narrated the tradition about Khaybar and other well-known traditions.’” Then Abdullah ibn Malik al-Khoza’ee said, “May God have Mercy upon Ali. He was a good man.” Al-Ma’mun had sent a servant to our meeting to hear what we said and report it to him. Then he sent someone after me. When I went there and he saw me, he said, “O Rayyan! You know many traditions by heart. I was informed about what that Jew, Abdullah ibn Malik, said, ‘May God have Mercy upon Ali. He was a good man.’ By God! I will kill him - God willing.”Hisham ibn Ibrahim al-Rashedi al-Hamadani was one of Ar-Ridha’’s (a.s.) especial people before Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) was brought (to Khorasan). He was an intelligent and well-versed scholar. He was in charge of the affairs of Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.). Whatever was brought in from the different areas was first handed to him, before the taking of Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) to Khorasan. Then, after they brought Abul Hassan (a.s.) to Khorasan, Ibrahim joined Thul-Riasatayn. Thul-Riasatayn established him as one of his closest workers. He used to report the news about Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) to Thul-Riasatayn and Al-Ma’mun. That is how he got closer to them, and nothing was hidden from them. Al-Ma’mun made him the main guard for Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.). He did not let anyone visit Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.), if he himself did not approve of it. He made things terribly difficult for Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) in his house. No one could talk tohim without the consent of Thul-Riasatayn and Al-Ma’mun. Al-Ma’mun entrusted his son - Al-Abbas to Hisham to train. That is why he was called Abbasid Hisham. Thul-Riasatayn made his real animosity with Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) apparent, because Al-Ma’mun respected the Imam (a.s.) more than him.Al-Ma’mun had a nephew whom he loved, and she also loved him. They had thus opened a door from her house to Al-Ma’mun’s court. That nephew was more inclined towards Abil Hassan (a.s.), and used to gossip about Thul-Riasatayn with Al-Ma’mun. Thul-Riasatayn was informed about this. He went to Al-Ma’mun and said, “It is not proper for the Caliph that a door be opened to his court from the lady’s quarter. Al-Ma’mun had that door closed. It was a current practice for Al-Ma’mun to visit Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) one day, and the next day Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) went to see Al-Ma’mun. Abil Hassan’s residence was next to Al-Ma’mun’s. Once, when Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) entered Al-Ma’mun’s house and saw the shut door, he (a.s.) said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Why is this door shut?” He said, “This was Al-Fadhl’s idea. He did not like it (to be open).” Then Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) said, “To God We belong and to Him is our return.” What does Al-Fadhl have to do with the Commander of the Faithful and his family?” He asked, “What do you think?” He (a.s.) replied, “Open it and let your nephew visit you. Do not accept what Al-Fadhl forbids or allows.” Then Al-Ma’mun ordered that the door be re-opened and let his nephew enter. Al-Fadhl heard this and became sad.",

    "englishText": "40-22 In some of the manuscripts of the book Al-Hiba wal-Shart, I found some traditions regarding Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.), the government officials, Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl and his brother. No one, however, granted me permission to quote directly from that book. However, in the following I will present what I have read in that book:And next, praise be to God - the Initiator; the Innovator; the Able; the Subduer; the Watcher of His servants; the Nourisher of all His creatures; to whose Kingdom all things humble themselves; to whose Glory all things yield; to whose Power all things submit; to whose Sovereignty and Greatness all things humble themselves; whose Knowledge encompasses all things and cannot be enumerated; to whom no great person can present himself; and from whose Sight no small person is missed; the One whom the eyes of the viewers cannot see; and the One who cannotbe described by the ones who describe; to Him belongs creating and the rule; and He is the Most Exalted example in the heavens and the Earth. He is Honorable and Wise.And praise be to God who established Islam as our religion. Then He made it noble, great, honored, and respected. He established it as a stable religion that cannot be changed, and as a straight path that directs whoever trots on it not going astray, and whoever abandons it will not be guided. He established light, reasoning, healing and form in it. He sent it down by means of His chosen angels to whomever He chose for Prophethood from the nations which have now gone and made room for others until the Prophethood ended with the appointment of Muhammad al-Mustafa (a.s.). He ended the Prophethood’s mission with Muhammad and with him ended the messages of the Prophets. And He appointed him due to His Mercy encompassing the people of the Two Worlds; and as one to give glad tidings to the honest believers; and to admonish the lying pagans. This He did to perfect His Proof for the people so that whoever is to be ruined after Truth has become apparent is ruined, and whoever is to survive after Truth has become apparent survives. Indeed God Sees and Knows. And praise be to God who granted the inheritance of the Prophets to the members of his (i.e. Muhammad’s) Holy Household, entrusted them with knowledge and wisdom, established them as the treasury of Divine Leadership and Rule, and made it incumbent (upon all) to love them and hold high their ranks. Then He ordered His Prophet (S) to ask his nation to love them when he said, ‘No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin’ And the way they were described as being pure and immaculate (a.s.potless) can be seen in His words, ‘And God only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless.’And next, Al-Ma’mun treated the ‘Itra of God’s Prophet (S) with reverence. Al-Ma’mun established the ties of kinship of his Holy Household which had been broken. He returned the family’s affection for each other, and ended their disunion. He bridged the gap that had developed amongst them. Thus, God totally eliminated their animosities and fostered co-existence instead. And now due to his blessedness, care, freedom, and re-establishing family relationships all the hands have become united into one hand. All the various ways of the people havebecome one way, and their words have become the same word. Then all the various thoughts emerged into one. Everyone’s rights were honored and everyone’s inheritance was given to him. He rewarded the good deeds of the good-doers. He honored those who had successfully passed their tests. He established the various ranks of the people in the government according to their religiousness. Then he treated with honor the one who had made progress due to his efforts. He raised his rank and rewarded him. The person we are talking about is just Thul-Riasatayn Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is a sincere aid who is steadfast in guarding Al-Ma’mun’s rights, and in expressing Al-Ma’mun’s reasons. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is a good teacher for the government officials and is a good leader for the troops. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is wise at war; is a good leader for the people; invites the people to Al-Ma’mun’s way and rewards those who honor Al-Ma’mun’s orders. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl avoids those who do not honor the orders of the Caliph, evade Al-Ma’mun’s orders or disobey him. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is the only one to assist Al-Ma’mun. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is the healer of those who are ill in their hearts or minds. Not having enough money or not finding a friend to assist him in these affairs will not prevent him from doing so. He does not go astray from the right path due to greed. Fear will not lead him towards others. Rather, he becomes more determined, more steadfast, stronger and wiser when others make trouble and try to spread fear like lightning and thunder. He seriously defends Al-Ma’mun’s rights and invites the people towards him until Thul-Riasatayn defeats the perverse; dulls their swords; cuts off their nails; totally eradicates their majesty from the root; and presses the backs of the atheists to the ground - those who broke their covenants, did not adhere to their covenants with Al-Ma’mun, looked down upon his rights and who were secure from his warnings before. In addition to all of that, as you have been told and heard when recited on the pulpits, the results of the efforts of Thul-Riasatayn in the classes of the pagan nations have been impressive, and God increased the extent of the Muslim lands due to him. Also, what the people of the world have taken from you and delivered to others is clear.Then the gratitude of Thul-Riasatayn for the gallantry of Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun), and his rising to fulfill his rights, the sacrificesof himself and his brother Abi Muhammad ibn Sahl who was blessed, and Thul-Riasatayn’s praiseworthy politics reached a point which led him ahead of others and he became the most successful. Thus the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) rewarded him with much wealth, property and ornaments, although these could not even equal just one day of his efforts and did not suffice for even one position from the positions he held. However, he abandoned all this due to his abstinence; great determination; his efforts to increase the Muslim’s wealth; abstaining from worldly wealth and looking down on the world; preferring the Hereafter and his extended inclination to the Hereafter. He often asked the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) to accept his resignation and expressed his lack of interest in being the prime minister. This resignation raised his rank near Al-Ma’mun and us (i.e. Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)) as God the Honorable the Exalted had made us informed of his viewpoints on the glory of the Muslims and the ruler, and his increased effort to improve the Muslims’ affairs and fight the pagans; plus other things which God had manifested for us (i.e. Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)) such as: his sincere intentions; sincerity; wisdom; good management; strong will; high intellect; assisting the Right; guidance; freedom and piety.Then since the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) trusted him and we (i.e. Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)) trusted him considering his religiousness, and choosing that in which there lied his good, then we fulfilled his request according to his rank and wrote the book Al-Hiba wal-Shart (the manuscript of which is included later on in this book) for him. We took God and those present there - including members of our household; the army heads; the staff of the court; the judges; the jurists; the jurisprudents; the elite and the masses as witnesses thereto. And the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) deemed it proper to distribute this book (Al-Hiba wal-Shart) in all towns, so that it would be spread (all over) everywhere; all the people would get to know it; it would be read from the pulpits; and a copy of it would be in the possession of every governor and judge. He has asked me to write it, explain its meaning, and it has three chapters as follows:Chapter 1: It describes everything done by Thul-Riasatayn due to which the Most Exalted God has made it incumbent upon us and all the Muslims to honor his rights.Chapter 2: It describes the degree of his progress; the correctness of his deeds; and that no one is allowed to do whatever he wishes to make a stumbling-block for his efforts; and the reasons for that. This is because not anyone of the people who have pledged allegiance to the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) must pledge allegiance to him (Thul-Riasatayn) and his brother. They have the right to remove any obstacles that might get in their way or try to cause corruption against us, them or our friends. This is done so that no one even thinks about opposing them, disobeying them or think of tricks to separate us from each other.Chapter 3: It describes the donations of the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) to Thul-Riasatayn; what he demanded due to his abstinence from this world; his adherence to abstinence; lack of interest in wealth and position being a reason that he has constantly made efforts for the Hereafter and demands enough reward just enough to eliminate any doubts in him. We honored him and granted to him whatever was incumbent upon us to bestow upon him and his brother, and for his abstaining from what we abstained from ourselves. This chapter includes everything that one who is cautious needs to be cautious about.And this is the manuscript of the book:In the Name of God the Beneficent, the Merciful. This is the writing and the conditions of the Commander of the Faithful Abdullah Al-Ma’mun and his successor to the throne Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) for Thul-Riasatayn Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl on Monday of the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan in the year 201 A.H. (816 A.D.). This is the day on which God perfected the affairs of the government of the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun). He concluded the contract for the succession to the throne, had the people clothed in green attire, reached his goal of improving the affairs of the people and overcoming his enemies.On that day we invited you to that in which there lies some reward for you (Thul-Riasatayn) since you have set out to honor the rights of God the Blessed the Sublime; the right of His Prophet (S); the right of the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) and the successor to his throne; the rights of the Hashemites from which it is hoped that the religion will improve and the relations between the Muslims will improve so much that the resulting blessings encompass us and the general public. The other reason is your assistance to me - the Commander of the Faithful(i.e. Al-Ma’mun) - in establishing the rules of the religion and the traditions of the Master of the Messengers (i.e. the Prophet Muhammad (S)); and invitation to both; choosing what is best and destroying the pagans; breaking the idols; and eliminating the rebellions. Also there are other known things that you have done in the town like dismissing the overthrown Caliph; what you did to the one called Asfar with the nickname Abul Saraya; and what you did to the other one who is called Mehdi being related to Muhammad ibn Ja’far ibn Muhammad Talebi and the Khalaji Turks; and what you did to the governors of Tabarestan including Hormoz ibn Shervin; the governor of Daylam; King Mahvars in Kabul; its other king - King Isfahboz; and what you did to Ibn al-Baram; and what you did in Mount Bidar Bandeh, Qarshistan, al-Qoor and its counties; and what you did to the Khaqan in Khorasan, and Maloon Sahib in Mount Tab’bat; and what you did in Kayman and at-taqreqar; and what you did in Erminiyet, Hijaz; and what you did to Sahib As-Sarir and Sahib al-Khazar, and the other battles in al-Maqrib.The salary which we (i.e. Al-Ma’mun and Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)) have established for you is an assistance with which we invited you - being one hundred million Dirhams - plus ten million Dirhams income in jewelry and whatever the Caliph has already bestowed upon you. Of course, we know that the worth of one hundred million Dirhams in jewelry is much less than what you deserve. You abandoned this much property when Amin bestowed it upon you, and chose God and His Religion over it. You were grateful to the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) and the successor to his throne. You gave up much property that was your reward and salary, and turned them over to the Muslims so that their treasury would become wealthier. You preferred others over yourself.Now you have asked us for what you are naturally inclined to, and you deserve what is due to you fo your abstinence from this world and these people. This abstinence is so much that now it has left no room for doubt for anyone who doubted whether your efforts are for this world or the Hereafter. And everyone was assured that all your efforts are not for this world, but for the Hereafter. Therefore, we are never needless of people like you. The requests of people like you should never be rejected, even though your demands be such that many blessings are taken away from us. In fact, your requests bring forth a lot of blessings for us. They reduce a lot of our expenditures, and prove that you desire the Hereafter to those who think that you want this position due to your greed for this world, and not the Hereafter.Now I (Al-Ma’mun) will fulfill your request, and assure it to you - strengthened by a covenant with God in which there is no change. I entrust you with the affairs without any hesitation, and appoint you to the rank (of prime minister). Do as you please. There is no one empowered to prevent what you decide to do, or enforce what you disapprove of. We will fend off from you what we would fend off from ourselves. Even if you get tired and rest for a while, you are still honored since your body needs comfort and honoring, too.Then we (Al-Ma’mun and Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)) will grant to you during your period of resting what we had given you before, but you donated to others. We will also establish the same amount of salary for your brother Hassan ibn Sahl plus half of his previous salary. This is for your sake, since he made a really good effort in fighting with the rebellious ones, and conquered Iraq twice. He dispersed the Satanic groups and thus religion was strengthened, and consecutive wars ended. He saved us, all the heads of the army and the politicians on the right by using himself.And we (Al-Ma’mun and Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.)) call God, His angels, the best of the people and all of those who have pledged allegiance to us and promised to be loyal to us as witnesses to what is in this book today and for the future. We establish God as the guarantor. We consider it incumbent upon ourselves to be loyal to the conditions that we have set with no exceptions in public or private. Believers adhere to their covenants. A covenant is binding and we are responsible. The best of the people are those who honor their covenants even when in the position of power. God the Highest said, ‘Fulfill the Covenant of God when ye have entered into it, and break not your oaths after ye have confirmed them; indeed ye have made God your surety; for God knoweth all that ye do.’Al-Hassan ibn Sahl wrote the following down for Al-Ma’mun, “In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. The Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) has made all that is in this book incumbent upon himself and God the Highest is the witness thereto. He is the guarantor. The book is written in his own handwriting in the (Arabic) month of Safar of the year 202 A.H. (816 A.D.) to clearly state what he has granted and the conditions thereon.”And Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) wrote in it, “In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ binds all that which is written in this bookupon himself as stressed here on this day, tomorrow and for as long as he lives. I establish God the Highest as a witness thereto and a guarantor. It suffices for God to be a witness.” And Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) wrote in his own handwriting, “In this month and this year. (And praise be to God - the Lord of the Two Worlds. And blessings be upon Muhammad (a.s.) and his Household, and greetings be upon them. God suffices for us and He is the best Trustee).”",

    "englishText": "45-2 My father and Muhammad ibn Al-Hassan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Waleed - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar and Ahmad ibn Idris quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Imran al-Ash’ari, on the authority of Abul Khayr Salih ibn Abi Hammad Ar-Razi, on the authority of Ishaq ibn Hammad ibn Zayd, “Yahya ibn Aktham al-Qadhi brought us all into one room and told us, ‘Al-Ma’mun has ordered me to bring together a group of experts on traditions, and some of the rhetoricians and theoreticians. I have brought together forty men from these two classes. I took them with me and told them to wait at the door to inform Al-Ma’mun’s gate-keeper about their arrival. They stayed there until Al-Ma’mun was informed about their arrival. Al-Ma’mun granted them permission to come in and they went in and greeted him. Al-Ma’mun spent an hour talking with and welcoming them. Then he said, “I want to take you as witnesses for me in the presence of the Blessed the Sublime God. Whoever needs to go to the toilet should do so. Then take off your shoes and coats and sit down and relax.” They did as he ordered. Then he faced the people and said, “O people! I have called you in to serve as witnesses in the presence of the Sublime God. Fear God. Look at yourselves and your leaders. My position and majesty should not prevent you from accepting what is right no matter who says it, or rejecting what is wrong no matter who says it. Be afraid of the Fire for yourselves and seek nearness to the Sublime God by pleasing and obeying Him. Know that those who get close to creatures by disobeying the Creator will be subdued to those creatures by God. Therefore, use your full power of reasoning in arguing with me. I am a man who thinks that Ali (a.s.) is the best man after the Prophet of God (a.s.). Therefore acknowledge me, if you consider what I say to be right and if I am correct. And argue with me and reject my claim using reasoning if I am wrong. Either I will question you, or you will question me as you please.” Once Al-Ma’mun said this, the experts on traditions said, “Fine. We will ask you.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Ask, but appoint one of you tospeak. Once he speaks if others have something to add, they can do so. Or if he makes a mistake, others can correct him.” Then one of them said, “We believe that the best of the people after the Prophet of God (a.s.) was Abu Bakr. This is because there is a unanimously accepted tradition in which we read that God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abu Bakr and Umar.’ We know that he is the best of the people after the Prophet (S), since the Prophet of Mercy issued this decree and ordered that we follow them since we know that only the best of the people will be appointed as leader.”Then Al-Ma’mun said, “There are many traditions. Either they are all correct or all incorrect. Or some are correct and some are incorrect. If we say that they are all correct, then they are all incorrect since some of them violate others. If we say they are all wrong; then the religion is wrong and the holy jurisprudence will be invalidated. Then we must accept the third option: that is some of the traditions are correct and some are incorrect. Now it is so that we must have some reason for their being correct to believe them and reject what is opposite to them. If the reason behind the tradition is right, we must believe it, accept it and put it into action. However, the tradition which you cited includes the proof which invalidates it within itself, since the Prophet of God (a.s.) is the most knowledgeable and wise. He is the most honest of the people. He is the person most improbable to misguide the people towards the impossible or towards believing what is wrong. Therefore, he should not have issued a decree to have these two people become his successors and Divine Leaders. This is because either both of them follow the same manners or followed opposite manners. If they were the same in all aspects, then they must be one in number, form and body. It has not been so and will never be so that two people be one and the same. But if they were different from each other, how is it permissible to follow both of them? This is impossible to do, since as you know obeying one would imply disobeying the other one, and vice versa. The reasons supporting that they were different in manners is that Aba Bakr used to capture the Ahl ar-Riddeh and Umar set them free. Umar asked Abu Bakr to put Khalid (ibn Valid) out of office and execute him for killing Malik ibn Nowayrah. Abu Bakr did not accept this and did not execute him. Umar forbade two Mutt’as ( that of women and Hajj), but Abu Bakr did not. Umar set up the payroll for the armed forces, while Abu Bakr did not doso. Abu Bakr appointed a successor for himself but Umar did not do so. There are many other examples.”The author of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “There exists another point here which Al-Ma’mun did not mention to the enemy. That is the tradition which has not been narrated as the Prophet (S) said, ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abi Bakr and Umar.’ It has been narrated it as ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abu Bakr and Umar.’ Also some have narrated it as ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abu Bakr and Umar.’ If so, it would have the following meaning considering what was said afterwards: ‘Follow those who will be after me - O people, and Abu Bakr and Umar - follow what (exists) after me - God’s Book and my Household.” Now let us return to the rest of what Al-Ma’mun said.Another one of the experts on traditions said, “God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘If I were to choose a friend, I would choose Aba Bakr as my friend.” Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible, since according to your traditions the Prophet (S) established the bonds of brotherhood between his companions, but did not do so for Ali (a.s.). Ali (a.s.) asked the reason for that. The Prophet (S) told him, “I have kept you to be my own brother.” Whichever of these we accept, the other one is rejected.Someone else said, “Ali (a.s.) himself said the following on the pulpit, ‘The best of the people in this nation after the Prophet (S) are Abu Bakr and Umar.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible too. If the Prophet (S) knew that those two were the noblest of all, he (a.s.) would not have appointed Amr ibn al-Aas and Osama ibn Zayd to be their governors. Also Ali’s words after the demise of the Prophet (S) also reject this. Ali (a.s.) said, ‘I was closer to him to be his successor than I am to my own shirt. However, I feared that there may be discord (in the nation), and the new Muslim converts might return to their state of unbelief.” Ali (a.s.) also asked, “How could those two (Abu Bakr and Umar) be better than I am, while I worshipped God out of my own free will before they did, and will continue to worship Him after them?”Someone else said, “Abu Bakr closed the door of his house and asked, ‘Is there anyone to cancel his pledge of allegiance to me?’ Ali (a.s.) said, ‘God’s Prophet (S) put you ahead. Who then can push you back?’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is not right, since Ali (a.s.) himself refused to pledge allegiance to Abi Bakr. You have narrated yourselves that Ali did not pledge allegiance for as long as (the Blessed Lady) Fatima (a.s.) was alive. Fatima (a.s.) willed that they bury her at night so that those two (Abu Bakr and Umar) could not be present at her funeral. And as another reason for the Prophet (S) not having established him (Abu Bakr) as his successor is that the Prophet (S) said, “Cancel the pledge of allegiance for me.” And also the Prophet (S) told the Helpers, “Vote for either Abu Obaydah or Umar.”Someone else said, “Amr ibn al-Aas said, ‘O Prophet of God! Which of your wives do you love the most?’ The Prophet (S) said, ‘Aa’isha.’ He asked, ‘Which of the men do you like the most?’ The Prophet (S) said, ‘Her father (Abu Bakr).’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is not right either. You yourselves have narrated that when they brought some fried chicken for the Prophet (S), he (a.s.) said, ‘O my God! Please make the most beloved of your creatures be present here.’ And that was Ali (a.s.). Then which of the two of your traditions can we believe?’” Someone else said, “In fact, Ali himself said, ‘I will carry out the punishment for accusation upon whoever considers me to be nobler than Abi Bakr and Umar.’” Al-Ma’mun asked, “How could Ali have said that he will punish one for whom punishment is ِnot decreed? If so, he would have transgressed the limits of the Honorable the Exalted God, and have acted against His orders. Considering him (Ali (a.s.)) to be nobler than those two is not an accusation, either. You yourselves have narrated that your leader (Abu Bakr) said, ‘I have become your master, but I am not any better than you are.’ Then tell me which of these two men do you consider to be more honest? Which one do you consider to be correct: what Abu Bakr said about himself or what Ali said about Abi Bakr? And yet there is a contradiction in this tradition. We have to say that either Abi Bakr is honest in what he says, or he is not. If he is honest, we must ask from where he got to know that. Was it through revelation or did he just think it up himself? If you say that it was due to revelation, we know that the revelations stopped (after the Prophet (S)). And if you say that it was what he himself thought, it cannot be so since we know that there is no way one could think of such things. If you say that he was dishonest, then it is impossible for such a dishonest person to be in charge of the affairs of the Muslims, to uphold the decrees and exercise Divinely-Ordained Punishments.”Someone else said, “It has been narrated that the Prophet (S) said, ‘Abu Bakr and Umar are the Masters of the Elders in Paradise.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible, since once an old lady called Ashja’iyya was with the Prophet (S) and the Prophet (S) said, ‘An old lady does not enter Paradise.’ She cried. Then the Prophet (S) said, ‘In fact, the Sublime God says, ‘We have created (their Companions) of special Creation. And made them virgin - pure (and undefiled), beloved (by nature), equal in age.’’ Thus you think that Abu Bakr is the only one who will become young when he enters Paradise, while you yourselves have narrated that God’s Prophet (S) told Al-Hassan (a.s.) and Al-Husayn (a.s.) that amongst all the people they are the Masters of Youth in Paradise; and that their father is even better than they are.’”Someone else said, “It has been narrated that the Prophet (S) said, ‘If I were not appointed from amongst you, then Umar would have been appointed.’” Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible since the Sublime God says, ‘We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him…’ Moreover, the Sublime God says, ‘And remember We took from the Prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant.’ How could it then be possible for someone for whom there has been (taken) a covenant (from) not to become a Prophet, and someone else without a covenant become a Prophet?’”Someone else said, “The Prophet (S) looked at Umar on the Day of Arafat, smiled and said, ‘The Blessed the Sublime God is proud of His servants in general, and is especially proud of Umar.’ Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible since the Blessed the Sublime God would not be especially proud of Umar and leave out His Prophet (S) as if Umar is someone especial, and the Prophet is like the rest of the people. This is not stranger than another one of your traditions in which you claim that God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘I entered Paradise and heard the sound of some sandals. When I looked around, I saw Bilal - the servant of Abi Bakr who had come to Paradise before me.’ Yes, the Shiites say that Ali is betterthan Abi Bakr, but you claim that the servant of Abi Bakr is nobler than the Prophet (S) since whoever comes first is better. You have also narrated that Satan runs away even from the shadow of Umar and also claim that Satan induced the Prophet (S) to say, ‘These idols are the Majestic Peacocks.’ You think that Satan fled even from Umar’s shadow, but induced expressions of atheism in the words of the Prophet (S).”Someone else said, “The Prophet (S) has said, ‘Should the penalty descend no one but Umar ibn al-Khattab will be saved.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is in complete contradiction with the text of the Book. In fact, the Sublime God told His Prophet (S), ‘But Allah was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongst them…’ You are setting up Umar to be like the Prophet (S).”Someone else said, “The Prophet (S) has testified that Umar is one of the ten companions who will be in Paradise.”Al-Ma’mun said, “Were it as you claim, Umar would have never asked Huthayfa, ‘I swear to you by God to tell me if I am one of the hypocrites?’ Had the Prophet (S) told him that he was going to Paradise, would he have denied what God’s Prophet (S) had said and ask that from Huthayfa? Then it could be seen that he acknowledged Huthayfa and not the Prophet (S) which is in opposition to being a Muslim. And if he had acknowledged the Prophet (S), why then did he ask that from Huthayfa? Thus these two traditions contradict each other.”Someone else said, “In fact, the Prophet (S) said, ‘They weighed me against my nation, and I weighed more. Then they put Abu Bakr in my place and he weighed more than me. Then they put Umar in my place and he weighed more than Abu Bakr. Then they took away the scale.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is also impossible. Either they measured their weight or they measured their deeds. If they measured their weights, it is not acceptable that they weighed more than the whole nation. And if they weighed their deeds, the deeds of all the nation were available to weigh at that time. Still those Muslims were not created to have done any deeds. Tell me, how did they outweigh the nation?” Some said, “According to their good deeds.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me, would someone who had more noble deeds after the demise of the Prophet (S)attain the same position as those who lived at the time of the Prophet (S), but had done less noble deeds? If you answer in the affirmative, I know of some people today whose good deeds - participation in a holy war, visiting the Kaaba (i.e. House of God), fasting, praying and giving charity - are much more than those who lived at the time of the Prophet (S).” They said, “You are right. The noble ones of our times are as noble as the noble ones at the time of the Prophet (S).” Al-Ma’mun replied, “Then consider what your religious leaders from whom you have learned your religion - have told you about the nobilities of Ali (a.s.); and what they have said about the ten companions whom they have promised to be sure to go to Paradise and compare them. If you see that their deeds are slightly nobler, then what you say is right. However, if you see that what they have narrated about Ali’s nobilities is more, then accept what your religious leaders have said about Ali and do not deviate from that.”The narrator added, “All of them lowered their heads.” Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “Why have you become silent?” They said, “We are finished asking questions.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then let me ask. What was the most rewarding deed on the day in which God appointed His Prophet (S)?” They said, “Rushing ahead of others in accepting Islam since the Sublime God says, ‘And those Foremost (in Faith) will be Foremost (in the Hereafter). These will be those Nearest to Allah.’”Al-Ma’mun asked, “Do you know of anyone who accepted Islam before Ali did?”The man said, “That is right, but he was still too young to accept Islam. Abu Bakr was older and the decree was designated for him (to be the Caliph). There is some difference between these two conditions.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me whether Ali’s acceptance of Islam was due to Divine Inspirations from the Sublime God, or was it just due to the invitation of the Prophet (S)? If you say that it was due to receiving inspirations, you have placed him above the Prophet (S) since the Prophet (S) did not receive any inspirations. It was Gabriel who descended (from Heaven) and delivered the messages of the Sublime God to him (a.s.). However, if you say that it was due to the Prophet’s invitation, tell me whether the Prophet (S) invited Ali (a.s.) out of his own will or was his invitation according to God’s order. If you say that it was due to the invitation of the Prophet (S) himself, this would contradict how theSublime God describes His Prophet (S) when He says, ‘…nor am I a pretender’ or when He says, ‘Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire. It is no less than inspiration sent down to him.’ If you say that it was due to God’s order, then God has ordered him to choose Ali (a.s.) from amongst all the children of the people to invite (to Islam). Therefore, the Prophet (S) has invited Ali (a.s.) to Islam due to trusting him and his being approved of by the Sublime God.On the other hand, tell me whether the Wise God would oblige His creatures to do what would be beyond their own power to do? If you answer in the affirmative, then you are an atheist. If, however, you answer in the negative, how would God order His Prophet (S) to invite someone (to Islam) who cannot accept the decree due to his being too young and not able to accept )the invitation)? Moreover, have you ever seen the Prophet (S) invite (to Islam) any other children from his family or outside his family to be designated as a model for Ali (a.s.)? If you think that the Prophet (S) has not invited any other child but Ali (a.s.) to Islam, then this itself would designate that Ali (a.s.) is nobler than all other children.” Al-Ma’mun then added, “Tell me, what would be the noblest deed after having faith.” They said, “Fighting in the way of God.” He said, “Do you know of a record of fighting in the way of God for any of those ten (companions) similar to that of Ali’s record in fighting with atheists and enemies in all the battles which the Prophet (S) conducted in history? Consider the Battle of Badr in which a total of a few more than sixty people were killed. Ali (a.s.) killed more than twenty of them himself, while all the other people killed nearly forty of them.” One of those present in the meeting said, “Abu Bakr was in his own tent along with the Prophet (S) and was directing the battle.” Al-Ma’mun said, “What a strange thing you are saying! Did Abu Bakr plan the battles by himself and without the Prophet (S), or did he participate in the planning along with the Prophet (S), or was it the case that the Prophet (S) needed Abu Bakr’s opinion and leadership? Which of the three cases do you prefer to choose?” The man said, “I take refuge in God from thinking that he participated along with the Prophet (S) in planning the battles, or that he himself decided what to do without the Prophet (S), or that the Prophet (S) needed his opinion.” Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “Then what is the nobility of sitting in a tent and watching the fighters? If the nobility of Abu Bakr was due to his abandoning holy war and not going to thebattlefield, then we must say that all of those who disobey (God) and do not go to the battlefield are nobler than those who fight. The Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath God promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward.’”Ishaq ibn Hammad ibn Zayd said, “Al-Ma’mun then told me to recite the Qur’anic Chapter Insan. I recited it, ‘Has there not been over Man a long period of Time, when he was nothing…’ until I reached the following verse, ‘And they feed, for the love of Allah, the indigent, the orphan, and the captive.’ And I continued reciting the Chapter up to (a.s.aying), “Verily this is a Reward for you, and your Endeavor is accepted and recognized.” Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “About whom were these verses recited?” I said, “About Ali.” He asked, “Do you know of any traditions in which it is narrated that while Ali (a.s.) fed the poor and assisted the orphans and the captives, he said, ‘We feed you for the sake of Allah alone: no reward do we desire from you, nor thanks’ as it appears in the Qur’an?” I said, “No.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then the Honorable the Exalted God was aware of what went on within Ali’s (a.s.) heart and expressed it in His Book to make it known to His creatures.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Do you understand what the Sublime God describes when He describes Paradise in this verse saying, ‘Crystal-clear, made of silver: they will determine the measure thereof (according to their wishes).’” I said, “No.” He said, “This is another nobility. How could there be any crystal-clear silver?” Ishaq said, “I do not know.” Al-Ma’mun replied, “He wants us to imagine silver so clear that one can see its inside from the outside. O Ishaq! This is similar to what the Prophet of God (a.s.) said, ‘O slower! Be more patient with these crystal-clear ones’ referring to ladies due to their being so delicate. It is also similar to what the Prophet of God (a.s.) said, ‘I rode Abu Talha’s horse and found it like a sea’ implying that it galloped very fast just as the sea waves do. And as the Sublime God says, ‘…death will come to him from every quarter, yet will he not die: and in front of him will be a chastisement unrelenting’ even though he will die even if death comes to him from just one side.”Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “O Ishaq! Are you not one of those who testify that those ten (companions) are in Paradise?” I said, “yes.” He said, “If you saw that someone did not know whether this tradition was correct or not, would you consider him to be an atheist?” I said, “No.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “What if he asks whether this Chapter is from the Qur’an or not, will you then consider him to be an atheist?” I said, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then I consider the nobility of this man (Ali (a.s.)) to be more. O Ishaq! Tell me if you consider the tradition about the fried chicken (which was brought for the Prophet (S)) to be correct or not?” I said, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “By God, your animosity can be seen from this. There are only three possibilities. It is either that he was accepted due to the supplications of the Prophet (S), or he was rejected, or that God could not recognize between the noble one and the others. Tell me, which one do you like the most?” Ishaq said, “I kept my head down for some time and then I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! The Sublime God said the following regarding Abi Bakr: He had no more than one companion; the two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, ‘Have no fear, for Allah is with us’: then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in Might, Wise.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “Glory be to God! How little is your knowledge of the Book? Can an atheist be a companion of a believer? What kind of nobility is this? Didn’t you hear the Words of the Sublime God, ‘His companion said to him, in the course of the argument with him: Dost thou deny Him Who created thee out of dust, then out of a sperm-drop, then fashioned thee into a man?’ Thus you see that God made an atheist a believer’s companion. Or according to the following poems from al-Hothali:The morning came and the horse which I rode was wildIt saw the East from beneath its cover.Or as Al-Azdi said,I was frightened about being alone there with my only companion,being a gentle, tall, four-legged animal with thin forelegs.Here the poet has likened his horse to his companion. And when the Sublime God says, ‘…for God is with us…’ means that the Blessed the Sublime God is with every good-doer and every evil-doer. Have you not heard the Words of the Sublime God, ‘Seest thou not that Allah doth know (all) that is in the heavens and on earth? There is not a secret consultation between three, but He makes the fourth among them, nor between five but He makes the sixth, nor between fewer nor more, but He is in their midst, wheresoever they be: In the end will He tell them the truth of their conduct, on the Day of Judgment. For Allah has full knowledge of all things.’ And regarding His words, ‘Have no fear…’ Tell me about the fears of Abi Bakr. Were they said in obedience, or disobedience? If you consider them to be said in obedience, you have said that the Prophet (S) admonished him against obedience. However, this contradicts what a wise person would do. And if you think that he has disobeyed, then what is the nobility of one who is disobedient? Tell me, upon whom did God send down peace in the following Words of the Sublime God, ‘…then Allah sent down His peace upon him…’”Ishaq replied, “To Abi Bakr since the Prophet (S) did not need any peace. The Prophet (S) was not afraid.”He said, “Let me know about the Words of the Honorable the Exalted, ‘Assuredly Allah did help you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain: Behold! your great numbers elated you, but they availed you naught: the land, for all that it is wide, did constrain you, and ye turned back in retreat. But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers…’”Al-Ma’mun asked, “Do you know who is meant by the believers to whom the Sublime God refers in this verse?” I said, “I do not know.” Al-Ma’mun said, “On the day of the Battle of Hunain the people fled from the battlefield. Only seven people from the Hashemites stayed with the Prophet of God (a.s.). They consisted of Ali (a.s.) who fought with his sword, Abbas who held the horse-strap for the Prophet of God (a.s.), and five others who surrounded the Prophet (S) fearing that the pagans might strike him (a.s.) with their weapons, until the Blessed the Sublime God granted victory to His Messenger (a.s.). Therefore, the reference to the believers in this verse is to Ali (a.s.) and those of the Hashemites who stayed there. Then who is nobler? The one (Ali (a.s.)) who was with theProphet (S) and peace descended upon him and the Prophet (S), or the one (Abu Bakr) who was with the Prophet (S) in the cave, but was not deserving enough for peace to be descended upon? O Ishaq! Which one is nobler? The one (Abu Bakr) who was in the cave with the Prophet (S) or the one (Ali (a.s.)) who slept in the Prophet’s (a.s.) bed sacrificing himself to allow the Prophet (S) to complete his Emigration. In fact, the Blessed the Sublime God ordered His Prophet (S) to order Ali (a.s.) to sleep in the Prophet’s (a.s.) bed, so that the Prophet’s (a.s.) life would be saved. Ali (a.s.) asked, “O the Prophet of GOD! Will you be saved this way?” The Prophet (S) said, “Yes.” Then Ali (a.s.) said, “I hear and obey.” Then he slept in the Prophet’s (a.s.) bed and wrapped a sheet around himself. The pagans surrounded the house and went in. They had no doubt that the Prophet (S) was there. One man from each tribe had come there to each deliver a blow to the Prophet (S), so that the Hashemites could not demand retribution. Ali (a.s.) heard their plans and knew that his life was in danger. However, nothing could scare him as Abu Bakr was scared in the cave. Yet, Abu Bakr was with the Prophet (S) while Ali was there alone. Ali (a.s.) was patient and steadfast. The Sublime God sent down angels to guard him from the evils of the Quraysh (tribe) enemies. When dawn came, they saw him, looked at him and asked, “Where is Muhammad?” Ali (a.s.) replied, “I do not know.” They said, “You have tricked us.” Ali (a.s.) joined the Prophet (S) later. Thus it was Ali (a.s.) who was nobler and good deeds were done by him day after day, until the Sublime God took his life and he was well forgiven by Him.”Al-Ma’mun asked, “O Ishaq! Have you not been the one who narrated the tradition on Mastery?” Ishaq said, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Please narrate it for me.” Ishaq narrated it for him. Al-Ma’mun said, “Don’t you see that this tradition established a right for Ali (a.s.) incumbent upon Abi Bakr and Umar, but has not established any rights for those two incumbent upon Ali (a.s.)?” Ishaq said, “The people say that God’s Prophet (S) has said this the following regarding Zayd ibn Haritha.” He asked, “Where and when did the Prophet (S) say this?” I said, “In the Ghadir Khom fter returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage of the Kaaba.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Where was Zayd ibn Haritha killed?” I said, “In Mo’ta.” He said, “Was Zayd ibn Haritha not killed before the Qadir Khom instance?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Tell me, what if your fifteen year old son says, ‘O people! Accept that my servant belongs to my cousin.’ Willyou be hurt from this?” I said, “Yes. I will not like that and tell him.” He said, “You tell your son not to say what you believe that the Prophet of God did. Woe be to you who have taken your jurisprudents as your Masters! In fact, the Sublime God says, ‘They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of Allah…’ Yet I swear by God that they neither fasted for them nor did they pray to them. They only obeyed whatever they said. Then Al-Ma’mun added, “Have you narrated the tradition in which God’s Prophet (S) told Ali (a.s.), “Your position relative to me is as same as Aaron’s position relative to Moses.” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Don’t you know that Aaron was Moses’ brother from the side of both his father and mother?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Was Ali the same?” I said, “No.” He said, “Aaron was a Prophet but Ali (a.s.) was not. Then what was the third rank which he (a.s.) had other than that of being the successor? This was said because the hypocrites said, ‘It was hard for the Prophet (S) to take Ali with him and left him (a.s.) behind while the Prophet (S) wanted him to remain there with peace of mind and that is why he (a.s.) said that. This is similar to what Moses (a.s.) told Aaron as said by the Sublime God, ‘Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief.’ I told him, “But Moses (a.s.) left Aaron to be his successor for all his people while Moses (a.s.) was alive and just went to meet his Lord - the Sublime. But the Prophet (S) left Ali (a.s.) as his successor only when he (a.s.) went to the battles.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me. Were there some of his companions along with him when Moses (a.s.) left Aaron as his successor to go to meet his Lord - the Honorable the Exalted?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Did he not establish him as his successor for all of them?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “The Prophet (S) also established Ali (a.s.) as his successor for the weak ones, the women and the children when he (a.s.) went to the battlefield while most of his people were along with him. However, the Prophet (S) appointed Ali (a.s.) to be the successor over all of them. Moreover, the proof that he (a.s.) appointed Ali (a.s.) to be his (a.s.) successor over them during his lifetime when he was not there, and after his demise is that the Prophet (S) said, ‘The position of Ali relative to me is like that of Aaron’s position relative to Moses with the only difference that there will be no more Prophets after me.’ Therefore, according to this expression, Ali (a.s.) is like the prime minister for the Prophet (S), since Moses (a.s.) prayed to the Sublime God and in his prayers and said, ‘And give me a Minister from my family - Aaron, my brother, add to mystrength through him.’ So Ali (a.s.) was to the Prophet (S) like Aaron was to Moses (a.s.). Aaron was the Moses’ Minister, and Ali (a.s.) was the Successor of the Prophet (S) as Aaron was the Successor of Moses (a.s.).” Then Al-Ma’mun looked at the theoreticians and the rhetoricians and asked, “Should I ask you questions or will you ask me?” They said, “We will ask.” He said, “Go ahead and ask.” One of them asked, “Is it not that the Divine Leadership of Ali (a.s.) as expressed by the Prophet of God (a.s.) similar to his expression of the other obligatory deeds such as ‘There are four units for the noon prayer’ or ‘The alms tax for two hundred Dirhams is five Dirhams’ or ‘Go on the pilgrimage to Mecca?’” Al-Ma’mun said, “Yes.” He asked, “Why then are there no differences of opinion about the obligatory deeds, but there are differences concerning the Successorship of Ali?” Al-Ma’mun said, “That is because the obligatory deeds are not such that the people would all compete with each other over them, but there is competition over becoming the successor.”Another one asked, “Why do you deny that the Prophet (S) ordered that the people be allowed to choose someone from amongst themselves to be his successor due to the compassion and kindness which the Prophet (S) had for his nation, and did not appoint a Successor for himself whom the people would disobey as a result of which punishment would descend upon them?” Al-Ma’mun said, “The reason I deny this is because the Sublime God is kinder to His creatures than the Prophet (S). God appointed a Prophet (S) for the people, but did not let them choose him themselves - even though He knew that there were some people among them who would disobey him and there were others who would obey him. This did not prevent the Sublime God from sending the Prophet (S). Another reason is that there would be two possibilities if God had let the people themselves choose a man (to be their Prophet). Either God orders all of them to choose someone or God orders only some of them to choose someone (to be the Prophet). If God orders all of them to choose someone, then no one could be considered to have free will and be free to choose (a.s.ince they are all ordered to vote for someone else). And if God has ordered only some of them to choose someone to be their Prophet, then the ones who are ordered to choose the Prophet must have some significant traits. If you say that they are the jurisprudents, then the significant signs of jurisprudents should be clarified.” Another one said, “It has been narrated that the Prophet (S) said, ‘In the presence of theSublime God, whatever the Muslims consider to be good is good. In the presence of the Sublime God, whatever the Muslims consider to be evil is evil.’” Al-Ma’mun said, “Here we must see whether the Prophet (S) meant all the believers or only some of them. If we say that the Prophet (S) meant all the believers, then this is an impossible thing. And if we think that the Prophet (S) meant only some of them, then as we know each group says something is good. This is like the traditions which the Shiites have narrated about Ali (a.s.), and the non-Shiites have narrated about the others. Then how could that Divine Leadership which is in your mind be proven?”Another one asked, “Is it then permissible to think that the companions of Muhammad (a.s.) made mistakes?” Al-Ma’mun said, “How could we think that they all made a mistake and they were all at a loss, while as you think they considered Divine Leadership neither to be necessary nor a tradition. You think that Divine Leadership is not a necessity in the opinion of the Sublime God, and it is not one of the traditions of His Prophet (S). Then how could what is neither obligatory nor a tradition be a mistake?”Another one said, “Present your reasons if you claim that Ali (a.s.) and no one else deserves the position of Divine Leadership.” Al-Ma’mun said, “I do not claim this, but I confess to it. There are no reasons for what one confesses to. The claimant is him who thinks that he is in charge of all appointments and dismissals, and that he is in charge of everyone. As for reasons, they may be either cited by those of his (Ali’s) peers like Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman and their followers who are all his (Ali’s) enemies, or others whose reasoning has no effect and does not exist at all. Then how could any reasons be presented in such a case?”Another one asked, “What was incumbent upon Ali (a.s.) to do after the demise of the Prophet of God (a.s.)?” Al-Ma’mun said, “That which he (a.s.) did.” The man asked, “Was it not incumbent upon him to declare to the people that he (Ali) is the Divine Leader?” Al-Ma’mun said, “In fact, Divine Leadership is neither in his (Ali’s) hands, nor is it in the hands of the people so that they may choose him or prefer him over others. Rather, it is in the hands of the Sublime God as God told Abraham (a.s.), ‘…I will make thee an Imam to the Nations…’ and as the Sublime God told David (a.s.), ‘O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent onearth…’ And in the case of Adam the Honorable, the Exalted God told His angels, ‘…I will create a vicegerent on earth…’ Therefore, a Divine Leader is appointed by the Sublime God and because of His choice. A Divine Leader is perfect in Creation, from a good family, pure in nature, and innocent throughout life. If it was in one’s own hands, then anyone who was like this was a Divine Leader or deserved to be one; and once he acted against these characteristics he would be dismissed from the position of Divine Leadership automatically. In that case, the appointment and dismissal of the Divine Leader was subject to one’s deeds.”Another one asked, “Then why did you consider Divine Leadership to be a must for Ali (a.s.) after the demise of the Prophet (S)?” Al-Ma’mun said, “Since Ali (a.s.) came into existence with faith from the time of his birth, just like the Prophet (S) had faith from his childhood. Also Ali (a.s.) was free from the deviations of his people (of Quraysh) who had no real reasons for their idol-worshipping, just as the Prophet (S) was free from deviations and idol-worshipping. Idol-worshipping is, in fact, a form of oppression. Any oppressor cannot be a Divine Leader. One who worships idols could not become a leader by the acceptance of all the Muslims. In fact, whoever worships idols has adopted the enemy of God as a god. His decrees would be the decrees of a pagan by the unanimous consensus of all of the nation who bear witness to his atheism, unless they again bear witness that he is no longer an atheist. Whoever once professes to be an atheist should never become a ruler since in that case there would be no differences between one who has professed atheism and a ruler.”Another one asked, “Why did Ali (a.s.) not fight with Abu Bakr and Umar as he (a.s.) did with Mo’awiya?” Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible to ask. They should ask about positive actions, not negative ones. That is they would ask for the reasons if Ali (a.s.) had risen to fight them. They cannot ask the reasons for his not rising. We must see whether the issue of the Mastery of Ali (a.s.) was decreed by God, or by others. If it is the case that it was decreed by the Sublime God, then any doubt in His Plan constitutes atheism as the Sublime God said, ‘But no, by the Lord, they can have no (real) Faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against Thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction.’ Therefore, one’s deeds are due to one’s origin. If the appointment of Ali (a.s.) wasdecreed by the Sublime God, then Ali’s deeds come from Him and the people must be content with (the appointment) and submit to Ali’s orders. Even the Messenger of God (a.s.) quit fighting on the day of Al-Hodaybiyeh, when the pagans prevented him from performing the ‘Umra (recommendable pilgrimage) ceremonies to the House (of God). And once the Prophet (S) brought together his troops, he fought with them as the Sublime God says, ‘…So overlook (any human faults) with gracious forgiveness.’ Then the Honorable the Exalted said, ‘…then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)…’”Another one asked, “If it is the case as you think that the appointment of Ali (a.s.) to the Divine Leadership was decreed by God and it is obligatory to obey him, why is it then not permissible for the Prophets to abandon the (God’s) invitation and the call, but it was permissible for Ali (a.s.) to abandon what he was ordered to do in calling the people to obey him?” Al-Ma’mun said, “We do not claim that Ali (a.s.) had the mission to invite the people as the Messengers (a.s.) did. We consider him to be a sign or link between the Sublime God and His creatures. Whoever obeys Ali (a.s.) is obedient to God, and whoever opposes Ali (a.s.) is disobeying God. Ali (a.s.) would have strived to call the people to obey him if he had found any helpers. Ali is not to blame for not having found any helpers. Those who did not help him are to be blamed, since they were supposed to obey him anyways. However, he was not ordered to fight without having any helpers. He is like the House of God towards which the people go to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. If they do so they have performed what is incumbent upon them to do. If, however, they do not go, it is they who are to blame, not the House of God.”Another one asked, “If it has been made incumbent upon the people that they must have a Divine Leader whom they must obey, why should it be Ali (a.s.) and no one else?” Al-Ma’mun replied, “That is because the Sublime God would not make some vague thing incumbent upon the people, since that is impossible to do. Thus His Messenger (a.s.) must introduce Ali (a.s.) and this obligation to the people, so that there are no more excuses left for the people in the presence of the Honorable the Exalted God. Don’t you see that if the Sublime God had made it incumbent upon the people to fast for one month, but had not specified which month to fast in and had not given any signs to identify it; and ifthe people were left free to use their own intellect to recognize the month in which the Sublime God wanted them to fast, then the people no longer needed any Prophets or Divine Leaders to inform them about what the Prophet said.”Another one asked, “How can you prove that Ali (a.s.) was mature when the Prophet (S) invited him (to accept Islam)? The people think that when he was invited (to accept Islam) he was a child and ordering him to do so was not permitted. The people think that Ali (a.s.) had not reached the age of maturity for men at that time.”Al-Ma’mun replied, “At that time, Ali (a.s.) was either mature enough that God sent His Prophet (S) to him and invited him (to accept Islam) in which case it would be permitted to order him to abide by Divine decrees and perform the obligatory deeds, or Ali (a.s.) was not mature enough for God to sent His Prophet (S) to him - which is not possible for the Prophet (S) to do as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘And if the apostle were to invent any sayings in Our name, We should certainly seize him by his right hand and We should certainly then cut off the artery of his heart.’ Given this, would the Prophet (S) oblige God’s servants (people) to perform what the Blessed the Sublime God has not granted them the power to carry out? This is an impossibility which cannot be. No wise person would order to do so, neither would the Prophet (S). God is so Sublime that He would not order to do what is impossible to do. His Messenger’s (a.s.) rank is also much higher than to order to do what is impossible to do according to the Wisdom of the Wise One (God).”At this point all the people became quiet. Then Al-Ma’mun said, “You asked me questions and argued with me. Can I ask you some questions now?” They replied, “Yes.”Al-Ma’mun said, “Is it not unanimously accepted by the nation that the Prophet (S) said, ‘Whoever purposefully ascribes lies to me has prepared his seating place in the Fire (in the Hereafter)’?” They replied, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Have they not also narrated on the authority of the Prophet (S) that he (a.s.) said, ‘Whoever disobeys God - be it a minor sin or a major sin - and sets that to be his way and insists on it would reside in Fire (in the Hereafter)’?” They replied, “Yes.”Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me if it is permissible to consider someone that the people have chosen as their leader to be called the successor of God’sProphet (S) or not. Is it permissible to consider him to be appointed by the Honorable the Exalted God even though the Prophet (S) has not established him to be his successor? If you say ‘yes it is permitted’ you are undoubtedly deceitful. If you say ‘no’ then it is a necessary conclusion that Abu Bakr be not considered to be the successor to God’s Prophet (S) nor was he appointed to the position of Caliphate by the Honorable the Exalted God. Thus you have ascribed lies to God’s Prophet (S) and are possibly of those that the Prophet (S) said would enter the Fire. Then tell me which of the following that you say is true: ‘The Prophet passed away without establishing a successor for himself’, or that you call Abu Bakr ‘O successor of God’s Prophet (S)!’ If you claim that both of these statements are true, such a claim is not possible to make since these are contradictory statements both of which cannot be true at the same time. And if you consider one to be true, then you have disproved the other one. Therefore, fear God and consider your own conditions. Do not imitate others. Avoid what is doubtful. I swear by God that the Sublime God would not accept any opinions expressed by His servants, unless they are the result of contemplation and the intellect approves of its being right. Having opposing ideas (about something) is being doubtful. It is not considered to be certitude. Having continual doubt is denying the Sublime God, and would result in dwelling in the Fire.”Al-Ma’mun added, “Tell me if it is permissible for a slave which one buys to become his master, and the buyer becomes a slave.” They said, “No.” He added, “How is it then possible for someone around whom you have gathered, supported him and put him in charge of the Caliphate be your master while you are the ones who have granted him the mastery over you? Will it not be the case that you are his masters? You have made someone to be the Caliph and have then said that he is the successor to the Prophet of God (a.s.). Moreover, once you get discontented with him you would kill him, as you did with Uthman ibn Affan.”Someone said, “That is because the Imam is an agent for the Muslims as long as they are pleased with him. They can dismiss him whenever they are displeased with him.”Al-Ma’mun asked, “To whom do the Muslims, the servants (people) and the towns belong?” They replied, “To the Sublime God.” Al-Ma’munsaid, “Then God is more deserving to appoint an agent over His servants (people) and towns than anyone else, since one of the unanimously accepted principles among the nation is that whoever causes any harm to someone else’s property is held responsible for that, and no one is allowed to usurp the rights over anyone else’s property and he will be sinful and held responsible if he does so.”Then Al-Ma’mun added, “Tell me if the Prophet (S) left anyone as his successor when he died.” They answered, “No, he did not appoint any successor.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Was not doing so guidance or deviation?” They said, “It was guidance.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then it is incumbent upon the people to follow guidance, and not become deviated.” They said, “They did so.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Why then did they appoint a successor after the Prophet (S), even though the Prophet (S) had not done so? Abandoning his way is in itself a form of deviation. It is impossible for what is against guidance to be guidance. If not appointing a successor is considered to be a form of guidance, then why did Abu Bakr appoint a successor for himself when the Prophet (S) had not done so? Umar also referred this issue to the council among the Muslims which was against what his friend (Abu Bakr) had done. You think that the Prophet (S) did not appoint a successor for himself, but Abu Bakr appointed a successor for himself, and Umar did not abandon appointing a successor as the Prophet (S) had done. And as you think Umar did not appoint himself a successor as Abu Bakr had done and used a third approach. Tell me, which of these do you consider to be correct. If you consider what the Prophet (S) did to be correct, then you have considered Abu Bakr to have done wrong. The same holds true for the other options. Tell me, which of these ways is correct. Is what the Prophet (S) did in not appointing a successor correct, or is what the others did who somehow appointed a successor for themselves correct? Tell me, whether not appointing a successor by the Prophet (S) is guidance, and appointing a successor by the other ones is also guidance. Thus guidance is the opposite of guidance. Then what does deviation mean? Where is it? Tell me whether there have been any successors from amongst the Prophet’s (a.s.) companions who have been appointed as the successor with a unanimous consensus after the Prophet’s demise.” Al-Ma’mun added, “If you say no, then you have surely decided that all the people have gone the wrong way after the demise of God’s Prophet (S).And if you say yes, then you have refuted the opinion of the whole nation and what you say will void undeniable things. Tell me whether what the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Say: ‘To whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth?…’ is true or false?” They said, “It is true.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Is it not true that whatever is not with God belongs to God, since He is its creator and owner?” They replied, “Yes.” He said, “This disproves what you have made incumbent yourselves being to appoint a successor for God’s Prophet (S), so that the successor’s decrees are in effect regarding you and that you consider him to be a Caliph. You put him out of office whenever you get mad at him. You kill him if he refuses to give up his power. Woe be to you! Do not ascribe lies to God, since you will face its punishment when you stand in the presence of the Sublime God, and go to see God’s Prophet (S) having purposefully ascribed lies to him. The Prophet (S) has said, “Whoever purposefully ascribes lies to me will encounter his place prepared in the Fire.”Then Al-Ma’mun faced the prayer direction (the Qibla), raised his hands and said, “O God! I advised them and did not hesitate to tell them what I had to say. O God! I did not leave them in doubt. O God! In the interests of my religion I sought to get close to you by preferring Ali over others after your Prophet Muhammad (S), just as your Messenger had ordered us to do.” The narrator said, “Then we all dispersed and there was never again such a congregation for as long as Al-Ma’mun lived.”Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Imran al-Ash’ari said, “In another tradition we read that all the people became quiet. Then Al-Ma’mun asked, ‘Why have you become quiet?’ They said, ‘We do not know what to say.’ Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Therefore, this much debate suffices and you were convinced.’ Then he ordered that everyone be directed out. We were all directed out in a state of being confused and ashamed. Then Al-Ma’mun looked at Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl and said, ‘This is all that they had to say. No one should think that my majesty prevented them from rejecting what I said. God is the One who grants success.’”",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "45-2 My father and Muhammad ibn Al-Hassan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Waleed - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar and Ahmad ibn Idris quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Imran al-Ash’ari, on the authority of Abul Khayr Salih ibn Abi Hammad Ar-Razi, on the authority of Ishaq ibn Hammad ibn Zayd, ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "“Yahya ibn Aktham al-Qadhi brought us all into one room and told us, ‘Al-Ma’mun has ordered me to bring together a group of experts on traditions, and some of the rhetoricians and theoreticians. I have brought together forty men from these two classes. I took them with me and told them to wait at the door to inform Al-Ma’mun’s gate-keeper about their arrival. They stayed there until Al-Ma’mun was informed about their arrival. Al-Ma’mun granted them permission to come in and they went in and greeted him. Al-Ma’mun spent an hour talking with and welcoming them. Then he said, “I want to take you as witnesses for me in the presence of the Blessed the Sublime God. Whoever needs to go to the toilet should do so. Then take off your shoes and coats and sit down and relax.” They did as he ordered. Then he faced the people and said, “O people! I have called you in to serve as witnesses in the presence of the Sublime God. Fear God. Look at yourselves and your leaders. My position and majesty should not prevent you from accepting what is right no matter who says it, or rejecting what is wrong no matter who says it. Be afraid of the Fire for yourselves and seek nearness to the Sublime God by pleasing and obeying Him. Know that those who get close to creatures by disobeying the Creator will be subdued to those creatures by God. Therefore, use your full power of reasoning in arguing with me. I am a man who thinks that Ali (a.s.) is the best man after the Prophet of God (a.s.). Therefore acknowledge me, if you consider what I say to be right and if I am correct. And argue with me and reject my claim using reasoning if I am wrong. Either I will question you, or you will question me as you please.” Once Al-Ma’mun said this, the experts on traditions said, “Fine. We will ask you.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Ask, but appoint one of you tospeak. Once he speaks if others have something to add, they can do so. Or if he makes a mistake, others can correct him.” Then one of them said, “We believe that the best of the people after the Prophet of God (a.s.) was Abu Bakr. This is because there is a unanimously accepted tradition in which we read that God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abu Bakr and Umar.’ We know that he is the best of the people after the Prophet (S), since the Prophet of Mercy issued this decree and ordered that we follow them since we know that only the best of the people will be appointed as leader.”Then Al-Ma’mun said, “There are many traditions. Either they are all correct or all incorrect. Or some are correct and some are incorrect. If we say that they are all correct, then they are all incorrect since some of them violate others. If we say they are all wrong; then the religion is wrong and the holy jurisprudence will be invalidated. Then we must accept the third option: that is some of the traditions are correct and some are incorrect. Now it is so that we must have some reason for their being correct to believe them and reject what is opposite to them. If the reason behind the tradition is right, we must believe it, accept it and put it into action. However, the tradition which you cited includes the proof which invalidates it within itself, since the Prophet of God (a.s.) is the most knowledgeable and wise. He is the most honest of the people. He is the person most improbable to misguide the people towards the impossible or towards believing what is wrong. Therefore, he should not have issued a decree to have these two people become his successors and Divine Leaders. This is because either both of them follow the same manners or followed opposite manners. If they were the same in all aspects, then they must be one in number, form and body. It has not been so and will never be so that two people be one and the same. But if they were different from each other, how is it permissible to follow both of them? This is impossible to do, since as you know obeying one would imply disobeying the other one, and vice versa. The reasons supporting that they were different in manners is that Aba Bakr used to capture the Ahl ar-Riddeh and Umar set them free. Umar asked Abu Bakr to put Khalid (ibn Valid) out of office and execute him for killing Malik ibn Nowayrah. Abu Bakr did not accept this and did not execute him. Umar forbade two Mutt’as ( that of women and Hajj), but Abu Bakr did not. Umar set up the payroll for the armed forces, while Abu Bakr did not doso. Abu Bakr appointed a successor for himself but Umar did not do so. There are many other examples.”The author of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “There exists another point here which Al-Ma’mun did not mention to the enemy. That is the tradition which has not been narrated as the Prophet (S) said, ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abi Bakr and Umar.’ It has been narrated it as ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abu Bakr and Umar.’ Also some have narrated it as ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abu Bakr and Umar.’ If so, it would have the following meaning considering what was said afterwards: ‘Follow those who will be after me - O people, and Abu Bakr and Umar - follow what (exists) after me - God’s Book and my Household.” Now let us return to the rest of what Al-Ma’mun said.Another one of the experts on traditions said, “God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘If I were to choose a friend, I would choose Aba Bakr as my friend.” Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible, since according to your traditions the Prophet (S) established the bonds of brotherhood between his companions, but did not do so for Ali (a.s.). Ali (a.s.) asked the reason for that. The Prophet (S) told him, “I have kept you to be my own brother.” Whichever of these we accept, the other one is rejected.Someone else said, “Ali (a.s.) himself said the following on the pulpit, ‘The best of the people in this nation after the Prophet (S) are Abu Bakr and Umar.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible too. If the Prophet (S) knew that those two were the noblest of all, he (a.s.) would not have appointed Amr ibn al-Aas and Osama ibn Zayd to be their governors. Also Ali’s words after the demise of the Prophet (S) also reject this. Ali (a.s.) said, ‘I was closer to him to be his successor than I am to my own shirt. However, I feared that there may be discord (in the nation), and the new Muslim converts might return to their state of unbelief.” Ali (a.s.) also asked, “How could those two (Abu Bakr and Umar) be better than I am, while I worshipped God out of my own free will before they did, and will continue to worship Him after them?”Someone else said, “Abu Bakr closed the door of his house and asked, ‘Is there anyone to cancel his pledge of allegiance to me?’ Ali (a.s.) said, ‘God’s Prophet (S) put you ahead. Who then can push you back?’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is not right, since Ali (a.s.) himself refused to pledge allegiance to Abi Bakr. You have narrated yourselves that Ali did not pledge allegiance for as long as (the Blessed Lady) Fatima (a.s.) was alive. Fatima (a.s.) willed that they bury her at night so that those two (Abu Bakr and Umar) could not be present at her funeral. And as another reason for the Prophet (S) not having established him (Abu Bakr) as his successor is that the Prophet (S) said, “Cancel the pledge of allegiance for me.” And also the Prophet (S) told the Helpers, “Vote for either Abu Obaydah or Umar.”Someone else said, “Amr ibn al-Aas said, ‘O Prophet of God! Which of your wives do you love the most?’ The Prophet (S) said, ‘Aa’isha.’ He asked, ‘Which of the men do you like the most?’ The Prophet (S) said, ‘Her father (Abu Bakr).’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is not right either. You yourselves have narrated that when they brought some fried chicken for the Prophet (S), he (a.s.) said, ‘O my God! Please make the most beloved of your creatures be present here.’ And that was Ali (a.s.). Then which of the two of your traditions can we believe?’” Someone else said, “In fact, Ali himself said, ‘I will carry out the punishment for accusation upon whoever considers me to be nobler than Abi Bakr and Umar.’” Al-Ma’mun asked, “How could Ali have said that he will punish one for whom punishment is ِnot decreed? If so, he would have transgressed the limits of the Honorable the Exalted God, and have acted against His orders. Considering him (Ali (a.s.)) to be nobler than those two is not an accusation, either. You yourselves have narrated that your leader (Abu Bakr) said, ‘I have become your master, but I am not any better than you are.’ Then tell me which of these two men do you consider to be more honest? Which one do you consider to be correct: what Abu Bakr said about himself or what Ali said about Abi Bakr? And yet there is a contradiction in this tradition. We have to say that either Abi Bakr is honest in what he says, or he is not. If he is honest, we must ask from where he got to know that. Was it through revelation or did he just think it up himself? If you say that it was due to revelation, we know that the revelations stopped (after the Prophet (S)). And if you say that it was what he himself thought, it cannot be so since we know that there is no way one could think of such things. If you say that he was dishonest, then it is impossible for such a dishonest person to be in charge of the affairs of the Muslims, to uphold the decrees and exercise Divinely-Ordained Punishments.”Someone else said, “It has been narrated that the Prophet (S) said, ‘Abu Bakr and Umar are the Masters of the Elders in Paradise.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible, since once an old lady called Ashja’iyya was with the Prophet (S) and the Prophet (S) said, ‘An old lady does not enter Paradise.’ She cried. Then the Prophet (S) said, ‘In fact, the Sublime God says, ‘We have created (their Companions) of special Creation. And made them virgin - pure (and undefiled), beloved (by nature), equal in age.’’ Thus you think that Abu Bakr is the only one who will become young when he enters Paradise, while you yourselves have narrated that God’s Prophet (S) told Al-Hassan (a.s.) and Al-Husayn (a.s.) that amongst all the people they are the Masters of Youth in Paradise; and that their father is even better than they are.’”Someone else said, “It has been narrated that the Prophet (S) said, ‘If I were not appointed from amongst you, then Umar would have been appointed.’” Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible since the Sublime God says, ‘We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him…’ Moreover, the Sublime God says, ‘And remember We took from the Prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant.’ How could it then be possible for someone for whom there has been (taken) a covenant (from) not to become a Prophet, and someone else without a covenant become a Prophet?’”Someone else said, “The Prophet (S) looked at Umar on the Day of Arafat, smiled and said, ‘The Blessed the Sublime God is proud of His servants in general, and is especially proud of Umar.’ Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible since the Blessed the Sublime God would not be especially proud of Umar and leave out His Prophet (S) as if Umar is someone especial, and the Prophet is like the rest of the people. This is not stranger than another one of your traditions in which you claim that God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘I entered Paradise and heard the sound of some sandals. When I looked around, I saw Bilal - the servant of Abi Bakr who had come to Paradise before me.’ Yes, the Shiites say that Ali is betterthan Abi Bakr, but you claim that the servant of Abi Bakr is nobler than the Prophet (S) since whoever comes first is better. You have also narrated that Satan runs away even from the shadow of Umar and also claim that Satan induced the Prophet (S) to say, ‘These idols are the Majestic Peacocks.’ You think that Satan fled even from Umar’s shadow, but induced expressions of atheism in the words of the Prophet (S).”Someone else said, “The Prophet (S) has said, ‘Should the penalty descend no one but Umar ibn al-Khattab will be saved.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is in complete contradiction with the text of the Book. In fact, the Sublime God told His Prophet (S), ‘But Allah was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongst them…’ You are setting up Umar to be like the Prophet (S).”Someone else said, “The Prophet (S) has testified that Umar is one of the ten companions who will be in Paradise.”Al-Ma’mun said, “Were it as you claim, Umar would have never asked Huthayfa, ‘I swear to you by God to tell me if I am one of the hypocrites?’ Had the Prophet (S) told him that he was going to Paradise, would he have denied what God’s Prophet (S) had said and ask that from Huthayfa? Then it could be seen that he acknowledged Huthayfa and not the Prophet (S) which is in opposition to being a Muslim. And if he had acknowledged the Prophet (S), why then did he ask that from Huthayfa? Thus these two traditions contradict each other.”Someone else said, “In fact, the Prophet (S) said, ‘They weighed me against my nation, and I weighed more. Then they put Abu Bakr in my place and he weighed more than me. Then they put Umar in my place and he weighed more than Abu Bakr. Then they took away the scale.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is also impossible. Either they measured their weight or they measured their deeds. If they measured their weights, it is not acceptable that they weighed more than the whole nation. And if they weighed their deeds, the deeds of all the nation were available to weigh at that time. Still those Muslims were not created to have done any deeds. Tell me, how did they outweigh the nation?” Some said, “According to their good deeds.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me, would someone who had more noble deeds after the demise of the Prophet (S)attain the same position as those who lived at the time of the Prophet (S), but had done less noble deeds? If you answer in the affirmative, I know of some people today whose good deeds - participation in a holy war, visiting the Kaaba (i.e. House of God), fasting, praying and giving charity - are much more than those who lived at the time of the Prophet (S).” They said, “You are right. The noble ones of our times are as noble as the noble ones at the time of the Prophet (S).” Al-Ma’mun replied, “Then consider what your religious leaders from whom you have learned your religion - have told you about the nobilities of Ali (a.s.); and what they have said about the ten companions whom they have promised to be sure to go to Paradise and compare them. If you see that their deeds are slightly nobler, then what you say is right. However, if you see that what they have narrated about Ali’s nobilities is more, then accept what your religious leaders have said about Ali and do not deviate from that.”The narrator added, “All of them lowered their heads.” Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “Why have you become silent?” They said, “We are finished asking questions.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then let me ask. What was the most rewarding deed on the day in which God appointed His Prophet (S)?” They said, “Rushing ahead of others in accepting Islam since the Sublime God says, ‘And those Foremost (in Faith) will be Foremost (in the Hereafter). These will be those Nearest to Allah.’”Al-Ma’mun asked, “Do you know of anyone who accepted Islam before Ali did?”The man said, “That is right, but he was still too young to accept Islam. Abu Bakr was older and the decree was designated for him (to be the Caliph). There is some difference between these two conditions.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me whether Ali’s acceptance of Islam was due to Divine Inspirations from the Sublime God, or was it just due to the invitation of the Prophet (S)? If you say that it was due to receiving inspirations, you have placed him above the Prophet (S) since the Prophet (S) did not receive any inspirations. It was Gabriel who descended (from Heaven) and delivered the messages of the Sublime God to him (a.s.). However, if you say that it was due to the Prophet’s invitation, tell me whether the Prophet (S) invited Ali (a.s.) out of his own will or was his invitation according to God’s order. If you say that it was due to the invitation of the Prophet (S) himself, this would contradict how theSublime God describes His Prophet (S) when He says, ‘…nor am I a pretender’ or when He says, ‘Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire. It is no less than inspiration sent down to him.’ If you say that it was due to God’s order, then God has ordered him to choose Ali (a.s.) from amongst all the children of the people to invite (to Islam). Therefore, the Prophet (S) has invited Ali (a.s.) to Islam due to trusting him and his being approved of by the Sublime God.On the other hand, tell me whether the Wise God would oblige His creatures to do what would be beyond their own power to do? If you answer in the affirmative, then you are an atheist. If, however, you answer in the negative, how would God order His Prophet (S) to invite someone (to Islam) who cannot accept the decree due to his being too young and not able to accept )the invitation)? Moreover, have you ever seen the Prophet (S) invite (to Islam) any other children from his family or outside his family to be designated as a model for Ali (a.s.)? If you think that the Prophet (S) has not invited any other child but Ali (a.s.) to Islam, then this itself would designate that Ali (a.s.) is nobler than all other children.” Al-Ma’mun then added, “Tell me, what would be the noblest deed after having faith.” They said, “Fighting in the way of God.” He said, “Do you know of a record of fighting in the way of God for any of those ten (companions) similar to that of Ali’s record in fighting with atheists and enemies in all the battles which the Prophet (S) conducted in history? Consider the Battle of Badr in which a total of a few more than sixty people were killed. Ali (a.s.) killed more than twenty of them himself, while all the other people killed nearly forty of them.” One of those present in the meeting said, “Abu Bakr was in his own tent along with the Prophet (S) and was directing the battle.” Al-Ma’mun said, “What a strange thing you are saying! Did Abu Bakr plan the battles by himself and without the Prophet (S), or did he participate in the planning along with the Prophet (S), or was it the case that the Prophet (S) needed Abu Bakr’s opinion and leadership? Which of the three cases do you prefer to choose?” The man said, “I take refuge in God from thinking that he participated along with the Prophet (S) in planning the battles, or that he himself decided what to do without the Prophet (S), or that the Prophet (S) needed his opinion.” Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “Then what is the nobility of sitting in a tent and watching the fighters? If the nobility of Abu Bakr was due to his abandoning holy war and not going to thebattlefield, then we must say that all of those who disobey (God) and do not go to the battlefield are nobler than those who fight. The Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath God promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward.’”Ishaq ibn Hammad ibn Zayd said, “Al-Ma’mun then told me to recite the Qur’anic Chapter Insan. I recited it, ‘Has there not been over Man a long period of Time, when he was nothing…’ until I reached the following verse, ‘And they feed, for the love of Allah, the indigent, the orphan, and the captive.’ And I continued reciting the Chapter up to (a.s.aying), “Verily this is a Reward for you, and your Endeavor is accepted and recognized.” Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “About whom were these verses recited?” I said, “About Ali.” He asked, “Do you know of any traditions in which it is narrated that while Ali (a.s.) fed the poor and assisted the orphans and the captives, he said, ‘We feed you for the sake of Allah alone: no reward do we desire from you, nor thanks’ as it appears in the Qur’an?” I said, “No.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then the Honorable the Exalted God was aware of what went on within Ali’s (a.s.) heart and expressed it in His Book to make it known to His creatures.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Do you understand what the Sublime God describes when He describes Paradise in this verse saying, ‘Crystal-clear, made of silver: they will determine the measure thereof (according to their wishes).’” I said, “No.” He said, “This is another nobility. How could there be any crystal-clear silver?” Ishaq said, “I do not know.” Al-Ma’mun replied, “He wants us to imagine silver so clear that one can see its inside from the outside. O Ishaq! This is similar to what the Prophet of God (a.s.) said, ‘O slower! Be more patient with these crystal-clear ones’ referring to ladies due to their being so delicate. It is also similar to what the Prophet of God (a.s.) said, ‘I rode Abu Talha’s horse and found it like a sea’ implying that it galloped very fast just as the sea waves do. And as the Sublime God says, ‘…death will come to him from every quarter, yet will he not die: and in front of him will be a chastisement unrelenting’ even though he will die even if death comes to him from just one side.”Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “O Ishaq! Are you not one of those who testify that those ten (companions) are in Paradise?” I said, “yes.” He said, “If you saw that someone did not know whether this tradition was correct or not, would you consider him to be an atheist?” I said, “No.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “What if he asks whether this Chapter is from the Qur’an or not, will you then consider him to be an atheist?” I said, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then I consider the nobility of this man (Ali (a.s.)) to be more. O Ishaq! Tell me if you consider the tradition about the fried chicken (which was brought for the Prophet (S)) to be correct or not?” I said, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “By God, your animosity can be seen from this. There are only three possibilities. It is either that he was accepted due to the supplications of the Prophet (S), or he was rejected, or that God could not recognize between the noble one and the others. Tell me, which one do you like the most?” Ishaq said, “I kept my head down for some time and then I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! The Sublime God said the following regarding Abi Bakr: He had no more than one companion; the two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, ‘Have no fear, for Allah is with us’: then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in Might, Wise.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “Glory be to God! How little is your knowledge of the Book? Can an atheist be a companion of a believer? What kind of nobility is this? Didn’t you hear the Words of the Sublime God, ‘His companion said to him, in the course of the argument with him: Dost thou deny Him Who created thee out of dust, then out of a sperm-drop, then fashioned thee into a man?’ Thus you see that God made an atheist a believer’s companion. Or according to the following poems from al-Hothali:The morning came and the horse which I rode was wildIt saw the East from beneath its cover.Or as Al-Azdi said,I was frightened about being alone there with my only companion,being a gentle, tall, four-legged animal with thin forelegs.Here the poet has likened his horse to his companion. And when the Sublime God says, ‘…for God is with us…’ means that the Blessed the Sublime God is with every good-doer and every evil-doer. Have you not heard the Words of the Sublime God, ‘Seest thou not that Allah doth know (all) that is in the heavens and on earth? There is not a secret consultation between three, but He makes the fourth among them, nor between five but He makes the sixth, nor between fewer nor more, but He is in their midst, wheresoever they be: In the end will He tell them the truth of their conduct, on the Day of Judgment. For Allah has full knowledge of all things.’ And regarding His words, ‘Have no fear…’ Tell me about the fears of Abi Bakr. Were they said in obedience, or disobedience? If you consider them to be said in obedience, you have said that the Prophet (S) admonished him against obedience. However, this contradicts what a wise person would do. And if you think that he has disobeyed, then what is the nobility of one who is disobedient? Tell me, upon whom did God send down peace in the following Words of the Sublime God, ‘…then Allah sent down His peace upon him…’”Ishaq replied, “To Abi Bakr since the Prophet (S) did not need any peace. The Prophet (S) was not afraid.”He said, “Let me know about the Words of the Honorable the Exalted, ‘Assuredly Allah did help you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain: Behold! your great numbers elated you, but they availed you naught: the land, for all that it is wide, did constrain you, and ye turned back in retreat. But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers…’”Al-Ma’mun asked, “Do you know who is meant by the believers to whom the Sublime God refers in this verse?” I said, “I do not know.” Al-Ma’mun said, “On the day of the Battle of Hunain the people fled from the battlefield. Only seven people from the Hashemites stayed with the Prophet of God (a.s.). They consisted of Ali (a.s.) who fought with his sword, Abbas who held the horse-strap for the Prophet of God (a.s.), and five others who surrounded the Prophet (S) fearing that the pagans might strike him (a.s.) with their weapons, until the Blessed the Sublime God granted victory to His Messenger (a.s.). Therefore, the reference to the believers in this verse is to Ali (a.s.) and those of the Hashemites who stayed there. Then who is nobler? The one (Ali (a.s.)) who was with theProphet (S) and peace descended upon him and the Prophet (S), or the one (Abu Bakr) who was with the Prophet (S) in the cave, but was not deserving enough for peace to be descended upon? O Ishaq! Which one is nobler? The one (Abu Bakr) who was in the cave with the Prophet (S) or the one (Ali (a.s.)) who slept in the Prophet’s (a.s.) bed sacrificing himself to allow the Prophet (S) to complete his Emigration. In fact, the Blessed the Sublime God ordered His Prophet (S) to order Ali (a.s.) to sleep in the Prophet’s (a.s.) bed, so that the Prophet’s (a.s.) life would be saved. Ali (a.s.) asked, “O the Prophet of GOD! Will you be saved this way?” The Prophet (S) said, “Yes.” Then Ali (a.s.) said, “I hear and obey.” Then he slept in the Prophet’s (a.s.) bed and wrapped a sheet around himself. The pagans surrounded the house and went in. They had no doubt that the Prophet (S) was there. One man from each tribe had come there to each deliver a blow to the Prophet (S), so that the Hashemites could not demand retribution. Ali (a.s.) heard their plans and knew that his life was in danger. However, nothing could scare him as Abu Bakr was scared in the cave. Yet, Abu Bakr was with the Prophet (S) while Ali was there alone. Ali (a.s.) was patient and steadfast. The Sublime God sent down angels to guard him from the evils of the Quraysh (tribe) enemies. When dawn came, they saw him, looked at him and asked, “Where is Muhammad?” Ali (a.s.) replied, “I do not know.” They said, “You have tricked us.” Ali (a.s.) joined the Prophet (S) later. Thus it was Ali (a.s.) who was nobler and good deeds were done by him day after day, until the Sublime God took his life and he was well forgiven by Him.”Al-Ma’mun asked, “O Ishaq! Have you not been the one who narrated the tradition on Mastery?” Ishaq said, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Please narrate it for me.” Ishaq narrated it for him. Al-Ma’mun said, “Don’t you see that this tradition established a right for Ali (a.s.) incumbent upon Abi Bakr and Umar, but has not established any rights for those two incumbent upon Ali (a.s.)?” Ishaq said, “The people say that God’s Prophet (S) has said this the following regarding Zayd ibn Haritha.” He asked, “Where and when did the Prophet (S) say this?” I said, “In the Ghadir Khom fter returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage of the Kaaba.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Where was Zayd ibn Haritha killed?” I said, “In Mo’ta.” He said, “Was Zayd ibn Haritha not killed before the Qadir Khom instance?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Tell me, what if your fifteen year old son says, ‘O people! Accept that my servant belongs to my cousin.’ Willyou be hurt from this?” I said, “Yes. I will not like that and tell him.” He said, “You tell your son not to say what you believe that the Prophet of God did. Woe be to you who have taken your jurisprudents as your Masters! In fact, the Sublime God says, ‘They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of Allah…’ Yet I swear by God that they neither fasted for them nor did they pray to them. They only obeyed whatever they said. Then Al-Ma’mun added, “Have you narrated the tradition in which God’s Prophet (S) told Ali (a.s.), “Your position relative to me is as same as Aaron’s position relative to Moses.” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Don’t you know that Aaron was Moses’ brother from the side of both his father and mother?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Was Ali the same?” I said, “No.” He said, “Aaron was a Prophet but Ali (a.s.) was not. Then what was the third rank which he (a.s.) had other than that of being the successor? This was said because the hypocrites said, ‘It was hard for the Prophet (S) to take Ali with him and left him (a.s.) behind while the Prophet (S) wanted him to remain there with peace of mind and that is why he (a.s.) said that. This is similar to what Moses (a.s.) told Aaron as said by the Sublime God, ‘Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief.’ I told him, “But Moses (a.s.) left Aaron to be his successor for all his people while Moses (a.s.) was alive and just went to meet his Lord - the Sublime. But the Prophet (S) left Ali (a.s.) as his successor only when he (a.s.) went to the battles.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me. Were there some of his companions along with him when Moses (a.s.) left Aaron as his successor to go to meet his Lord - the Honorable the Exalted?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Did he not establish him as his successor for all of them?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “The Prophet (S) also established Ali (a.s.) as his successor for the weak ones, the women and the children when he (a.s.) went to the battlefield while most of his people were along with him. However, the Prophet (S) appointed Ali (a.s.) to be the successor over all of them. Moreover, the proof that he (a.s.) appointed Ali (a.s.) to be his (a.s.) successor over them during his lifetime when he was not there, and after his demise is that the Prophet (S) said, ‘The position of Ali relative to me is like that of Aaron’s position relative to Moses with the only difference that there will be no more Prophets after me.’ Therefore, according to this expression, Ali (a.s.) is like the prime minister for the Prophet (S), since Moses (a.s.) prayed to the Sublime God and in his prayers and said, ‘And give me a Minister from my family - Aaron, my brother, add to mystrength through him.’ So Ali (a.s.) was to the Prophet (S) like Aaron was to Moses (a.s.). Aaron was the Moses’ Minister, and Ali (a.s.) was the Successor of the Prophet (S) as Aaron was the Successor of Moses (a.s.).” Then Al-Ma’mun looked at the theoreticians and the rhetoricians and asked, “Should I ask you questions or will you ask me?” They said, “We will ask.” He said, “Go ahead and ask.” One of them asked, “Is it not that the Divine Leadership of Ali (a.s.) as expressed by the Prophet of God (a.s.) similar to his expression of the other obligatory deeds such as ‘There are four units for the noon prayer’ or ‘The alms tax for two hundred Dirhams is five Dirhams’ or ‘Go on the pilgrimage to Mecca?’” Al-Ma’mun said, “Yes.” He asked, “Why then are there no differences of opinion about the obligatory deeds, but there are differences concerning the Successorship of Ali?” Al-Ma’mun said, “That is because the obligatory deeds are not such that the people would all compete with each other over them, but there is competition over becoming the successor.”Another one asked, “Why do you deny that the Prophet (S) ordered that the people be allowed to choose someone from amongst themselves to be his successor due to the compassion and kindness which the Prophet (S) had for his nation, and did not appoint a Successor for himself whom the people would disobey as a result of which punishment would descend upon them?” Al-Ma’mun said, “The reason I deny this is because the Sublime God is kinder to His creatures than the Prophet (S). God appointed a Prophet (S) for the people, but did not let them choose him themselves - even though He knew that there were some people among them who would disobey him and there were others who would obey him. This did not prevent the Sublime God from sending the Prophet (S). Another reason is that there would be two possibilities if God had let the people themselves choose a man (to be their Prophet). Either God orders all of them to choose someone or God orders only some of them to choose someone (to be the Prophet). If God orders all of them to choose someone, then no one could be considered to have free will and be free to choose (a.s.ince they are all ordered to vote for someone else). And if God has ordered only some of them to choose someone to be their Prophet, then the ones who are ordered to choose the Prophet must have some significant traits. If you say that they are the jurisprudents, then the significant signs of jurisprudents should be clarified.” Another one said, “It has been narrated that the Prophet (S) said, ‘In the presence of theSublime God, whatever the Muslims consider to be good is good. In the presence of the Sublime God, whatever the Muslims consider to be evil is evil.’” Al-Ma’mun said, “Here we must see whether the Prophet (S) meant all the believers or only some of them. If we say that the Prophet (S) meant all the believers, then this is an impossible thing. And if we think that the Prophet (S) meant only some of them, then as we know each group says something is good. This is like the traditions which the Shiites have narrated about Ali (a.s.), and the non-Shiites have narrated about the others. Then how could that Divine Leadership which is in your mind be proven?”Another one asked, “Is it then permissible to think that the companions of Muhammad (a.s.) made mistakes?” Al-Ma’mun said, “How could we think that they all made a mistake and they were all at a loss, while as you think they considered Divine Leadership neither to be necessary nor a tradition. You think that Divine Leadership is not a necessity in the opinion of the Sublime God, and it is not one of the traditions of His Prophet (S). Then how could what is neither obligatory nor a tradition be a mistake?”Another one said, “Present your reasons if you claim that Ali (a.s.) and no one else deserves the position of Divine Leadership.” Al-Ma’mun said, “I do not claim this, but I confess to it. There are no reasons for what one confesses to. The claimant is him who thinks that he is in charge of all appointments and dismissals, and that he is in charge of everyone. As for reasons, they may be either cited by those of his (Ali’s) peers like Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman and their followers who are all his (Ali’s) enemies, or others whose reasoning has no effect and does not exist at all. Then how could any reasons be presented in such a case?”Another one asked, “What was incumbent upon Ali (a.s.) to do after the demise of the Prophet of God (a.s.)?” Al-Ma’mun said, “That which he (a.s.) did.” The man asked, “Was it not incumbent upon him to declare to the people that he (Ali) is the Divine Leader?” Al-Ma’mun said, “In fact, Divine Leadership is neither in his (Ali’s) hands, nor is it in the hands of the people so that they may choose him or prefer him over others. Rather, it is in the hands of the Sublime God as God told Abraham (a.s.), ‘…I will make thee an Imam to the Nations…’ and as the Sublime God told David (a.s.), ‘O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent onearth…’ And in the case of Adam the Honorable, the Exalted God told His angels, ‘…I will create a vicegerent on earth…’ Therefore, a Divine Leader is appointed by the Sublime God and because of His choice. A Divine Leader is perfect in Creation, from a good family, pure in nature, and innocent throughout life. If it was in one’s own hands, then anyone who was like this was a Divine Leader or deserved to be one; and once he acted against these characteristics he would be dismissed from the position of Divine Leadership automatically. In that case, the appointment and dismissal of the Divine Leader was subject to one’s deeds.”Another one asked, “Then why did you consider Divine Leadership to be a must for Ali (a.s.) after the demise of the Prophet (S)?” Al-Ma’mun said, “Since Ali (a.s.) came into existence with faith from the time of his birth, just like the Prophet (S) had faith from his childhood. Also Ali (a.s.) was free from the deviations of his people (of Quraysh) who had no real reasons for their idol-worshipping, just as the Prophet (S) was free from deviations and idol-worshipping. Idol-worshipping is, in fact, a form of oppression. Any oppressor cannot be a Divine Leader. One who worships idols could not become a leader by the acceptance of all the Muslims. In fact, whoever worships idols has adopted the enemy of God as a god. His decrees would be the decrees of a pagan by the unanimous consensus of all of the nation who bear witness to his atheism, unless they again bear witness that he is no longer an atheist. Whoever once professes to be an atheist should never become a ruler since in that case there would be no differences between one who has professed atheism and a ruler.”Another one asked, “Why did Ali (a.s.) not fight with Abu Bakr and Umar as he (a.s.) did with Mo’awiya?” Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible to ask. They should ask about positive actions, not negative ones. That is they would ask for the reasons if Ali (a.s.) had risen to fight them. They cannot ask the reasons for his not rising. We must see whether the issue of the Mastery of Ali (a.s.) was decreed by God, or by others. If it is the case that it was decreed by the Sublime God, then any doubt in His Plan constitutes atheism as the Sublime God said, ‘But no, by the Lord, they can have no (real) Faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against Thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction.’ Therefore, one’s deeds are due to one’s origin. If the appointment of Ali (a.s.) wasdecreed by the Sublime God, then Ali’s deeds come from Him and the people must be content with (the appointment) and submit to Ali’s orders. Even the Messenger of God (a.s.) quit fighting on the day of Al-Hodaybiyeh, when the pagans prevented him from performing the ‘Umra (recommendable pilgrimage) ceremonies to the House (of God). And once the Prophet (S) brought together his troops, he fought with them as the Sublime God says, ‘…So overlook (any human faults) with gracious forgiveness.’ Then the Honorable the Exalted said, ‘…then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)…’”Another one asked, “If it is the case as you think that the appointment of Ali (a.s.) to the Divine Leadership was decreed by God and it is obligatory to obey him, why is it then not permissible for the Prophets to abandon the (God’s) invitation and the call, but it was permissible for Ali (a.s.) to abandon what he was ordered to do in calling the people to obey him?” Al-Ma’mun said, “We do not claim that Ali (a.s.) had the mission to invite the people as the Messengers (a.s.) did. We consider him to be a sign or link between the Sublime God and His creatures. Whoever obeys Ali (a.s.) is obedient to God, and whoever opposes Ali (a.s.) is disobeying God. Ali (a.s.) would have strived to call the people to obey him if he had found any helpers. Ali is not to blame for not having found any helpers. Those who did not help him are to be blamed, since they were supposed to obey him anyways. However, he was not ordered to fight without having any helpers. He is like the House of God towards which the people go to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. If they do so they have performed what is incumbent upon them to do. If, however, they do not go, it is they who are to blame, not the House of God.”Another one asked, “If it has been made incumbent upon the people that they must have a Divine Leader whom they must obey, why should it be Ali (a.s.) and no one else?” Al-Ma’mun replied, “That is because the Sublime God would not make some vague thing incumbent upon the people, since that is impossible to do. Thus His Messenger (a.s.) must introduce Ali (a.s.) and this obligation to the people, so that there are no more excuses left for the people in the presence of the Honorable the Exalted God. Don’t you see that if the Sublime God had made it incumbent upon the people to fast for one month, but had not specified which month to fast in and had not given any signs to identify it; and ifthe people were left free to use their own intellect to recognize the month in which the Sublime God wanted them to fast, then the people no longer needed any Prophets or Divine Leaders to inform them about what the Prophet said.”Another one asked, “How can you prove that Ali (a.s.) was mature when the Prophet (S) invited him (to accept Islam)? The people think that when he was invited (to accept Islam) he was a child and ordering him to do so was not permitted. The people think that Ali (a.s.) had not reached the age of maturity for men at that time.”Al-Ma’mun replied, “At that time, Ali (a.s.) was either mature enough that God sent His Prophet (S) to him and invited him (to accept Islam) in which case it would be permitted to order him to abide by Divine decrees and perform the obligatory deeds, or Ali (a.s.) was not mature enough for God to sent His Prophet (S) to him - which is not possible for the Prophet (S) to do as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘And if the apostle were to invent any sayings in Our name, We should certainly seize him by his right hand and We should certainly then cut off the artery of his heart.’ Given this, would the Prophet (S) oblige God’s servants (people) to perform what the Blessed the Sublime God has not granted them the power to carry out? This is an impossibility which cannot be. No wise person would order to do so, neither would the Prophet (S). God is so Sublime that He would not order to do what is impossible to do. His Messenger’s (a.s.) rank is also much higher than to order to do what is impossible to do according to the Wisdom of the Wise One (God).”At this point all the people became quiet. Then Al-Ma’mun said, “You asked me questions and argued with me. Can I ask you some questions now?” They replied, “Yes.”Al-Ma’mun said, “Is it not unanimously accepted by the nation that the Prophet (S) said, ‘Whoever purposefully ascribes lies to me has prepared his seating place in the Fire (in the Hereafter)’?” They replied, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Have they not also narrated on the authority of the Prophet (S) that he (a.s.) said, ‘Whoever disobeys God - be it a minor sin or a major sin - and sets that to be his way and insists on it would reside in Fire (in the Hereafter)’?” They replied, “Yes.”Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me if it is permissible to consider someone that the people have chosen as their leader to be called the successor of God’sProphet (S) or not. Is it permissible to consider him to be appointed by the Honorable the Exalted God even though the Prophet (S) has not established him to be his successor? If you say ‘yes it is permitted’ you are undoubtedly deceitful. If you say ‘no’ then it is a necessary conclusion that Abu Bakr be not considered to be the successor to God’s Prophet (S) nor was he appointed to the position of Caliphate by the Honorable the Exalted God. Thus you have ascribed lies to God’s Prophet (S) and are possibly of those that the Prophet (S) said would enter the Fire. Then tell me which of the following that you say is true: ‘The Prophet passed away without establishing a successor for himself’, or that you call Abu Bakr ‘O successor of God’s Prophet (S)!’ If you claim that both of these statements are true, such a claim is not possible to make since these are contradictory statements both of which cannot be true at the same time. And if you consider one to be true, then you have disproved the other one. Therefore, fear God and consider your own conditions. Do not imitate others. Avoid what is doubtful. I swear by God that the Sublime God would not accept any opinions expressed by His servants, unless they are the result of contemplation and the intellect approves of its being right. Having opposing ideas (about something) is being doubtful. It is not considered to be certitude. Having continual doubt is denying the Sublime God, and would result in dwelling in the Fire.”Al-Ma’mun added, “Tell me if it is permissible for a slave which one buys to become his master, and the buyer becomes a slave.” They said, “No.” He added, “How is it then possible for someone around whom you have gathered, supported him and put him in charge of the Caliphate be your master while you are the ones who have granted him the mastery over you? Will it not be the case that you are his masters? You have made someone to be the Caliph and have then said that he is the successor to the Prophet of God (a.s.). Moreover, once you get discontented with him you would kill him, as you did with Uthman ibn Affan.”Someone said, “That is because the Imam is an agent for the Muslims as long as they are pleased with him. They can dismiss him whenever they are displeased with him.”Al-Ma’mun asked, “To whom do the Muslims, the servants (people) and the towns belong?” They replied, “To the Sublime God.” Al-Ma’munsaid, “Then God is more deserving to appoint an agent over His servants (people) and towns than anyone else, since one of the unanimously accepted principles among the nation is that whoever causes any harm to someone else’s property is held responsible for that, and no one is allowed to usurp the rights over anyone else’s property and he will be sinful and held responsible if he does so.”Then Al-Ma’mun added, “Tell me if the Prophet (S) left anyone as his successor when he died.” They answered, “No, he did not appoint any successor.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Was not doing so guidance or deviation?” They said, “It was guidance.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then it is incumbent upon the people to follow guidance, and not become deviated.” They said, “They did so.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Why then did they appoint a successor after the Prophet (S), even though the Prophet (S) had not done so? Abandoning his way is in itself a form of deviation. It is impossible for what is against guidance to be guidance. If not appointing a successor is considered to be a form of guidance, then why did Abu Bakr appoint a successor for himself when the Prophet (S) had not done so? Umar also referred this issue to the council among the Muslims which was against what his friend (Abu Bakr) had done. You think that the Prophet (S) did not appoint a successor for himself, but Abu Bakr appointed a successor for himself, and Umar did not abandon appointing a successor as the Prophet (S) had done. And as you think Umar did not appoint himself a successor as Abu Bakr had done and used a third approach. Tell me, which of these do you consider to be correct. If you consider what the Prophet (S) did to be correct, then you have considered Abu Bakr to have done wrong. The same holds true for the other options. Tell me, which of these ways is correct. Is what the Prophet (S) did in not appointing a successor correct, or is what the others did who somehow appointed a successor for themselves correct? Tell me, whether not appointing a successor by the Prophet (S) is guidance, and appointing a successor by the other ones is also guidance. Thus guidance is the opposite of guidance. Then what does deviation mean? Where is it? Tell me whether there have been any successors from amongst the Prophet’s (a.s.) companions who have been appointed as the successor with a unanimous consensus after the Prophet’s demise.” Al-Ma’mun added, “If you say no, then you have surely decided that all the people have gone the wrong way after the demise of God’s Prophet (S).And if you say yes, then you have refuted the opinion of the whole nation and what you say will void undeniable things. Tell me whether what the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Say: ‘To whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth?…’ is true or false?” They said, “It is true.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Is it not true that whatever is not with God belongs to God, since He is its creator and owner?” They replied, “Yes.” He said, “This disproves what you have made incumbent yourselves being to appoint a successor for God’s Prophet (S), so that the successor’s decrees are in effect regarding you and that you consider him to be a Caliph. You put him out of office whenever you get mad at him. You kill him if he refuses to give up his power. Woe be to you! Do not ascribe lies to God, since you will face its punishment when you stand in the presence of the Sublime God, and go to see God’s Prophet (S) having purposefully ascribed lies to him. The Prophet (S) has said, “Whoever purposefully ascribes lies to me will encounter his place prepared in the Fire.”Then Al-Ma’mun faced the prayer direction (the Qibla), raised his hands and said, “O God! I advised them and did not hesitate to tell them what I had to say. O God! I did not leave them in doubt. O God! In the interests of my religion I sought to get close to you by preferring Ali over others after your Prophet Muhammad (S), just as your Messenger had ordered us to do.” The narrator said, “Then we all dispersed and there was never again such a congregation for as long as Al-Ma’mun lived.”Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Imran al-Ash’ari said, “In another tradition we read that all the people became quiet. Then Al-Ma’mun asked, ‘Why have you become quiet?’ They said, ‘We do not know what to say.’ Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Therefore, this much debate suffices and you were convinced.’ Then he ordered that everyone be directed out. We were all directed out in a state of being confused and ashamed. Then Al-Ma’mun looked at Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl and said, ‘This is all that they had to say. No one should think that my majesty prevented them from rejecting what I said. God is the One who grants success.’”",

    "englishText": "5. Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan said: Ahmad ibn Yahya said, on the authority of Bakr ibn `Abd Allah ibn Hubayb that Ahmad ibn Ya`qub ibn Matar related to me that Muhammad ibn alHasan bin `Abd al-`Aziz al-Ahdab al-Jund said in Naysabur that I found in my father’s book in his writing: Talhah ibn Yazid said, on the authority of `Ubayd Allah ibn `Ubayd, on the authority of Abu Ma`mar al-Sa`dani that A man came to the Commander of the Faithful `Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) and said: “O Commander of the Faithful! Verily, I have doubted the Revealed Book of Allah.” The Imam (AS) replied to him, “May your mother be bereaved of you! How did you come to doubt the Revealed Book of Allah?” He said: “Because I find some parts of the Book belie some other parts then how should I not doubt in it.?” Consequently, `Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) replied, “Verily, when it comes to the Book of Allah, some parts of it verify other parts. However, you have not been given the sustenance of wisdom to benefit form it. Bring me what you doubt in the Book of Allah, the Mighty and High.” The man explained to him (AS), “I found Allah saying that So today We forget them, as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, also: They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them, and said: And your Lord is not forgetful. Thus, once He informs that He does forget and in another place He says that He does not forget. O Commander of the Faithful, what is that?” Imam `Ali (AS) said: “Bring me what you doubt in.” He said: I have found Allah saying that The Day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks; they shall not speak except he whom the Most Compassionate God permits and who speaks the right thing, He says: (they will speak) They would say: By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheist, He says: On the Resurrection Day some of you shall deny others, and some of you shall curse others, then He says: That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the fire, He says: Do not quarrel in My Presence, and indeed I gave you the threatening beforehand, and He says: We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what t hey earned. Therefore, on one occasion He says that they will speak, and on another occasion He says: “they will not speak except he whom the Most Compassionate permits and who speaks the right thing.” In one place He informs that the creation will not speak and describes their statement: “By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheist.” In another place He says that they will quarrel. O Commander of the Faithful, why is that? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear (from me)? The Imam said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” He responded, I also find Allah, the Mighty and High saying that Faces on that day shall be bright, looking to their Lord, and he says: Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends (all) vision; and He is the Knower of Subtleties, the Aware, He says: And certainly he saw him in another descent, a the farthest lotus-tree; He also says: On that day shall no intercession avail except of him whom the Beneficent Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do not comprehend it in knowledge. Whoever the eyes have perceived is encompassed in knowledge. O Commander of Faithful, why is that? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man uttered, I also find Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, that And it is not for any man that Allah should speak to him save by revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger (angel) and to reveal by His permission what He wills, He also says: And to Musa, Allah addressed His Word, speaking (to him), and He says: And their Lord called out to them, and He says, O Prophet! Say to your wives and your daughters and He also says: O Messenger! Deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord. Why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man further said: I find Allah, High be His Praise, saying that Do you know anyone else named with the same names? He names the human as hearing [sami`], seeing [basir`], sovereign [malik], lord [rabb]. Therefore, at times He says that He has many common names, and at other times He says: “do you know anyone else named with the same name?” Why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And ho shall I not doubt in what you hear?” The Imam said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” He said: I found Allah, the Blessed and Exalted saying, that And there does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an atom in the earth or in heaven, and that nor will He look upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them, and also that Nay! Most surely they shall on that day be veiled from their Lord. How does He look at them when they are veiled? And why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) replied, “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” He continued, And I find Allah, the Might and High, saying that Are you secure of those in heaven and He should not make the earth to swallow you up, and that The Most Compassionate Allah is firm on the Empyrean, and also that And He is Allah in heavens and in the earth; He knows your secrets and your disclosures, and that The Manifested and the Hidden, and that He is with you wherever you may be, and also that We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And ho shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) said: “Woe unto you! Bring me more what you doubt in.” The man further said: I find Allah, High be His praise, saying that And your Lord comes and (also) the angels in ranks, and he said: Verily, you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and said: They do not wait aught but that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds along with the angels, and also said: They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come. On the day when some of the Signs of your Lord shall come, its faith shall not profit a soul which did no believe before, or earn good through its faith. Thus, in one place He says: “On the Day your Lord should come” and in another place He says: “on the Day some of the Signs of your Lord should come.” Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man continued, And I find Allah, the Mighty and High, saying that Nay! They are unbelievers in the meeting of their Lord, and when He mentioned the Believer, He said: Who know that they shall meet their Lord and that they shall return to Him, and said: Their greetings on the Day when they meet Him shall be: “Peace,” and He also said: Whoever hopes to meet Allah, then meeting Him is forthcoming, and said: Therefore, whoever hope to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds. Thus, in one occasion, He says that they will meet Him, and on other occasion, He says that vision cannot perceive Him, and that He perceives all vision. And at another time He says: “They cannot encompass Him with knowledge.” Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear The Imam (AS) said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man said: I found Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, that And the guilty shall see the fire, then they shall think that they are going to fall into it, and He said: On that day Allah will pay back to them in full their just reward, and they shall know that Allah is the evident Truth, and He also said: You began to think diverse thoughts of Allah. So in one place He says that “they think,” and in another place He says that “they know.” Thinking [zann] is doubt. Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you heard? The Imam (AS) said: “Bring me what you doubt in.” The man said: I find Allah, the Exalted, saying that And We will set up a just balance on the Day of Resurrection, so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and He said: Therefore, We will not set up a balance for them on the Day of Resurrection, and He also said: These shall enter the garden, in which they shall be given sustenance without measure, and He also said: And the measuring out on the that day will be just; then as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is heavy, those are they who shall be successful; and as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is light those are they who have made their souls suffer loss because they were unjust towards Our signs. Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) replied, “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man said: I found Allah, the Exalted, saying that Say: The Angel of Death who is given charge of you takes your souls, then to your Lord you shall be brought back, and He said: Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and He also said: Our Messengers (angels) take his soul away, and they are not remiss, and also said: Thos whom the angels take away their souls in a good state, and He also said: Those whom the angels take away their souls while they are unjust to themselves. Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? Thus, I shall perish if you do not have mercy on me, and expand my chest for me in what might happen by my hands. For if the Lord, the Blessed and Exalted is truth, the book is truth, and the Messengers are truth, then I have perished and am in loss. However, if the Messengers are false then it does not matter, and I am saved. Consequently, `Ali (AS) said: Our Lord, the Most Holy, Blessed and Exalted be He, is Elevated, and Great. We bear witness that He is the Ever-Lasting who does not decline. We do not doubt in Him, and there is nothing whatsoever like Him, and He is All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. And we bear witness that the Book is truth, the Messengers are truth, and that the reward of Allah and the wrath of Allah are true. Thus, if you are given faith, or faith is taken away from you, then that is Allah’s prerogative. If He wishes to bless you, He will and if He does not wish to, He will not. Nonetheless, I will clarify the issues in which you doubt. There is no strength or power but Allah. If Allah intends good for you, He will grant you guidance through His Knowledge and keep you firm in faith. However, if He wishes evil for you, then certainly you have gone astray and you have perished. As for His Statement: “They forgot Allah so He has forgotten them,” Verily, that means “they forgot Allah in this world.” Since they do not obey Him in this world, He has forgotten them in the Hereafter. In other words, He will not reward them. As such, they have been excluded from good. Similar is the explanation of His Word, the Mighty and High “So today We forget them, as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs.” What He means by “the forgetting” is that He will not reward them like He rewards His Beloved Ones who were obedient to Him in this world, and who remembered Him by professing faith in Him and in His Messengers, and who feared Him in secret. As for His word: “And you Lord id not forgetful” it means that our Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, the Elevated, and the Great, is not forgetful or neglectful, rather, He is the Protecting, the All-Knowing. The Arabs say about forgetfulness: “So and so has forgotten us,” i.e. he does not wish good for us not does he remember us with goodness. As a result, have you understood what Allah, the Mighty and High, has mentioned? The man replied, “Verily, you have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have resolved my problem. May Allah increase your reward! The Imam (AS) continued, As for His Word: “The Day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks; they shall not speak except he whom the Most Compassionate God permits and who speaks the right thing,” and His Word: “By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists,” and His Word: “On the Resurrection Day some of you shall deny others, and some of you shall curse others,” and His Word: “That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the fire,” and His Word: “Do not quarrel in My Presence, and indeed I gave you the threatening beforehand.” And he says: “We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hand shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned.” Verily, these events take place at different times and at different places on the Day that will last fifty thousand years. Allah, the Mighty and High, will bring forth all the creations that Day in different places. Some will speak to others, and some of whom will seek forgiveness for others. They are the obedient ones, and followers of the (righteous) leaders in this world. The disobedient ones will curse. They are the ones who incited hatred, and engaged in oppression and aggression on worldly abode. The empowered ones and the weak ones will deny each other and curse each other. The denial [kufr] in this verse refers to immunity. He is that “some of them shall grant immunity to others.” It is like the statement of Satan in surah “Abraham: ”Verily, I disbelievers in your associating me with Allah before; and the statement of Ibrahim (AS) the Friend of Allah: We renounce you, i.e. we disassociate ourselves for you. Then they will unite in another place where they will cry. If those screams arise for the people of this world, they would certainly startle all of the creation from their livelihood, and their hearts would crack except what Allah wills. Hence, they shall continue to weep bold. Then they will unite in another place where they will be made to speak and say: “By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists.” Therefore, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands, feet and skins will be made to speak. So they will witness every sin which they did with these parts. Then the seal from their tongues will be raised so they will say to their skins: Why have you borne witness against us? They shall say: Allah who makes everything speak has made us speak. Then they unite in another place and will be made to speak, but they will escape from one another. This is the meaning of the Word of the Mighty and High: The day on which a man shall fly from his brother, and his mother and his father, and his spouse and his son. Thus, they will seek to speak but no one shall speak except for whom the Beneficent permits and who speaks the right thing. At this point the Messengers, blessings of Allah be upon them, shall rise and bear witness, to the Word of Allah: How will it be, then, when We bring from every people a witness and bring you as a witness against these? Then they will meet in another place, where there shall be the place of Muhammad (sw) and that is the Praised Position [almuqam al-mahmud]. Thus, he (sw) will praise Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, the way no one has praised Him before him. Then he (sw) will praise each and every angel. There shall not remain any angel that he will not have praised. Then he will praise the Messengers (AS) in such way that no one has done so before him. The he (sw) will praise every believing man and believing woman starting with the strictly veracious [siddiqin], the martyrs, and the pious ones [salihin]. Then all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth will praise him as we see in the Word of Allah: Maybe your Lord will raise you to a praised position. Hence, blessed are those who have any allotment in that Position, and woe unto those who do not have any allotment or share in that Position. Then they will unite in another place, and some of them will vie the upper hand to others. This is all before the Accountability [al-hisab]. Thus, when one is taken to accountability then everyone shall be occupied with what they have before them. We ask Allah for the blessing of that Day. The man responded, “You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful. May Allah comfort you! You have solved my problem. May Allah increase your reward!” The Imam (AS) then continued, As for the Word of the Mighty and High: “Faces on that day shall be bright, looking to their Lord,” and His Word: “Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends (ALL) vision;” and His Word: “and verily he saw him in another descent, at the farthest lotustree;” and His Word also: “On that day shall not intercession avail except of him whom the Most Compassionate Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do not comprehend it in knowledge.” As for His Word: “Faces on that day shall be bright, looking to their Lord” then Verily, that is a place where the Beloved Ones of Allah, the Mighty and High, end up in after they have finished with the accountability to the river which is named al-Hayawan. They will wash in it and drink from it so their faces will be helped to shine. Hence, every floating impurity and difficulty will vanish from them. Then they will be ordered to enter Paradise. From this position they will look at their Lord, how He rewards them and from there they will enter Paradise. That is the Word of the Mighty and High about the salutation of the angels unto them: Peace be on you, you shall be happy; therefore, enter it to abide. At that point, they will be certain of entering Paradise and looking at what their Lord had promised them. Thus, that is the Word of Allah: “looking to their Lord.” Verily, what is meant by “looking at Him” here is “looking at the reward of the Blessed and Exalted.” As for His Word: “Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends vision” then it is just as He said: “vision comprehends Him not,” i.e. the imaginations cannot encompass him. “He comprehends vision” i.e. He encompasses vision “and He is the Knower of subtleties, the Aware.” That is the praise with which our Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, has eulogized and extolled Himself, the Elevated, the High. Musa (AS) asked and the praise of Allah, the Mighty and High, flowed over his tongue: My Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. Thus, his question was a great matter and he had asked for a body matter and, hence, was inflicted. So Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, said: you will not see me in this world until you die, then you will see Me in the Hereafter. However, if you intend to see me in this world then look at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me; therefore, Allah, glory be Him, expressed some of His signs and our Lord manifested to the mountain, the mountain had crumbled and had become dust and Musa fell down in a swoon; i.e. he had died. Thus, his infliction was the death, and then he was brought back to life by Allah and he recovered, he returned and said: Glory be to Thee, I turn to Thee, and I am the first of the Believers, i.e. the first who believed in You and who never say You. As for His Word: And verily he saw him in another descent, at the farthest lotus-tree; i.e. Muhammad (sw) was at the farthest lotus-tree, as no creation from the creation of Allah crosses that position. And Allah’s Word a the end of the verse: The eye did not turn aside, nor did it exceed the limit, certainly he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord. He (sw) saw Jibra’il (AS) in his true form twice, at this time, and at another time. Jibra’il is enormous. He is one of the holy ones [rawhaniyin] whose creation and description cannot be perceived except by Allah, the Lord of the Universe. As for His Word: On that Day shall no intercession avail except of him whom the Most Compassionate Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do no comprehend it in knowledge. The creations cannot comprehend Allah, the Mighty and High, in knowledge, as He is the Blessed and Exalted. He has placed over the vision of the hearts a veil. Thus, no understanding reaches Him in form. Nor any heat proves Him with limits. Therefore, no one attributes Him except with what He has attributed Himself. There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing, the First, the Last, the Manifest, the Hidden, the Creator, the Maker, the Imager. He created all things; none of the things are like Him, the blessed and Exalted. The man said: “You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward, O Commander of the Faithful! The Imam (AS) then added, As for His Word: And it is not for any man that Allah should speak to him save by revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger (angel) and to reveal by His Permission what He wills, and His Word: And to Musa, Allah addressed His Words, speaking (to him), and also His Word: And their Lord called out to them, and His Word: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the garden! As for His Word: “And it is not for any man that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil” for verily it is a must for humankind that Allah may only speak to him through revelation and that is not possible except from behind a veil, or by sending an angel to reveal by His permission what He wills. That is what Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said, the Elevated and high. The Messenger was revealed unto from the angels of heaven, thus, the angels of heave delivered to the angels of the earth. The speech between the angels of the earth and the Messenger did not happen without their speech with the angels of heaven. Hence, the Messenger of Allah (sw) said: “O Jibra’il, have you seen your Lord?” He replied, `Verily, my Lord cannot be seen.” Consequently, the Messenger of Allah (sw) asked, “Then where do you take the revelation from?” He answered, “I take it from Israfil.” He (sw) enquired, “And where does Israfil take it form?” He replied, “He takes it from another angel above him from the divine ones.” The Messenger (sw) asked, “And where does that angel take it from?” He explained,” It is thrown upon his heart.” This is revelation and that is the word of Allah, the Mighty and High, and the word of Allah is not (revealed) in one method; among them is what Allah spoke to the Messengers, among them is what He threw upon their hearts, among them is what the Messengers see in their dreams, among them is inspiration and revelation which is read and delivered. That is the word of Allah. Thus, I will suffice with what I have described for you of Allah’s speech. Verily, the meaning of Allah’s Word is not one. Among them is certainly what the angels of heaven deliver to the angels of the earth. The man said: “You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward, O Commander of the Faithful!” The Imam (AS) then added, As for His Word: Do you know anyone else named with the same name? Verily, the interpretation of that is “do you know anyone else with the name Allah, other than Allah, the Blessed and Exalted.” Be careful not to explain the Qur’an by your personal views unless you deeply understand it from the learned. For verily, there is revelation many a times resembling the word of man, but it is the word of Allah. So its interpretation does not resemble the word of man, like nothing from His Creation resembles Him. Likewise, none of His Actions, the Blessed and Exalted, resemble the actions of man and his Word does not resemble the word of man. Thus, the Word of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted is His Attribute, and the words of man are their actions. Therefore, do not compare the Word of Allah with the word of man for it you do then you shall perish and go astray. The man responded, “You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solve a problem. May Allah increase your reward, O Commander of the Faithful!” Then the Imam (AS) continued, As for His Word: And there does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an atom in the earth or in heaven, that is how our Lord is, nothing lies concealed from Him and how could it, He who created the things would not know what He created, while He is the Creator, the All-Knowing. And as for His Word: nor will he look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, He is informing that He will not bestow upon them good. The Arabs say: “By Allah, so and so does not look upon us.” Verily, what they mean by it is that “he does not bestow us good.” Thus, that is the “look from Allah, the Exalted, to His Creation here. So His Look upon them is His Mercy for them. And for His Word: Nay! Most surely they shall on that day be veiled from their Lord. Verily, what He means by this is “on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be veiled from the reward of their Lord.” The man responded, “You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward!” The Imam (AS) then said: As for His Word: Are you secure of those in heaven that He should not make the earth to swallow you up? And His Word: And He is Allah in heavens and in the Earth; and His Word: The Most Compassionate Allah is firm on the Empyrean, and also His Word: He is with you wherever you may be, and also His Word: We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. Such is Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, the Most Praised, the Most Holy. Exalted is He from what befalls the creations. He is the Subtle, the All-Informed, and far beyond being compared to His Creation. His Knowledge is firm on the Empyrean. He is the Witness to every whisper. He is the Custodian over Everything, the Creator of Everything, and the Director of Everything. Far Exalted is Allah, Elevated and High, from being on His Empyrean! Thus, the Imam (AS) continued, And as for His Word: And you Lord comes and (also) the angels in ranks, and His Word: Verily, you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and also His Word: They do not wait aught but that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds along with the angels, and also His Word: They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come. Verily, this is all truth as Allah, the Mighty and High has said. He does not have a coming like the coming of the creation. I have already taught you that there is something from the Book of Allah, interpretation of which is other than its revelation and it does not resemble the word of man. I will shortly notify you to one of its dimensions and that should suffice you, if Allah willing. From that is the word of Ibrahim (AS): Surely I am going to my Lord; He will guide me. Therefore, his going to His Lord is attention towards Him in service, effort and closeness to Allah, High and Mighty. Do you not see that its interpretation is other than its revelation? He has also said: We sent down the iron, wherein is latent mighty power, i.e. the weapons etc. They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, He is informing Muhammad (sw) about the infidels and the hypocrites who did not respond to Allah and the Messenger. So He said: They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them. As they did not respond to Allah and His Messenger, “or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come.” What He means by this is that the punishment should come to them in this world like He punished the earlier ages. Thus, this is information about them He is giving to the Prophet (sw). Then He says: On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith. That is, before this sing comes, this sign is rising of the sun from the west; Verily, it would suffice the ones with intellect, brain and understanding to know that if he removes the veil they will see what they have been promised. He has said in another verse: But Allah came to them whence they did not expect, i.e. He sent unto them a punishment. And like is His Coming to their building as Allah, the Mighty and High, has said: Then Allah came (and demolished) their building from the foundations. Thus, His coming to their buildings from their foundations means sending the punishment over them. Similar is what He has described for the affair of the Hereafter, Blessed and Exalted be His Name, Elevated High. Verily, He will set running His affairs in that Day, which is fifty thousand years long, like He set running His affairs in this world. He does not disappear, nor does He pass with the transitory. Thus, I will suffice with what I have described for you from that which is wandering in your mind of what Allah, the Mighty and High has described in His Book. Do not make His Words like the word of humankind. He is Greater, Mightier, More Generous and Higher, Blessed and Exalted from that which the attributers may attribute. Except with what He attributes Himself in His Word, the Mighty and High: There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The man said: “You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah comfort you! You have soled a problem. May Allah increase your reward! The Imam (AS) then said: As for His Word: Nay! They are unbelievers in the meeting of their Lord, and when He mentioned the Believer: Who know that they shall meet their Lord, and His Word for other than the Believers: Till the day when they shall meet Him because they failed to perform towards Allah what they had promised with Him, and also His Word: Therefore, whoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds. As for His Word: Nay! They are unbelievers in the meeting of their Lord, i.e. the raising from death [al-ba`th] so Allah, the Mighty and High, has named it His Meeting. Likewise, He has mentioned the Believers: Who know that they shall meet their Lord, i.e. they are certain that they will be raised, gathered, accounted and paid with the reward or punishment. Therefore, the word zann (strong belief) in this context specifically is “certainty.” Like is His Word: Therefore, whoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds. And His Word: Whoever hopes to meet Allah, then meeting Him is forthcoming, i.e. whoever believes that he will be raised from death, then verily Allah’s promise about the reward and punishment is forthcoming. Hence, here “the meeting” is not “the viewing.” In fact, it is the raising from death. So understand this that verily all of “His Meeting” in the Book of Allah is meant to be “the raising from death.” And similar is His Word: their greetings on the Day when they meet Him shall be: “Peace,” i.e. that “the faith will not decline from their hearts the Day when they are raised again.” The man said: “You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah comfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward!” At that time the Imam (AS) said: As for His Word: And the guilty shall see the fire, then they shall think that they are going to fall into it, i.e. they will be certain that they are going to enter it. Similar is His Word: Surely I knew that I shall meet my account, He is saying that I am certain that I will be raised and then accounted for. Similar is His Word: On that Day Allah will pay back to them in full their just reward, and they shall know that Allah is the Evident Truth. And as for His Word about the hypocrites: “You began to think diverse thought of Allah,” then this zann is doubt and not certainty. Zann is of two types: doubt and surety. Therefore, that which is a matter of the Hereafter, then that is “the certainty” and that which is of a worldly matter is “the doubt.” Pay attention to what I have explained for you. The man said: “You have comfort me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah comfort you!” The Imam (AS) explained, And so for His Word, the Blessed and Exalted: And We will set up a just balance on the Day of Resurrection, so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; that is the balance of justice, all the creations will be taken to it on the Day of Judgment. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will grant credit to some of the creation from others with the balances. The compiler of this book says: In another tradition “the balance” stands for the Prophets and their Successors (sw) (this one sentence is by the Compiler. The passages after it are the continuation of the tradition.) And as for His Word, the Mighty and High: Therefore, We will not set up a balance for them on the Day of Resurrection, verily this is specifically. And as for His Word: These shall enter the garden, in which they shall be given sustenance without measure. Verily, the Messenger of Allah (sw) has said: Allah, the Mighty and High, says: “Those who observe Me and love one another for My Glory, deserve My love,” or he said, “My honor. Verily, on the Day of Judgment their faces will be of the light on the pulpits of light, over which shall be green cloths.” It was asked; “Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?” He replied: “A group of people who are neither Prophets, not martyrs, but they are ones who loved one another for the Glory of Allah. They will enter Paradise without any accountability.” We ask Allah, the Mighty and High, to make us of them for His Mercy. As for His Word: then as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is heavy…and as for him, whose measure (of good deeds) is light, i.e. verily, it means the accountability. The good deeds and the bad deeds will be weighed. The good deeds cause the balance to be weighty and the bad deeds cause the balance to be light. Then the Imam (AS) continued, As for His Word: Say: The Angels of Death who is given charges of you takes your souls, then to your Lord you shall be brought back, and His Word: Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and also His Word: Our messengers (angels) take his soul away, and they are not remiss, and also His Word: Those whom the angels take away their souls while they are unjust to themselves. And His Word: “those whom the angels take away their souls in a good state, that Peace be on you.” Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, directs all affairs as He wills and He assigns from His Creation whoever He wills and whatever He Wills. As for the Angels of Death, verily, Allah assigns him specifically whoever He will from His Creation and he assigns His Messengers from the angels specifically with whoever He wills of His Creation. The angels which Allah, Mighty be His remembrance, has named and assigned them specifically for whoever He wills from His Creation. Verily, He, the Blessed and Exalted, directs the affairs however He pleases. Not all knowledge makes capable a learned person of explaining to all the people, because there are strong and weak (in understanding) among them. Also, because of them are those who have the strength to bear it and of them are ones who cannot bear it, except for whoever Allah eases the bearing and helps him over it from His beloved ones specifically. Verily, it suffices you to know that Allah is the Reviver and the One who makes to dies. And verily He it is that takes the souls away through whoever He wills of His Creation from the His angels and other than angels. The man said: “You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah comfort you! And may Allah benefit all the Muslims by you!” `Ali (AS) said to the man, “If Allah has expanded your chest for you with what I have explained for you then you are, by the Splitter of Grain Seed and the Maker of Humanity, from the true Believers.” The man asked, “O Commander of Faithful, how is it possible for me to find out that I am of the true Believers?” He (AS) replied: No one knows that except for he who Allah has taught him with the tongue of His Prophet (sw), and the Messenger of Allah (sw) has bore witness for him with Paradise. Or he who Allah has expanded his chest to know what is in the Books which Allah, the Mighty and High, has revealed over His Messengers and Prophets. The man enquired, “O Commander of the Faithful, who has the strength for that?” He (AS) explained, “Whoever Allah expands his chest and directs him to Himself. It is up to you to serve Allah openly and secretly, for nothing equals worship.” The Compiler of this book says: The proof that the Producer is One and not more than that is that if there were two then the matter is not free from being one of the two; that each one of them is All-Powerful over prohibiting his associate form whatever He intends, or that they are not All-Powerful. If it is so then it is possible for both of them to be prevented, and whatever can be prevented has been brought into being. If they are not All-Powerful, they are incapable and deficient, and only things with beginnings can be as such. Therefore, it is correct that he One without Beginning One. The second proof is that each one of them is not powerful enough to hide from the other. Hence, if it is so, the one from whom one can hide, has a beginning. If he is not All-Powerful then he is incapable, and anything which is incapable has beginning as we have already explained earlier. This statement can be used to nullify the concept of two eternal beings. What Mani and Ibn Daysan have professed is nothing but their own superstition. The same nonsense which the Zoroastrians [majus] have professed regarding the Devil [Ahriman] is equally invalid according to this argument. This argument also applies to them. Thus, I have shortened my statement about both of them and did not individually deal with what they asked him (AS).",

(٧) وقال: ﴿يوم القيمة يكفر بعضكم ببعض ويلعن بعضكم بعضا﴾ (٨) وقال: ﴿إن ذلك لحق تخاصم أهل النار﴾ (٩) وقال: ﴿لا تختصموا لدي وقد قدمت إليكم بالوعيد﴾  وقال: (نختم على أفواههم وتكلمنا أيديهم وتشهد أرجلهم بما كانوا يكسبون) (١) فمرة يخبر أنهم يتكلمون ومرة يخبر أنهم لا يتكلمون إلا من أذن له الرحمن وقال صوابا، ومرة يخبر أن الخلق لا ينطقون ويقول عن مقالتهم (والله ربنا ما كنا مشركين) ومرة يخبر أنهم يختصمون، فأني ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال: هات ويحك ما شككت فيه، قال: وأجد الله عز وجل يقول: ﴿وجوه يومئذ ناضرة * إلى ربها ناظرة﴾ ﴿٢) ويقول: لا تدركه الأبصار وهو يدرك الأبصار وهو اللطيف الخبير﴾ (٣) ويقول: ﴿ولقد رآه نزلة أخرى * عند سدرة المنتهى﴾ (٤) ويقول: ﴿يومئذ لا تنفع الشفاعة إلا من أذن له الرحمن ورضي له قولا * يعلم ما بين أيديهم وما خلفهم ولا يحيطون به علما﴾ (٥) ومن أدركه الأبصار فقد أحاط به العلم، فأني ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال: هات أيضا ويحك ما شككت فيه، قال: وأجد الله تبارك وتعالى يقول: ﴿وما كان لبشر أن يكلمه الله إلا وحيا أو من وراء حجاب أو يرسل رسولا فيوحي بإذنه ما يشاء﴾ (٦) وقال: ﴿وكلم الله موسى تكليما﴾ (٧) وقال: ﴿وناداهما ربهما﴾ (٨) وقال: ﴿يا أيها النبي قل لأزواجك وبناتك﴾ (٩) وقال: (﴿يا أيها الرسول بلغ ما أنزل إليك من ربك﴾ (١٠) فأني ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال: هات ويحك ما شككت فيه، قال: وأجد الله جل ثناؤ�� يقول: ﴿هل تعلم له سميا﴾  وقد يسمي الإنسان سميعا بصيرا وملكا وربا، فمرة يخبر بأن له أسامي كثيرة مشتركة، ومرة يقول: (هل تعلم له سميا) فأني ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال: هات ويحك ما شككت فيه، قال: وجدت الله تبارك وتعالى يقول: ﴿وما يعزب عن ربك من مثقال ذرة في الأرض ولا في السماء﴾ (١). ويقول: ﴿ولا ينظر إليهم يوم القيمة ولا يزكيهم﴾ (٢). ويقول: ﴿كلا إنهم عن ربهم يومئذ لمحجوبون﴾ (٣). كيف ينظر إليهم من يحجب عنهم (٤) وأنى ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال: هات أيضا ويحك ما شككت فيه، قال: وأجد الله عز وجل يقول: ﴿أأمنتم من في السماء أن يخسف بكم الأرض فإذا هي تمور﴾ (٥) وقال: ﴿الرحمن على العرش استوى﴾ (٦) وقال: ﴿وهو الله في السماوات وفي الأرض يعلم سركم وجهركم﴾ (٧) وقال: ﴿والظاهر والباطن)﴾ (٨) وقال: ﴿وهو معكم أين ما كنتم﴾ (٩) وقال: ﴿ونحن أقرب إليه من حبل الوريد﴾ (١٠) فأنى ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال هات أيضا ويحك ما شككت فيه، قال: وأجد الله جل ثناؤه يقول: ﴿وجاء ربك والملك صفا صفا﴾ (١١) وقال: ﴿ولقد جئتمونا فرادى كما خلقنا كم أول مرة﴾ (١٢) وقال: ﴿هل ينظرون إلا أن يأتيهم الله في ظلل من الغمام والملائكة﴾  وقال: هل ينظرون إلا أن تأتيهم الملائكة أو يأتي ربك بعض آيات ربك يوم يأتي بعض آيات ربك لا ينفع نفسا إيمانها لم تكن آمنت من قبل أو كسبت في إيمانها خيرا) (١) فمرة يقول: يوم (يأتي ربك) ومرة يقول (يوم يأتي بعض آيات ربك) فأنى ذلك أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال: هات ويحك ما شككت فيه، قال: وأجد الله جل جلاله يقول: ﴿بل هم بلقاء ربهم كافرون﴾ (٢) وذكر المؤمنين فقال: ﴿الذين يظنون أنهم ملاقوا ربهم و أنهم إليه راجعون﴾ (٣) وقال: ﴿تحيتهم يوم يلقونه سلام﴾ (٤) وقال: ﴿من كان يرجوا لقاء الله فإن أجل الله لآت﴾ (٥) وقال: ﴿فمن كان يرجوا لقاء ربه فليعمل عملا صالحا﴾ (٦) فمرة يخبر أنهم يلقونه، ومرة أنه لا تدركه الأبصار وهو يدرك الأبصار، ومرة يقول: (ولا يحيطون بع علما) فأنى ذلك أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال: هات ويحك ما شككت فيه، قال: وأجد الله تبارك وتعالى يقول: ﴿ورأى المجرمون النار فظنوا أنهم مواقعوها﴾ (٧). وقال: ﴿يومئذ يوفيهم الله دينهم الحق ويعلمون أن الله هو الحق المبين﴾ (٨) وقال: ﴿وتظنون بالله الظنونا﴾ (٩) فمرة يخبر أنهم يظنون ومرة يخبر أنهم يعلمون، والظن شك فأنى ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال: هات ما شككت فيه قال: وأجد الله تعالى يقول: ﴿ونضع الموازين القسط ليوم القيمة فلا تظلم نفس شيئا﴾ (١٠) وقال: ﴿فلا نقيم لهم يوم القيمة وزنا﴾  وقال: (فأولئك يدخلون الجنة يرزقون فيها بغير حساب)  وقال: (والوزن يومئذ الحق فمن ثقلت موازينه فأولئك هم المفلحون * ومن خفت موازينه فأولئك الذين خسروا أنفسهم بما كانوا بآياتنا يظلمون) (١) فأنى ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع. قال: هات ويحك ما شككت فيه، قال: وأجد الله تعالى يقول: ﴿قل يتوفاكم ملك الموت الذي وكل بكم ثم إلى ربكم ترجعون﴾ (٢) وقال: ﴿الله يتوفى الأنفس حين موتها﴾ (٣) وقال: ﴿توفته رسلنا وهم لا يفرطون﴾ (٤) وقال: ﴿الذين تتوفاهم الملائكة طيبين﴾ (٥) وقال: ﴿الذين تتوفاهم الملائكة ظالمي أنفسهم﴾  فأنى ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين وكيف لا أشك فيما تسمع، وقد هلكت إن لم ترحمني وتشرح لي صدري فيما عسى أن يجري ذلك على يديك، فإن كان الرب تبارك وتعالى حقا والكتاب حقا والرسل حقا فقد هلكت وخسرت، وإن تكن الرسل باطلا فما علي بأس وقد نجوت. فقال علي عليه السلام: قدوس ربنا قدوس تبارك وتعالى علوا كبيرا، نشهد أنه هو الدائم الذي لا يزول، ولا نشك فيه، وليس كمثله شئ وهو السميع البصير، وأن الكتاب حق والرسل حق، وأن الثواب والعقاب حق، فإن رزقت زيادة إيمان أو حرمته فإن ذلك بيد الله، إن شاء رزقك وإن شاء حرمك ذلك، ولكن سأعلمك ما شككت فيه، ولا قوة إلا بالله، فإن أراد الله بك خيرا أعلمك بعلمه و ثبتك، وإن يكن شرا ضللت وهلكت. أما قوله: (نسوا الله فنسيهم) إنما يعني نسوا الله في دار الدنيا، لم يعلموا بطاعته فنسيهم في الآخرة أي لم يجعل لهم في ثوابه شيئا فصاروا منسسيين من الخير وكذلك تفسير قوله عز وجل: (فاليوم ننسيهم كما نسوا لقاء يومهم هذا) يعني بالنسيان أنه لم يثبهم كما يثيب أولياءه الذين كانوا في دار الدنيا مطيعين ذاكرين حين آمنوا به وبرسله وخافوه بالغيب، وأما قوله: (وما كان ربك نسيا) فإن ربنا تبارك وتعالى علوا كبيرا ليس بالذي ينسى ولا يغفل بل هو الحفيظ العليم، وقد يقول العرب في باب النسيان: قد نسينا فلان فلا يذكرنا أي أنه لا يأمر لنا بخير ولا يذكرنا به، فهل فهمت ما ذكر الله عز وجل، قال: نعم، فرجت عني فرج الله عنك وحللت عني عقدة فعظم الله أجرك. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله: (يوم يقوم الروح والملائكة صفا لا يتكلمون إلا من أذن له الرحمن وقال صوابا) وقوله: (والله ربنا ما كنا مشركين) وقوله: (يوم القيمة يكفر بعضكم ببعض ويلعن بعضكم بعضا) وقوله: (إن ذلك لحق تخاصم أهل النار) وقوله: (لا تختصموا لدي وقد قدمت إليكم بالوعيد) وقوله: (اليوم نختم على أفواههم وتكلمنا أيديهم وتشهد أرجلهم بما كانوا يكسبون) فإن ذلك في مواطن غير واحد من مواطن ذلك اليوم الذي كان مقداره خمسين ألف سنة، يجمع الله عز وجل الخلائق يومئذ في مواطن يتفرقون، ويكلم بعضهم بعضا ويستغفر بعضهم لبعض أولئك الذين كان منهم الطاعة في دار الدنيا للرؤساء والاتباع (١) ويلعن أهل المعاصي الذين بدت منهم البغضاء وتعاونوا على الظلم والعدوان في دار الدنيا، المستكبرين والمستضعفين يكفر بعضهم ببعض ويلعن بعضهم بعضا (٢) والكفر في هذه الآية البراءة، يقول: يبرء بعضهم من بعض، ونظيرها في سورة إبراهيم قول الشيطان (إني كفرت بما أشركتمون من قبل) (٣) وقول إبراهيم خليل الرحمن: ﴿كفرنا بكم﴾  يعني تبرأنا منكم، ثم يجتمعون في موطن آخر يبكون فيه فلو أن تلك الأصوات بدت لأهل الدنيا لأذهلت جميع الخلق عن معائشهم، ولتصدعت قلوبهم إلا ما شاء الله، فلا يزالون يبكون الدم، ثم يجتمعون في موطن آخر فيستنطقون فيه فيقولون: (والله ربنا ما كنا مشركين) فيختم الله تبارك وتعالى على أفواههم و يستنطق الأيدي والأرجل والجلود فتشهد بكل معصية كانت منهم، ثم يرفع عن ألسنتهم الختم فيقولون لجلودهم: ﴿لم شهدتم علينا قالوا أنطقنا الله الذي أنطق كل شئ﴾ (١) ثم يجتمعون في موطن آخر فيستنطقون فيفر بعضهم من بعض، فذلك قوله عز وجل: ﴿يوم يفر المرء من أخيه * وأمه وأبيه * وصاحبته وبنيه﴾ (٢) فيستنطقون فلا يتكلمون إلا ن أذن له الرحمن وقال صوابا، فيقوم الرسل صلى الله عليهم فيشهدون في هذا الموطن فذلك قوله ﴿فكيف إذا جئنا من كل أمة بشهيد وجئنا بك على هؤلاء شهيدا﴾ (٣) ثم يجتمعون في موطن آخر يكون فيه مقام محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وهو المقام المحمود، فيثني على الله تبارك وتعالى بما لم يثن عليه أحد قبله ثم يثني على الملائكة كلهم فلا يبقى ملك إلا أثنى عليه محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم، ثم يثني على الرسل بما لم يثن عليهم أحد قبله، ثم يثني على كل مؤمن ومؤمنة يبدء بالصديقين والشهداء ثم بالصالحين، فيحمده أهل السماوات والأرض، فذلك قوله: ﴿عسى أن يبعثك ربك مقاما محمودا﴾  فطوبى لمن كان له في ذلك المقام حظ، وويل لمن لم يكن له في ذلك المقام حظ ولا نصيب، ثم يجتمعون في موطن آخر ويدال بعضهم من بعض  وهذا كله قبل الحساب، فإذا أخذ في الحساب شغل كل إنسان بما لديه، نسأل الله بركة ذلك اليوم، قال: فرجت عني فرج الله عنك يا أمير المؤمنين، وحللت عني عقدة فعظم الله أجرك. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله عز وجل: (وجوه يومئذ ناضرة إلى ربها ناظرة) وقوله: (لا تدركه الأبصار وهو يدرك الأبصار) وقوله: (ولقد رآه نزلة أخرى عند سدرة المنتهى) وقوله (يومئذ لا تنفع الشفاعة إلا من أذن له الرحمن ورضي له قولا يعلم ما بين أيديهم وما خلفهم ولا يحيطون به علما) فأما قوله: (وجوه يومئذ ناضرة إلى ربها ناظرة) فإن ذلك في موضع ينتهي فيه أولياء الله عز وجل بعد ما يفرغ من الحساب إلى نهر يسمى الحيوان فيغتسلون فيه ويشربون منه فتنضر وجوههم إشراقا (١) فيذهب عنهم كل قذى ووعث، ثم يؤمرون بدخول الجنة، فمن هذا المقام ينظرون إلى ربهم كيف يثيبهم، ومنه يدخلون الجنة، فذلك قوله عز وجل من تسليم الملائكة عليهم: ﴿سلام عليكم طبتم فادخلوها خالدين﴾ (٢) فعند ذلك أيقنوا بدخول الجنة والنظر إلى ما وعدهم ربهم فذلك قوله: (إلى ربها ناظرة) وإنما بالنظر إليه النظر إلى ثوابه تبارك وتعالى. وأما قوله: (لا تدركه الأبصار وهو يدرك الأبصار) فهو كما قال: (لا تدركه الأبصار) يعني لا تحيط به الأوهام (وهو يدرك الأبصار) يعني يحيط بها وهو اللطيف الخبير، وذلك مدح امتدح به ربنا نفسه تبارك وتعالى وتقدس علوا كبيرا، وقد سأل موسى عليه السلام وجرى على لسانه من حمد الله عز وجل ﴿رب أرني أنظر إليك﴾  فكانت مسألته تلك أمرا عظيما وسأل أمرا جسيما فعوقب، فقال الله تبارك وتعالى: لن تراني في الدنيا حتى تموت فتراني في الآخرة  ولكن إن أردت أن تراني في الدنيا فانظر (إلى الجبل فإن استقر مكانه فسوف تراني) فأبدى الله سبحان بعض آياته وتجلى ربنا للجبل فتقطع الجبل فصار رميما وخر موسى صعقا، يعني ميتا فكان عقوبته الموت  ثم أحياه الله وبعثه وتاب عليه، فقال: (سبحانك تبت إليك وأنا أول المؤمنين) يعني أول مؤمن آمن بك منهم أنه لن يراك، وأما قوله: (ولقد رآه نزلة أخرى عند سدره المنتهى) يعني محمدا صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم كان عند سدرة المنتهى حيث لا يتجاوزها خلق من خلق الله  وقوله في آخر الآية: (ما زاغ البصر وما طغى لقد رأى من آيات ربه الكبرى) رأى جبرئيل عليه السلام في صورته مرتين هذه المرة ومرة أخرى  وذلك أن خلق جبرئيل عظيم فهو من الروحانيين الذين لا يدرك خلقهم وصفتهم إلا الله رب العالمين . وأما قوله: (يومئذ لا تنفع الشفاعة إلا من أذن له الرحمن ورضي له قولا يعلم ما بين أيديهم وما خلفهم ولا يحيطون به علما) لا يحيط الخلائق بالله عز وجل علما إذ هو تبارك وتعالى جعل على أبصار القلوب الغطاء، فلا فهم يناله بالكيف، ولا قلب يثبته بالحدود، فلا يصفه إلا كما وصف نفسه ليس كمثله شئ وهو السميع البصير، الأول والآخر والظاهر والباطن، الخالق البارئ المصور، خلق الأشياء فليس من الأشياء شئ مثله تبارك وتعالى، فقال: فرجت عني فرج الله عنك، وحللت عني عقدة فأعظم الله أجرك يا أمير المؤمنين. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله: (وما كان لبشر أن يكلمه إلا وحيا أو من وراء حجاب أو يرسل رسولا فيوحي بإذنه ما يشاء) وقوله: (وكلم الله موسى تكليما) و قوله: ((وناداهما ربهما) وقوله: (يا آدم اسكن أنت وزوجك الجنة) فأما قوله (ما كان لبشر أن يكلمه الله إلا وحيا أو من وراء حجاب) فإنه ما ينبغي لبشر أن يكلمه الله إلا وحيا وليس بكائن إلا من وراء حجاب، أو يرسل رسولا فيوحي بإذنه ما يشاء، كذلك قال الله تبارك وتعالى علوا كبيرا، قد كان الرسول يوحى إليه من رسل السماء فيبلغ رسل السماء رسل الأرض، وقد كان الكلام بين رسل أهل الأرض وبينه من غير أن يرسل بالكلام مع رسل أهل السماء، وقد قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم: يا جبرئيل هل رأيت ربك  فقال جبرئيل: إن ربي لا يرى، فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم: فمن أين تأخذ الوحي؟ فقال: آخذه من إسرافيل فقال: ومن أين يأخذه إسرافيل؟ قال: يأخذه من ملك فوقه من الروحانيين، قال: فمن أين يأخذه ذلك الملك؟ قال: يقذف في قلبه قذفا، فهذا وحي، وهو كلام الله عز وجل، وكلام الله ليس بنحو واحد، منه ما كلم الله به الرسل، ومنه ما قذفه في قلوبهم، ومنه رؤيا يريها الرسل، ومنه وحي وتنزيل يتلى ويقرأ، فهو كلام الله، فاكتف بما وصفت لك من كلام الله، فإن معنى كلام الله ليس بنحو واحد فإن منه ما يبلغ به رسل السماء رسل الأرض، قال: فرجت عني فرج الله عنك و حللت عني عقدة فعظم الله أجرك يا أمير المؤمنين. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله: (هل تعلم له سميا) فإن تأويله هل تعلم أحدا اسمه الله غير الله تبارك وتعالى، فإياك أن تفسر القرآن برأيك حتى تفقهه عن العلماء، فإنه رب تنزيل يشبه كلام البشر وهو كلام الله، وتأويله لا يشبه كلام - البشر، كما ليس شئ من خلقه يشبهه، كذلك لا يشبه فعله تبارك وتعالى شيئا من أفعال البشر، ولا يشبه شئ من كلامه كلام البشر، فكلام الله تبارك وتعالى صفته  وكلام البشر أفعالهم، فلا تشبه كلام الله بكلام البشر فتهلك وتضل، قال: فرجت عني فرج الله عنك، وحللت عني عقدة فعظم الله أجرك يا أمير المؤمنين. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله: (وما يعزب عن ربك من مثقال ذره في الأرض ولا في السماء، كذلك ربنا لا يعزب عنه شئ، وكيف يكون من خلق الأشياء لا يعلم ما خلق وهو الخلاق العليم. وأما قوله: (لا ينظر إليهم يوم القيمة) يخبر أنه لا يصيبهم بخير، وقد تقول العرب: والله ما ينظر إلينا فلان، وإنما يعنون بذلك أنه لا يصيبنا منه بخير، فذلك النظر ههنا من الله تعالى إلى خلقه، فنظره إليهم رحمة منه لهم، وأما قوله: (كلا إنهم عن ربهم يومئذ لمحجوبون) فإنما يعني بذلك يوم القيامة أنهم عن ثواب ربهم محجوبون قال: فرجت عني فرج الله عنك، وحللت عني عقدة فعظم الله أجرك. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله: (أأمنتم من في السماء أن يخسف بكم الأرض فإذا هي تمور) وقوله: (وهو الله في السماوات وفي الأرض) وقوله: (الرحمن على العرش استوى) وقوله: (وهو معكم أينما كنتم) وقوله: (ونحن أقرب إليه من حبل الوريد) فكذلك الله تبارك وتعالى سبوحا قدوسا، تعالى أن يجري منه ما يجري من المخلوقين وهو اللطيف الخبير، وأجل وأكبر أن ينزل به شئ مما ينزل بخلقه وهو على العرش استوى علمه، شاهد لكل نجوى، وهو الوكيل على كل شئ، والميسر لكل شئ، والمدبر للأشياء كلها، تعالى الله عن أن يكون على عرشه علوا كبيرا. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله: (وجاء ربك والملك صفا صفا) وقوله: (ولقد جئتمونا فرادى كما خلقناكم أول مرة)، قوله: (هل ينظرون إلا أن يأتيهم الله في ظلل من الغمام والملائكة) وقوله: (هل ينظرون إلا أن تأتيهم الملائكة أو يأتي ربك أو يأتي بعض آيات ربك) فإن ذلك حق كما قال الله عز وجل، و ليس له جيئة كجيئة الخلق، وقد أعلمتك أن رب شئ من كتاب الله تأويله على غير تنزيله ولا يشبه كلام البشر، وسأنبئك بطرف منه فتكتفي إن شاء الله، من ذلك قول إبراهيم عليه السلام: ﴿إني ذاهب إلى ربي سيهدين﴾ (١) فذهابه إلى ربه توجهه إليه عبادة واجتهادا وقربة إلى الله عز وجل، ألا ترى أن تأويله غير تنزيله، وقال ﴿وأنزلنا الحديد فيه بأس شديد﴾ (٢) يعني السلاح وغير ذلك، وقوله: (هل ينظرون إلا أن تأتيهم الملائكة) يخبر محمدا (٣) صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم عن المشركين والمنافقين الذين لم يستجيبوا لله وللرسول، فقال: (هل ينظرون إلا أن تأتيهم الملائكة) حيث لم يستجيبوا لله ولرسوله (أو يأتي ربك أو يأتي بعض آيات ربك) يعني بذلك العذاب يأتيهم في دار الدنيا كما عذب القرون الأولى، فهذا خبر يخبر به النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم عنهم، ثم قال: (يوم يأتي بعض آيات ربك لا ينفع نفسا إيمانها لم تكن آمنت من قبل أو كسبت في إيمانها خيرا) يعني من قبل أن يجيئ هذه الآية، وهذه الآية طلوع الشمس من مغربها، وإنما يكتفي أولوا الألباب والحجى وأولوا النهى أن يعلموا أنه إذا انكشف الغطاء رأوا ما يوعدون، وقال: في آية أخرى: ﴿فأتاهم الله من حيث لم يحتسبوا﴾ (٤) يعني أرسل عليهم عذابا، وكذلك إتيانه بنيانهم قال الله عز وجل: ﴿فأتى الله بنيانهم من القواعد﴾  فإتيانه بنيانهم من القواعد إرسال العذاب عليهم، وكذلك ما وصف من أمر الآخرة تبارك اسمه وتعالى علوا كبيرا أنه يجري أموره في ذلك اليوم الذي كان مقداره خمسين ألف سنة كما يجري أموره في الدنيا لا يغيب  ولا يأفل مع الآفلين، فاكتف بما وصفت لك من ذلك مما جال في صدرك مما وصف الله عز وجل في كتابه، ولا تجعل كلامه ككلام البشر، هو أعظم وأجل وأكرم وأعز تبارك وتعالى من أن يصفه الواصفون إلا بما وصف به نفسه في قوله عز وجل: ﴿ليس كمثله شئ وهو السميع البصير﴾ (١) قال: فرجت عني يا أمير المؤمنين فرج الله عنك، وحللت عني عقدة. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله: (بل هم بلقاء ربهم كافرون) وذكر الله المؤمنين (الذين يظنون أنهم ملاقوا ربهم)) وقوله لغيرهم: ﴿إلى يوم يلقونه بما أخلفوا الله ما وعدوه﴾  وقوله: (فمن كان يرجوا لقاء ربه فليعمل عملا صالحا) فأما قوله: (بل هم بلقاء ربهم كافرون) يعني البعث فسماه الله عز وجل لقاءه، وكذلك ذكر المؤمنين (الذين يظنون أنهم ملاقوا ربهم) يعني يوقنون أنهم يبعثون و يحشرون ويحاسبون ويجزون بالثواب والعقاب، فالظن ههنا اليقين خاصة، و كذلك قوله: (فمن كان يرجوا لقاء ربه فليعمل عملا صالحا) وقوله: (من كان يرجوا لقاء الله فإن أجل الله لآت) يعني: من كان يؤمن بأنه مبعوث فإن وعد الله لآت من الثواب والعقاب، فاللقاء ههنا ليس بالرؤية، واللقاء هو البعث، فافهم جميع ما في الكتاب من لقائه فإنه يعني بذلك البعث، وكذلك قوله: (تحيتهم يوم يلقونه سلام) يعني أنه لا يزول الإيمان عن قلوبهم يوم يبعثون، قال: فرجت عني يا أمير المؤمنين فرج الله عنك، فقد حللت عني عقدة. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله: (ورأى المجرمون النار فظنوا أنهم مواقعوها) يعني أيقنوا أنهم داخلوها، وكذلك قوله: (إني ظننت أني ملاق حسابيه) يقول إني أيقنت أني أبعث فأحاسب، وكذلك قوله: (يومئذ يوفيهم الله دينهم الحق ويعلمون أن الله هو الحق المبين) وأما قوله للمنافقين: (وتظنون بالله الظنونا) فهذا الظن ظن شك وليس ظن يقين، والظن ظنان: ظن شك وظن يقين، فما كان من أمر معاد من الظن فهو ظن يقين، وما كان من أمر الدنيا فهو ظن شك فافهم ما فسرت لك، قال: فرجت عني يا أمير المؤمنين فرج الله عنك. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله تبارك وتعالى: (ونضع الموازين القسط ليوم القيمة فلا تظلم نفس شيئا) فهو ميزان العدل يؤخذ به الخلائق يوم القيامة، يدين الله تبارك و تعالى الخلق بعضهم من بعض بالموازين. وفي غير هذا الحديث الموازين هم الأنبياء والأوصياء عليهم السلام . وأما قوله عز وجل: (فلا نقيم لهم يوم القيمة وزنا) فإن ذلك خاصه. وأما قوله: (فأولئك يدخلون الجنة يرزقون فيها بغير حساب) فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم قال: قال الله عز وجل: لقد حقت كرامتي - أو قال: مودتي - لمن يراقبني ويتحاب بجلالي  إن وجوههم يوم القيامة من نور على منابر من نور عليهم ثياب خضر، قيل: من هم يا رسول الله؟ قال: قوم ليسوا بأنبياء ولا شهداء، ولكنهم تحابوا بجلال الله ويدخلون الجنة بغير حساب، نسأل الله عز وجل أن يجعلنا منهم برحمته. وأما قوله: فمن ثقلت موازينه وخفت موازينه فإنما يعني الحساب، توزن الحسنات والسيئات، والحسنات ثقل الميزان والسيئات خفة الميزان. فقال عليه السلام: وأما قوله: (قل يتوفاكم ملك الموت الذي وكل بكم ثم إلى ربكم ترجعون) وقوله: (الله يتوفى الأنفس حين موتها) وقوله: (توفته رسلنا وهم لا يفرطون) وقوله: (الذين تتوفاهم الملائكة ظالمي أنفسهم) وقوله: تتوفاهم الملائكة طيبين يقولون سلام عليكم) فإن الله تبارك وتعالى يدبر الأمور كيف يشاء، ويوكل من خلقه من يشاء بما يشاء. أما ملك الموت فإن الله يوكله بخاصة من يشاء من خلقه، ويوكل رسله من الملائكة خاصة بمن يشاء من خلقه، والملائكة الذين سماهم الله عز ذكره وكلهم بخاصة من يشاء من خلقه، إنه تبارك وتعالى يدبر الأمور كيف يشاء، وليس كل العلم يستطيع صاحب العلم أن يفسره لكل الناس لأن منهم القوي والضعيف، ولأن منه ما يطاق حمله ومنه ما لا يطاق حمله إلا من يسهل الله له حمله وأعانه عليه من خاصة أوليائه، وإنما يكفيك أن تعلم أن الله هو المحيي المميت وأنه يتوفى الأنفس على يدي من يشاء من خلقه من ملائكته وغيرهم، قال: فرجت عني فرج الله عنك يا أمير المؤمنين ونفع الله المسلمين بك . فقال علي عليه السلام للرجل: إن كنت قد شرح الله صدرك بما قد تبينت لك فأنت والذي فلق الحبة وبرأ النسمة من المؤمنين حقا، فقال الرجل: يا أمير المؤمنين كيف لي أن أعلم بأني من المؤمنين حقا؟ قال عليه السلام: لا يعلم ذلك إلا من أعلمه الله على لسان نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله وشهد له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بالجنة أو شرح الله صدره ليعلم ما في الكتب التي أنزلها الله عز وجل على رسله وأنبيائه، قال: يا أمير المؤمنين ومن يطيق ذلك؟ قال: من شرح الله صدره ووفقه له، فعليك بالعمل لله في سر أمرك وعلانيتك فلا شئ يعدل العمل. قال مصنف هذا الكتاب: الدليل على أن الصانع واحد لا أكثر من ذلك أنهما لو كانا اثنين لم يخل الأمر فيهما من أن يكون كل واحد منهما قادرا على منع صاحبه مما يريد أو غير قادر، فإن كان كذلك فقد جاز عليهما المنع ومن جاز عليه ذلك فمحدث كما أن المصنوع محدث، وإن لم يكونا قادرين لزمهما العجز و النقص وهما من دلالات الحدث، فصح أن القديم واحد. ودليل آخر وهو أن كل واحد منهما لا يخلوا من أن يكون قادرا على أن يكتم الآخر شيئا، فإن كان كذلك فالذي جاز الكتمان عليه حادث، وإن لم يكن قادرا فهو عاجز والعاجز حادث لما بيناه، وهذا الكلام يحتج به في إبطال قديمين صفة كل واحد منهما صفة القديم الذي أثبتناه، فأما ما ذهب إليه ماني وابن ديصان من خرافاتهما في الامتزاج ودانت به المجوس من حماقاتها في أهرمن ففاسد بما يفسد به قدم الأجسام، ولدخولهما في تلك الجملة اقتصرت على هذا الكلام فيهما ولم أفرد كلا منهما بما يسأل عنه منه.

    "thaqalaynSanad": "5. Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan said: Ahmad ibn Yahya said, on the authority of Bakr ibn `Abd Allah ibn Hubayb that Ahmad ibn Ya`qub ibn Matar related to me that Muhammad ibn alHasan bin `Abd al-`Aziz al-Ahdab al-Jund said in Naysabur that I found in my father’s book in his writing: Talhah ibn Yazid said, on the authority of `Ubayd Allah ibn `Ubayd, on the authority of Abu Ma`mar al-Sa`dani that ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "A man came to the Commander of the Faithful `Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) and said: “O Commander of the Faithful! Verily, I have doubted the Revealed Book of Allah.” The Imam (AS) replied to him, “May your mother be bereaved of you! How did you come to doubt the Revealed Book of Allah?” He said: “Because I find some parts of the Book belie some other parts then how should I not doubt in it.?” Consequently, `Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) replied, “Verily, when it comes to the Book of Allah, some parts of it verify other parts. However, you have not been given the sustenance of wisdom to benefit form it. Bring me what you doubt in the Book of Allah, the Mighty and High.” The man explained to him (AS), “I found Allah saying that So today We forget them, as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, also: They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them, and said: And your Lord is not forgetful. Thus, once He informs that He does forget and in another place He says that He does not forget. O Commander of the Faithful, what is that?” Imam `Ali (AS) said: “Bring me what you doubt in.” He said: I have found Allah saying that The Day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks; they shall not speak except he whom the Most Compassionate God permits and who speaks the right thing, He says: (they will speak) They would say: By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheist, He says: On the Resurrection Day some of you shall deny others, and some of you shall curse others, then He says: That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the fire, He says: Do not quarrel in My Presence, and indeed I gave you the threatening beforehand, and He says: We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what t hey earned. Therefore, on one occasion He says that they will speak, and on another occasion He says: “they will not speak except he whom the Most Compassionate permits and who speaks the right thing.” In one place He informs that the creation will not speak and describes their statement: “By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheist.” In another place He says that they will quarrel. O Commander of the Faithful, why is that? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear (from me)? The Imam said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” He responded, I also find Allah, the Mighty and High saying that Faces on that day shall be bright, looking to their Lord, and he says: Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends (all) vision; and He is the Knower of Subtleties, the Aware, He says: And certainly he saw him in another descent, a the farthest lotus-tree; He also says: On that day shall no intercession avail except of him whom the Beneficent Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do not comprehend it in knowledge. Whoever the eyes have perceived is encompassed in knowledge. O Commander of Faithful, why is that? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man uttered, I also find Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, that And it is not for any man that Allah should speak to him save by revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger (angel) and to reveal by His permission what He wills, He also says: And to Musa, Allah addressed His Word, speaking (to him), and He says: And their Lord called out to them, and He says, O Prophet! Say to your wives and your daughters and He also says: O Messenger! Deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord. Why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man further said: I find Allah, High be His Praise, saying that Do you know anyone else named with the same names? He names the human as hearing [sami`], seeing [basir`], sovereign [malik], lord [rabb]. Therefore, at times He says that He has many common names, and at other times He says: “do you know anyone else named with the same name?” Why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And ho shall I not doubt in what you hear?” The Imam said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” He said: I found Allah, the Blessed and Exalted saying, that And there does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an atom in the earth or in heaven, and that nor will He look upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them, and also that Nay! Most surely they shall on that day be veiled from their Lord. How does He look at them when they are veiled? And why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) replied, “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” He continued, And I find Allah, the Might and High, saying that Are you secure of those in heaven and He should not make the earth to swallow you up, and that The Most Compassionate Allah is firm on the Empyrean, and also that And He is Allah in heavens and in the earth; He knows your secrets and your disclosures, and that The Manifested and the Hidden, and that He is with you wherever you may be, and also that We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And ho shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) said: “Woe unto you! Bring me more what you doubt in.” The man further said: I find Allah, High be His praise, saying that And your Lord comes and (also) the angels in ranks, and he said: Verily, you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and said: They do not wait aught but that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds along with the angels, and also said: They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come. On the day when some of the Signs of your Lord shall come, its faith shall not profit a soul which did no believe before, or earn good through its faith. Thus, in one place He says: “On the Day your Lord should come” and in another place He says: “on the Day some of the Signs of your Lord should come.” Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man continued, And I find Allah, the Mighty and High, saying that Nay! They are unbelievers in the meeting of their Lord, and when He mentioned the Believer, He said: Who know that they shall meet their Lord and that they shall return to Him, and said: Their greetings on the Day when they meet Him shall be: “Peace,” and He also said: Whoever hopes to meet Allah, then meeting Him is forthcoming, and said: Therefore, whoever hope to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds. Thus, in one occasion, He says that they will meet Him, and on other occasion, He says that vision cannot perceive Him, and that He perceives all vision. And at another time He says: “They cannot encompass Him with knowledge.” Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear The Imam (AS) said: “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man said: I found Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, that And the guilty shall see the fire, then they shall think that they are going to fall into it, and He said: On that day Allah will pay back to them in full their just reward, and they shall know that Allah is the evident Truth, and He also said: You began to think diverse thoughts of Allah. So in one place He says that “they think,” and in another place He says that “they know.” Thinking [zann] is doubt. Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you heard? The Imam (AS) said: “Bring me what you doubt in.” The man said: I find Allah, the Exalted, saying that And We will set up a just balance on the Day of Resurrection, so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and He said: Therefore, We will not set up a balance for them on the Day of Resurrection, and He also said: These shall enter the garden, in which they shall be given sustenance without measure, and He also said: And the measuring out on the that day will be just; then as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is heavy, those are they who shall be successful; and as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is light those are they who have made their souls suffer loss because they were unjust towards Our signs. Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? The Imam (AS) replied, “Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.” The man said: I found Allah, the Exalted, saying that Say: The Angel of Death who is given charge of you takes your souls, then to your Lord you shall be brought back, and He said: Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and He also said: Our Messengers (angels) take his soul away, and they are not remiss, and also said: Thos whom the angels take away their souls in a good state, and He also said: Those whom the angels take away their souls while they are unjust to themselves. Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? Thus, I shall perish if you do not have mercy on me, and expand my chest for me in what might happen by my hands. For if the Lord, the Blessed and Exalted is truth, the book is truth, and the Messengers are truth, then I have perished and am in loss. However, if the Messengers are false then it does not matter, and I am saved. Consequently, `Ali (AS) said: Our Lord, the Most Holy, Blessed and Exalted be He, is Elevated, and Great. We bear witness that He is the Ever-Lasting who does not decline. We do not doubt in Him, and there is nothing whatsoever like Him, and He is All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. And we bear witness that the Book is truth, the Messengers are truth, and that the reward of Allah and the wrath of Allah are true. Thus, if you are given faith, or faith is taken away from you, then that is Allah’s prerogative. If He wishes to bless you, He will and if He does not wish to, He will not. Nonetheless, I will clarify the issues in which you doubt. There is no strength or power but Allah. If Allah intends good for you, He will grant you guidance through His Knowledge and keep you firm in faith. However, if He wishes evil for you, then certainly you have gone astray and you have perished. As for His Statement: “They forgot Allah so He has forgotten them,” Verily, that means “they forgot Allah in this world.” Since they do not obey Him in this world, He has forgotten them in the Hereafter. In other words, He will not reward them. As such, they have been excluded from good. Similar is the explanation of His Word, the Mighty and High “So today We forget them, as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs.” What He means by “the forgetting” is that He will not reward them like He rewards His Beloved Ones who were obedient to Him in this world, and who remembered Him by professing faith in Him and in His Messengers, and who feared Him in secret. As for His word: “And you Lord id not forgetful” it means that our Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, the Elevated, and the Great, is not forgetful or neglectful, rather, He is the Protecting, the All-Knowing. The Arabs say about forgetfulness: “So and so has forgotten us,” i.e. he does not wish good for us not does he remember us with goodness. As a result, have you understood what Allah, the Mighty and High, has mentioned? The man replied, “Verily, you have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have resolved my problem. May Allah increase your reward! The Imam (AS) continued, As for His Word: “The Day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks; they shall not speak except he whom the Most Compassionate God permits and who speaks the right thing,” and His Word: “By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists,” and His Word: “On the Resurrection Day some of you shall deny others, and some of you shall curse others,” and His Word: “That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the fire,” and His Word: “Do not quarrel in My Presence, and indeed I gave you the threatening beforehand.” And he says: “We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hand shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned.” Verily, these events take place at different times and at different places on the Day that will last fifty thousand years. Allah, the Mighty and High, will bring forth all the creations that Day in different places. Some will speak to others, and some of whom will seek forgiveness for others. They are the obedient ones, and followers of the (righteous) leaders in this world. The disobedient ones will curse. They are the ones who incited hatred, and engaged in oppression and aggression on worldly abode. The empowered ones and the weak ones will deny each other and curse each other. The denial [kufr] in this verse refers to immunity. He is that “some of them shall grant immunity to others.” It is like the statement of Satan in surah “Abraham: ”Verily, I disbelievers in your associating me with Allah before; and the statement of Ibrahim (AS) the Friend of Allah: We renounce you, i.e. we disassociate ourselves for you. Then they will unite in another place where they will cry. If those screams arise for the people of this world, they would certainly startle all of the creation from their livelihood, and their hearts would crack except what Allah wills. Hence, they shall continue to weep bold. Then they will unite in another place where they will be made to speak and say: “By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists.” Therefore, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands, feet and skins will be made to speak. So they will witness every sin which they did with these parts. Then the seal from their tongues will be raised so they will say to their skins: Why have you borne witness against us? They shall say: Allah who makes everything speak has made us speak. Then they unite in another place and will be made to speak, but they will escape from one another. This is the meaning of the Word of the Mighty and High: The day on which a man shall fly from his brother, and his mother and his father, and his spouse and his son. Thus, they will seek to speak but no one shall speak except for whom the Beneficent permits and who speaks the right thing. At this point the Messengers, blessings of Allah be upon them, shall rise and bear witness, to the Word of Allah: How will it be, then, when We bring from every people a witness and bring you as a witness against these? Then they will meet in another place, where there shall be the place of Muhammad (sw) and that is the Praised Position [almuqam al-mahmud]. Thus, he (sw) will praise Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, the way no one has praised Him before him. Then he (sw) will praise each and every angel. There shall not remain any angel that he will not have praised. Then he will praise the Messengers (AS) in such way that no one has done so before him. The he (sw) will praise every believing man and believing woman starting with the strictly veracious [siddiqin], the martyrs, and the pious ones [salihin]. Then all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth will praise him as we see in the Word of Allah: Maybe your Lord will raise you to a praised position. Hence, blessed are those who have any allotment in that Position, and woe unto those who do not have any allotment or share in that Position. Then they will unite in another place, and some of them will vie the upper hand to others. This is all before the Accountability [al-hisab]. Thus, when one is taken to accountability then everyone shall be occupied with what they have before them. We ask Allah for the blessing of that Day. The man responded, “You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful. May Allah comfort you! You have solved my problem. May Allah increase your reward!” The Imam (AS) then continued, As for the Word of the Mighty and High: “Faces on that day shall be bright, looking to their Lord,” and His Word: “Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends (ALL) vision;” and His Word: “and verily he saw him in another descent, at the farthest lotustree;” and His Word also: “On that day shall not intercession avail except of him whom the Most Compassionate Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do not comprehend it in knowledge.” As for His Word: “Faces on that day shall be bright, looking to their Lord” then Verily, that is a place where the Beloved Ones of Allah, the Mighty and High, end up in after they have finished with the accountability to the river which is named al-Hayawan. They will wash in it and drink from it so their faces will be helped to shine. Hence, every floating impurity and difficulty will vanish from them. Then they will be ordered to enter Paradise. From this position they will look at their Lord, how He rewards them and from there they will enter Paradise. That is the Word of the Mighty and High about the salutation of the angels unto them: Peace be on you, you shall be happy; therefore, enter it to abide. At that point, they will be certain of entering Paradise and looking at what their Lord had promised them. Thus, that is the Word of Allah: “looking to their Lord.” Verily, what is meant by “looking at Him” here is “looking at the reward of the Blessed and Exalted.” As for His Word: “Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends vision” then it is just as He said: “vision comprehends Him not,” i.e. the imaginations cannot encompass him. “He comprehends vision” i.e. He encompasses vision “and He is the Knower of subtleties, the Aware.” That is the praise with which our Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, has eulogized and extolled Himself, the Elevated, the High. Musa (AS) asked and the praise of Allah, the Mighty and High, flowed over his tongue: My Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. Thus, his question was a great matter and he had asked for a body matter and, hence, was inflicted. So Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, said: you will not see me in this world until you die, then you will see Me in the Hereafter. However, if you intend to see me in this world then look at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me; therefore, Allah, glory be Him, expressed some of His signs and our Lord manifested to the mountain, the mountain had crumbled and had become dust and Musa fell down in a swoon; i.e. he had died. Thus, his infliction was the death, and then he was brought back to life by Allah and he recovered, he returned and said: Glory be to Thee, I turn to Thee, and I am the first of the Believers, i.e. the first who believed in You and who never say You. As for His Word: And verily he saw him in another descent, at the farthest lotus-tree; i.e. Muhammad (sw) was at the farthest lotus-tree, as no creation from the creation of Allah crosses that position. And Allah’s Word a the end of the verse: The eye did not turn aside, nor did it exceed the limit, certainly he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord. He (sw) saw Jibra’il (AS) in his true form twice, at this time, and at another time. Jibra’il is enormous. He is one of the holy ones [rawhaniyin] whose creation and description cannot be perceived except by Allah, the Lord of the Universe. As for His Word: On that Day shall no intercession avail except of him whom the Most Compassionate Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do no comprehend it in knowledge. The creations cannot comprehend Allah, the Mighty and High, in knowledge, as He is the Blessed and Exalted. He has placed over the vision of the hearts a veil. Thus, no understanding reaches Him in form. Nor any heat proves Him with limits. Therefore, no one attributes Him except with what He has attributed Himself. There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing, the First, the Last, the Manifest, the Hidden, the Creator, the Maker, the Imager. He created all things; none of the things are like Him, the blessed and Exalted. The man said: “You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward, O Commander of the Faithful! The Imam (AS) then added, As for His Word: And it is not for any man that Allah should speak to him save by revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger (angel) and to reveal by His Permission what He wills, and His Word: And to Musa, Allah addressed His Words, speaking (to him), and also His Word: And their Lord called out to them, and His Word: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the garden! As for His Word: “And it is not for any man that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil” for verily it is a must for humankind that Allah may only speak to him through revelation and that is not possible except from behind a veil, or by sending an angel to reveal by His permission what He wills. That is what Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said, the Elevated and high. The Messenger was revealed unto from the angels of heaven, thus, the angels of heave delivered to the angels of the earth. The speech between the angels of the earth and the Messenger did not happen without their speech with the angels of heaven. Hence, the Messenger of Allah (sw) said: “O Jibra’il, have you seen your Lord?” He replied, `Verily, my Lord cannot be seen.” Consequently, the Messenger of Allah (sw) asked, “Then where do you take the revelation from?” He answered, “I take it from Israfil.” He (sw) enquired, “And where does Israfil take it form?” He replied, “He takes it from another angel above him from the divine ones.” The Messenger (sw) asked, “And where does that angel take it from?” He explained,” It is thrown upon his heart.” This is revelation and that is the word of Allah, the Mighty and High, and the word of Allah is not (revealed) in one method; among them is what Allah spoke to the Messengers, among them is what He threw upon their hearts, among them is what the Messengers see in their dreams, among them is inspiration and revelation which is read and delivered. That is the word of Allah. Thus, I will suffice with what I have described for you of Allah’s speech. Verily, the meaning of Allah’s Word is not one. Among them is certainly what the angels of heaven deliver to the angels of the earth. The man said: “You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward, O Commander of the Faithful!” The Imam (AS) then added, As for His Word: Do you know anyone else named with the same name? Verily, the interpretation of that is “do you know anyone else with the name Allah, other than Allah, the Blessed and Exalted.” Be careful not to explain the Qur’an by your personal views unless you deeply understand it from the learned. For verily, there is revelation many a times resembling the word of man, but it is the word of Allah. So its interpretation does not resemble the word of man, like nothing from His Creation resembles Him. Likewise, none of His Actions, the Blessed and Exalted, resemble the actions of man and his Word does not resemble the word of man. Thus, the Word of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted is His Attribute, and the words of man are their actions. Therefore, do not compare the Word of Allah with the word of man for it you do then you shall perish and go astray. The man responded, “You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solve a problem. May Allah increase your reward, O Commander of the Faithful!” Then the Imam (AS) continued, As for His Word: And there does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an atom in the earth or in heaven, that is how our Lord is, nothing lies concealed from Him and how could it, He who created the things would not know what He created, while He is the Creator, the All-Knowing. And as for His Word: nor will he look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, He is informing that He will not bestow upon them good. The Arabs say: “By Allah, so and so does not look upon us.” Verily, what they mean by it is that “he does not bestow us good.” Thus, that is the “look from Allah, the Exalted, to His Creation here. So His Look upon them is His Mercy for them. And for His Word: Nay! Most surely they shall on that day be veiled from their Lord. Verily, what He means by this is “on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be veiled from the reward of their Lord.” The man responded, “You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward!” The Imam (AS) then said: As for His Word: Are you secure of those in heaven that He should not make the earth to swallow you up? And His Word: And He is Allah in heavens and in the Earth; and His Word: The Most Compassionate Allah is firm on the Empyrean, and also His Word: He is with you wherever you may be, and also His Word: We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. Such is Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, the Most Praised, the Most Holy. Exalted is He from what befalls the creations. He is the Subtle, the All-Informed, and far beyond being compared to His Creation. His Knowledge is firm on the Empyrean. He is the Witness to every whisper. He is the Custodian over Everything, the Creator of Everything, and the Director of Everything. Far Exalted is Allah, Elevated and High, from being on His Empyrean! Thus, the Imam (AS) continued, And as for His Word: And you Lord comes and (also) the angels in ranks, and His Word: Verily, you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and also His Word: They do not wait aught but that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds along with the angels, and also His Word: They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come. Verily, this is all truth as Allah, the Mighty and High has said. He does not have a coming like the coming of the creation. I have already taught you that there is something from the Book of Allah, interpretation of which is other than its revelation and it does not resemble the word of man. I will shortly notify you to one of its dimensions and that should suffice you, if Allah willing. From that is the word of Ibrahim (AS): Surely I am going to my Lord; He will guide me. Therefore, his going to His Lord is attention towards Him in service, effort and closeness to Allah, High and Mighty. Do you not see that its interpretation is other than its revelation? He has also said: We sent down the iron, wherein is latent mighty power, i.e. the weapons etc. They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, He is informing Muhammad (sw) about the infidels and the hypocrites who did not respond to Allah and the Messenger. So He said: They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them. As they did not respond to Allah and His Messenger, “or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come.” What He means by this is that the punishment should come to them in this world like He punished the earlier ages. Thus, this is information about them He is giving to the Prophet (sw). Then He says: On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith. That is, before this sing comes, this sign is rising of the sun from the west; Verily, it would suffice the ones with intellect, brain and understanding to know that if he removes the veil they will see what they have been promised. He has said in another verse: But Allah came to them whence they did not expect, i.e. He sent unto them a punishment. And like is His Coming to their building as Allah, the Mighty and High, has said: Then Allah came (and demolished) their building from the foundations. Thus, His coming to their buildings from their foundations means sending the punishment over them. Similar is what He has described for the affair of the Hereafter, Blessed and Exalted be His Name, Elevated High. Verily, He will set running His affairs in that Day, which is fifty thousand years long, like He set running His affairs in this world. He does not disappear, nor does He pass with the transitory. Thus, I will suffice with what I have described for you from that which is wandering in your mind of what Allah, the Mighty and High has described in His Book. Do not make His Words like the word of humankind. He is Greater, Mightier, More Generous and Higher, Blessed and Exalted from that which the attributers may attribute. Except with what He attributes Himself in His Word, the Mighty and High: There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The man said: “You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah comfort you! You have soled a problem. May Allah increase your reward! The Imam (AS) then said: As for His Word: Nay! They are unbelievers in the meeting of their Lord, and when He mentioned the Believer: Who know that they shall meet their Lord, and His Word for other than the Believers: Till the day when they shall meet Him because they failed to perform towards Allah what they had promised with Him, and also His Word: Therefore, whoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds. As for His Word: Nay! They are unbelievers in the meeting of their Lord, i.e. the raising from death [al-ba`th] so Allah, the Mighty and High, has named it His Meeting. Likewise, He has mentioned the Believers: Who know that they shall meet their Lord, i.e. they are certain that they will be raised, gathered, accounted and paid with the reward or punishment. Therefore, the word zann (strong belief) in this context specifically is “certainty.” Like is His Word: Therefore, whoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds. And His Word: Whoever hopes to meet Allah, then meeting Him is forthcoming, i.e. whoever believes that he will be raised from death, then verily Allah’s promise about the reward and punishment is forthcoming. Hence, here “the meeting” is not “the viewing.” In fact, it is the raising from death. So understand this that verily all of “His Meeting” in the Book of Allah is meant to be “the raising from death.” And similar is His Word: their greetings on the Day when they meet Him shall be: “Peace,” i.e. that “the faith will not decline from their hearts the Day when they are raised again.” The man said: “You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah comfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward!” At that time the Imam (AS) said: As for His Word: And the guilty shall see the fire, then they shall think that they are going to fall into it, i.e. they will be certain that they are going to enter it. Similar is His Word: Surely I knew that I shall meet my account, He is saying that I am certain that I will be raised and then accounted for. Similar is His Word: On that Day Allah will pay back to them in full their just reward, and they shall know that Allah is the Evident Truth. And as for His Word about the hypocrites: “You began to think diverse thought of Allah,” then this zann is doubt and not certainty. Zann is of two types: doubt and surety. Therefore, that which is a matter of the Hereafter, then that is “the certainty” and that which is of a worldly matter is “the doubt.” Pay attention to what I have explained for you. The man said: “You have comfort me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah comfort you!” The Imam (AS) explained, And so for His Word, the Blessed and Exalted: And We will set up a just balance on the Day of Resurrection, so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; that is the balance of justice, all the creations will be taken to it on the Day of Judgment. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will grant credit to some of the creation from others with the balances. The compiler of this book says: In another tradition “the balance” stands for the Prophets and their Successors (sw) (this one sentence is by the Compiler. The passages after it are the continuation of the tradition.) And as for His Word, the Mighty and High: Therefore, We will not set up a balance for them on the Day of Resurrection, verily this is specifically. And as for His Word: These shall enter the garden, in which they shall be given sustenance without measure. Verily, the Messenger of Allah (sw) has said: Allah, the Mighty and High, says: “Those who observe Me and love one another for My Glory, deserve My love,” or he said, “My honor. Verily, on the Day of Judgment their faces will be of the light on the pulpits of light, over which shall be green cloths.” It was asked; “Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?” He replied: “A group of people who are neither Prophets, not martyrs, but they are ones who loved one another for the Glory of Allah. They will enter Paradise without any accountability.” We ask Allah, the Mighty and High, to make us of them for His Mercy. As for His Word: then as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is heavy…and as for him, whose measure (of good deeds) is light, i.e. verily, it means the accountability. The good deeds and the bad deeds will be weighed. The good deeds cause the balance to be weighty and the bad deeds cause the balance to be light. Then the Imam (AS) continued, As for His Word: Say: The Angels of Death who is given charges of you takes your souls, then to your Lord you shall be brought back, and His Word: Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and also His Word: Our messengers (angels) take his soul away, and they are not remiss, and also His Word: Those whom the angels take away their souls while they are unjust to themselves. And His Word: “those whom the angels take away their souls in a good state, that Peace be on you.” Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, directs all affairs as He wills and He assigns from His Creation whoever He wills and whatever He Wills. As for the Angels of Death, verily, Allah assigns him specifically whoever He will from His Creation and he assigns His Messengers from the angels specifically with whoever He wills of His Creation. The angels which Allah, Mighty be His remembrance, has named and assigned them specifically for whoever He wills from His Creation. Verily, He, the Blessed and Exalted, directs the affairs however He pleases. Not all knowledge makes capable a learned person of explaining to all the people, because there are strong and weak (in understanding) among them. Also, because of them are those who have the strength to bear it and of them are ones who cannot bear it, except for whoever Allah eases the bearing and helps him over it from His beloved ones specifically. Verily, it suffices you to know that Allah is the Reviver and the One who makes to dies. And verily He it is that takes the souls away through whoever He wills of His Creation from the His angels and other than angels. The man said: “You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah comfort you! And may Allah benefit all the Muslims by you!” `Ali (AS) said to the man, “If Allah has expanded your chest for you with what I have explained for you then you are, by the Splitter of Grain Seed and the Maker of Humanity, from the true Believers.” The man asked, “O Commander of Faithful, how is it possible for me to find out that I am of the true Believers?” He (AS) replied: No one knows that except for he who Allah has taught him with the tongue of His Prophet (sw), and the Messenger of Allah (sw) has bore witness for him with Paradise. Or he who Allah has expanded his chest to know what is in the Books which Allah, the Mighty and High, has revealed over His Messengers and Prophets. The man enquired, “O Commander of the Faithful, who has the strength for that?” He (AS) explained, “Whoever Allah expands his chest and directs him to Himself. It is up to you to serve Allah openly and secretly, for nothing equals worship.” The Compiler of this book says: The proof that the Producer is One and not more than that is that if there were two then the matter is not free from being one of the two; that each one of them is All-Powerful over prohibiting his associate form whatever He intends, or that they are not All-Powerful. If it is so then it is possible for both of them to be prevented, and whatever can be prevented has been brought into being. If they are not All-Powerful, they are incapable and deficient, and only things with beginnings can be as such. Therefore, it is correct that he One without Beginning One. The second proof is that each one of them is not powerful enough to hide from the other. Hence, if it is so, the one from whom one can hide, has a beginning. If he is not All-Powerful then he is incapable, and anything which is incapable has beginning as we have already explained earlier. This statement can be used to nullify the concept of two eternal beings. What Mani and Ibn Daysan have professed is nothing but their own superstition. The same nonsense which the Zoroastrians [majus] have professed regarding the Devil [Ahriman] is equally invalid according to this argument. This argument also applies to them. Thus, I have shortened my statement about both of them and did not individually deal with what they asked him (AS).",

    "englishText": "547. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Qasim Bin Muhammad, from Suleyman Bin Dawood Al-Munqary, from Hammaad, who has narrated the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) has said; ‘Luqman (as) said to his (as) son: ‘Whenever you travel with a group, take a lot of advice about them for your affairs and their affairs, and smile frequently in their faces, and be generous with your provisions. And if they call you, respond to them, and if they seek your support, help them. And be overcome them with three things – the length of silence, and the frequency of the Prayer, and generosity of the self with whatever is with you from the animal, or wealth, or provisions. And if they ask you to testify to ‘الْحَقِّ’ the truth, so testify for it, and exhaust your opinion for them if they consult you. Then do not advise them until you are sure about it and reconsider it, and do not answer in your advice until you stand regarding it, and sit, and sleep, and eat, and Pray, and you are utilising your thoughts and your wisdom with regards to your advice. So the one who does not refine his advice for the one who consulted him, Allah (azwj) Crucifies his opinion, and Removes from him the trust. And if you see your companions walking, so you should walk with them, and if you see them doing something, so do it with them, and if they give charity and give a loan, so give with them. And listen to the one who is older than you in age, and if he orders you and asks you, so say, Yes’, and do not say, ‘No’, for the ‘No’ is a fault and blameable. And if you are confused regarding your road, so stop and encamp, and if you are in doubt regarding the intended course, pause and plan. And if you see one person, do not ask him about your direction of road, and do not heed his guidance, for the one person in the wild is suspect for he could be an eye for the thieves, or he could be the Satan (la) who confused you. And be cautious of two persons as well, unless you can see what I (as) don’t, for the intellectual, when he sees something with his own eyes recognises the truth from it, and the witness can see what the absentee does not. O my son! And when the time of Salat comes up, so do not delay it for anything, and offer Salat and seek comfort from it for it is the Religion. And Pray in congregation even if there is pushing upon the head. And do not sleep upon your animal for that is injurious to its back, and that is not from the actions of the wise except if you are in a carriage and it is possible for you to stretch your joints. And when you come close to the destination, so descend from your animal and begin by feeding it before yourself. And when you intend to encamp, so it is upon you to remain in a land, which is good in colour, soft in soil, and abundance of grass. And if you encamp, so Pray two cycles before you sit down. And if you intend to fulfill your need (toilet), go far away. And when you embark (upon your journey) Pray two cycles, and say farewell to the land on which you spent time, and send greetings of peace upon it and upon its people, because for every patch of land has its inhabitants from the Angels. If you are able to, do not eat food until you begin by giving charity from it, so do it. And it is upon you to recite the Book of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic as long as you are riding. And it is upon you for the Glorification for as long as you are working. And it is upon you to supplicate for as long as you are alone. And beware of travelling in the first part of the night. And it is upon you to travel from the middle of the night to its end. And beware of raising your voice during your travel’.",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "547. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Qasim Bin Muhammad, from Suleyman Bin Dawood Al-Munqary, from Hammaad, who has narrated the following: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "Abu Abdullah (asws) has said; ‘Luqman (as) said to his (as) son: ‘Whenever you travel with a group, take a lot of advice about them for your affairs and their affairs, and smile frequently in their faces, and be generous with your provisions. And if they call you, respond to them, and if they seek your support, help them. And be overcome them with three things – the length of silence, and the frequency of the Prayer, and generosity of the self with whatever is with you from the animal, or wealth, or provisions. And if they ask you to testify to ‘الْحَقِّ’ the truth, so testify for it, and exhaust your opinion for them if they consult you. Then do not advise them until you are sure about it and reconsider it, and do not answer in your advice until you stand regarding it, and sit, and sleep, and eat, and Pray, and you are utilising your thoughts and your wisdom with regards to your advice. So the one who does not refine his advice for the one who consulted him, Allah (azwj) Crucifies his opinion, and Removes from him the trust. And if you see your companions walking, so you should walk with them, and if you see them doing something, so do it with them, and if they give charity and give a loan, so give with them. And listen to the one who is older than you in age, and if he orders you and asks you, so say, Yes’, and do not say, ‘No’, for the ‘No’ is a fault and blameable. And if you are confused regarding your road, so stop and encamp, and if you are in doubt regarding the intended course, pause and plan. And if you see one person, do not ask him about your direction of road, and do not heed his guidance, for the one person in the wild is suspect for he could be an eye for the thieves, or he could be the Satan (la) who confused you. And be cautious of two persons as well, unless you can see what I (as) don’t, for the intellectual, when he sees something with his own eyes recognises the truth from it, and the witness can see what the absentee does not. O my son! And when the time of Salat comes up, so do not delay it for anything, and offer Salat and seek comfort from it for it is the Religion. And Pray in congregation even if there is pushing upon the head. And do not sleep upon your animal for that is injurious to its back, and that is not from the actions of the wise except if you are in a carriage and it is possible for you to stretch your joints. And when you come close to the destination, so descend from your animal and begin by feeding it before yourself. And when you intend to encamp, so it is upon you to remain in a land, which is good in colour, soft in soil, and abundance of grass. And if you encamp, so Pray two cycles before you sit down. And if you intend to fulfill your need (toilet), go far away. And when you embark (upon your journey) Pray two cycles, and say farewell to the land on which you spent time, and send greetings of peace upon it and upon its people, because for every patch of land has its inhabitants from the Angels. If you are able to, do not eat food until you begin by giving charity from it, so do it. And it is upon you to recite the Book of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic as long as you are riding. And it is upon you for the Glorification for as long as you are working. And it is upon you to supplicate for as long as you are alone. And beware of travelling in the first part of the night. And it is upon you to travel from the middle of the night to its end. And beware of raising your voice during your travel’.",

    "englishText": "549. Ali Bin Al-Hassan Al-Mowdab, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Khalid and Ahmad Bin Muhammad, from Ali Bin Al-Hassan Al-Taymi together, from Ismail Bin Mahran who said, ‘Narrated to me Abdullah Al-Haris, from Jabir, who has narrated the following: Abu Ja’far (asws) has said: ‘Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) gave a sermon to the people at Siffeen, so he (asws) Praised Allah (azwj) and Extolled Him (azwj), and sent greetings upon the Prophet (saww), then said: ‘Having said that, Allah (azwj) the High has Made my (asws) rights to be obligatory upon you all as the Guardian of your matters (Wali-ul-Amr) and my (asws) status which Allah (azwj) Revealed for you, and similarly you have rights upon me (asws) as I (asws) have upon you. And the right is the most beautiful of the things in description; and most expansive in sharing. There is no other thing which is applied on one’s favour without being applied against him and it is not applied against him unless it is applied in his favour. The only one for whom it flows for and does not flow against is Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic only apart from His (azwj) creatures, for He (azwj) is Powerful over His (azwj) servants, and His (azwj) Justice regarding everything that He (azwj) Judges. But He (azwj) Made His (azwj) Rights upon the servants that they should be obedient to Him (azwj), and Made expiation against them by the good Rewards as Grace from Him (azwj), and the prolonged Generosity, and Expanding by increasing it for the one who is deserving of it. Then He (azwj) Made from His (azwj) ‘حُقُوقِهِ’ Rights, certain rights to be obligated for some people upon some other people. So He (azwj) Made it such that it obligates some of them for the others and does not obligate some except by the others. So the greatest of what Allah (azwj) has Necessitated from these rights is the rights of the governor upon the citizens and the rights of the citizens upon the governor, an obligation which Allah (azwj) has Obligated upon one and all. So He (azwj) has Made it to be a system for them and as strength for their Religion, and the establishment of the true Sunnah among them. The citizens will not be corrected except by the governor being correct, nor will the governor be correct except by the integrity of the citizens. So if the citizens fulfil the rights to the governor and the governor fulfils their rights as well, the truth will be strengthened between them. The manifesto of the Religion would be established, and the landmarks of justice would find fairness, and the Sunnah would flow smoothly. That would make life prosperous, and they would yearn for the survival of the government, and the enemies would despair from their ambitions. And if the citizens overcome the governor and the governor seeks to overcome them that are where the differences of speech emerge. The yearning of tyranny appears, and abundance of the lawlessness in the Religion, and the landmarks of the Sunnah are left. So they act by the desires, effects vanish, and illnesses of the souls abound. There is no fear of the penalties for infringement of the Laws, nor does confronting the falsehood seem great. So that is where the humiliation of the righteous and the honour for the evil ones is, and the ruination of the cities, and the greater the consequences will be for the servants in the presence of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. So come, o you people, to the co-operation to the obedience to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and the establishment by His (azwj) Justice, and the loyalty to His (azwj) Covenant, and the fairness to Him (azwj) is all of His (azwj) Rights, for there is nothing more needed for the servants than for advising with regards to that, and the beautiful co-operation to Him (azwj), and there is no one who intensifies his passion for striving for the Pleasure of Allah (azwj) to be able to reach its deserving point of fulfilling the Rights to Allah (azwj). But, from the obligatory Rights of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, upon the servants is the advice to each other with maximum efforts, and the co-operation upon the establishment of the truth among them. Then there is person, no matter how great his status regarding the truth, how magnified his preference regarding the truth is, would not be needless from the co-operation upon what Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Burdened him with from His (azwj) Rights. And there is no person, no matter how low he is in the affairs, and the eyes are looking down upon him, can remain without being helped upon or given support. And the people of the merits and the people of the Favours are more frequently in need of that, and everyone is in need of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic equally’. A man from his (asws) army answered him (asws). No one knew who he was and it is said that he had never been seen in his (asws) army before that day, nor was he seen after it. So he stood up and beautifully Extolled Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic by what the afflictions He (azwj) had Placed upon them, and His (azwj) Favours from the Obligation of His (azwj) rights against them, and accepted all what had been mentioned of the changing conditions with him (asws) and with them. Then said, ‘You (asws) are our Commander, and we are your (asws) citizens. It is by you (asws) that Allah (azwj) Brought us out of the humiliation and it is by your (asws) strength that He (azwj) Freed His (azwj) servant from the chains. So choose for us, and we will go by your (asws) choice, and make a plan and we would go by your (asws) plan, for you (asws) are a truthful speaker, and the successful ruler, and the authorised king. It is not permissible for us to disobey you (asws) in anything, nor do we compare our knowledge with your (asws) knowledge. You (asws) are great in regard to that choice, in our eyes, and your (asws) virtues are majestic within us’. So Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) answered him saying: ‘It is from the Rights that the one who Magnifies the Majesty of Allah (azwj) within himself and exalts His (azwj) position in his heart, everything else would seem little to him. And the one most deserving to be like that is the one to whom the Bounties of Allah (azwj) are great as well as His (azwj) Kind Favours to him, for no one would magnify the Bounties of Allah (azwj) except that the Rights of Allah (azwj) Increase upon him. And the lowest of the conditions of the governor in the presence of the righteous people is when he thinks of the love for pride and bases his affairs upon the arrogance, and I (asws) did not like to become lost in your thoughts that I (asws) would love the praise and listening to the praise. And I (asws) am not like that. Thanks be to Allah (azwj). And had I (asws) loved what you said, I (asws) would have abandoned it due to it lowering me (asws) for the Sake of Allah (azwj) that I (asws) should take to magnificence and greatness when He (azwj) is more deserving of it. Maybe the people consider it sweet to be praised after the affliction. So do not praise me (asws) with beautiful praises as it may take my (asws) soul out from being for the Sake of Allah (azwj), and the remainder of the rights which I (asws) have yet to fulfill and the obligations which I (asws) have yet to perform. So, do not speak to me (asws) as you speak to the tyrants, and do not have reservations from me (asws) like you have reservations in the presence of the unresponsive people, and do not flatter me (asws), and do not think that I (asws) consider it heavy regarding the right which is said to me (asws), or that I (asws) seek self-greatness, for it is not correct for me (asws). So the one who considers the rights to be a burden if they are told to him, or the justice if it is presented to him, it would become heavier for him to act in accordance with these two. So do not withhold from me (asws) speaking about the rights, or consultation with justice, for I (asws) not, with regards to myself (asws), above mistakes, nor do I (asws) feel secure from that in my (asws) deeds except if Allah (azwj) Suffices for myself (asws) in matter which He (azwj) has more Control over than what I (asws) have. But rather, I (asws) and you all are servants, belonging to the Lord (azwj). There is no lord apart from Him (azwj). He (azwj) Owns us what we do not own ourselves, and Took us out from what we used to be in to be in a situation which was correct for us. So He (azwj) Protected us after straying, by the Guidance. He (azwj) Gave us the vision after the blindness. So, the man who answered him (asws) before, answered him (asws), ‘By Allah (azwj), you (asws) are deserving of what I said. By Allah (azwj), you (asws) are more deserving than what I said, for His (azwj) Favours are such that we cannot deny, and Allah (azwj) Blessed and High has Burdened you (asws) with our citizens, and the Guardianship of our political affairs. So you (asws) have become (a representative of) our knowledge with which we can be guided by, and our Imam (asws) whom we follow, and every matter of yours (asws) is guidance, and every word of yours (asws) is educational. Our eyes have found delight with you (asws) in our lives, and our hearts are filled with bliss by you (asws), and we are amazed at the qualities, which are within you (asws) and our intellects are at a loss to describe. We are not saying to you (asws), ‘O you (asws) righteous Imam (asws) as a purification for you (asws), nor are we exaggerating in our intentions regarding our praising you (asws). And we are not becoming critical of your (asws) conviction, or the purity of your (asws) Religion, so we have no fear that you (asws) would innovate by the Bounties of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, or be tyrannical, or that arrogance should enter you (asws), but we are saying to you (asws) what we said in order to be closer to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic by revering you (asws), and Enhancing your (asws) merits, and appreciate the greatness of your (asws) command. So consider yourself (asws) and use, and give preference to the Command of Allah (azwj) over yourself (asws) and over us, for we are obedient with regards to whatever you (asws) order us for, and we submit to the commands along with that regarding what is beneficial for us’. Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) answered him, so he (asws) said: ‘And I (asws) am binding you in the Presence of Allah (azwj) to myself (asws) for your knowing that I (asws) am the guardian for your matters, for very shortly you will be gathered with me (asws). And I (asws) warn you of the Pausing in front of Him (azwj), and the Questioning about what we were in, then some of us will testify against the others, so do not testify today against what you will be testifying tomorrow, for there is nothing hidden from Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, nor is it permitted in His (azwj) Presence except for the good advice of the chests in all of the matters’. So the man answered him (asws), and it was said that the man was never seen again after this speech of his to Amir-ul-Momineen (asws), and he was bursting with emotion in his chest, and he spoke, and wailed which cut off his speech, and was anxious and choking, breaking his voice, being at the verge of collapse. So he Praised Allah (azwj) and Extolled Him (azwj), then pleaded before Him (azwj) of the horrors of what he had been cured of, from the great dangers, and the prolonged humiliation regarding the mischief to take place during his (asws) era, and the rebellions against him (asws) and the cutting off of what was from his (asws) government. Then he implored the matter to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic of the Bestowing of Favours on him (asws), and the Dispelling (dangers) from him (asws), and then Extolled Him (azwj) in a goodly manner. So he said, ‘O Lord (azwj) of the servants, and O Giver of tranquillity to the cities! How can we speak of Your (azwj) Grace, and how can we reach Your (azwj) Attributes from Your (azwj) Actions, and for me to reach the reality of the beauty of Your (azwj) Praise, or count the beauty of Your (azwj) Favours. So how can we, and it is due to you (asws) that the Bounties of Allah (azwj) have flowed towards us, and it is upon your (asws) hands that the causes of the good have arrived to us. Did you (asws) not become a sanctuary for the lowest of the low, and a saviour for the disobedient infidels? So by whom, except for the People (asws) of your (asws) Household, and by you (asws) that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Took us out from horrors of those dangers, and by whom did he (azwj) Rescue us from the thrones of distress, and by whom except by you (asws) did Allah (azwj) Make apparent the landmarks of our Religion, and Corrected what was spoilt from our Religion until we came to be mentioned, after the tyranny. And our eyes were delighted with a prosperous life when you (asws) became our Guardian as a favour to us, and you (asws) struggled and fulfilled to us all of your (asws) promises, and stood by all of your (asws) oaths to us. So you (asws) were a witness for the ones who were absent from us, and a successor of the People (asws) of the Household for us. And you (asws) were the strength of our weak ones, and the wealth of our poor ones, and a pillar for our great ones. It was your (asws) justice that brought us together in the matters, and accommodated us regarding the truth by your (asws) patience. You (asws) were, for us a familiarity if we saw you (asws), and a tranquillity whenever we mentioned you (asws). So which is the good deed, which you (asws) did not perform, and which is the righteous deeds which you (asws) did not act upon? And had it not been for the matter which we fear for you (asws) from it reaching you, which our efforts could change, and our strengths could defend you (asws) from it, we would be permitted to sacrifice ourselves for your (asws) defence, and repulse it from you (asws) by ourselves and our sons, we would put ourselves and our sons before you (asws). And we would make this choice, and reduce its danger from you (asws), and we would stand in our efforts in an attempt to defend you (asws) from your (asws) enemies. But He (azwj) is an Authority, which cannot be stopped, and a Strength which cannot decline, and a Lord (azwj) Who cannot be overcome. So if he (azwj) was to Bestow a Favour to us by Bestowing upon you (asws) good health, and be Merciful towards us by Keeping you (asws) alive, and be Compassionate to us by Relieving you (asws) of these difficulties from your (asws) situation to Keep you (asws) safe for us, and remain with us in front of us, we would narrate appreciation to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic for that, and Magnify Him (azwj), and Mention Him (azwj) constantly, and distribute half of our wealth as charity, and free half of our slaves, and narrate to Him (azwj) with humbleness in our selves, and be submissive in all of our affairs. And when He (azwj) Takes you to the Gardens, and Makes to Flow for you (asws) that which is inevitable, so no one would be able to change that which He (azwj) has Ordained, nor repulse from you (asws) His (azwj) Favours, nor will our hearts be opposed to that for that which He (azwj) has Chosen for you (asws) of what is with Him (azwj) over what you (asws) used to be in. But, we would weep if this authority (government) were to return back to humiliation, and for the Religion and the world to be consumed and we do not see for you (asws) a successor we can take our complaints to, nor a similar government we can have hope in establishing it’.",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "549. Ali Bin Al-Hassan Al-Mowdab, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Khalid and Ahmad Bin Muhammad, from Ali Bin Al-Hassan Al-Taymi together, from Ismail Bin Mahran who said, ‘Narrated to me Abdullah Al-Haris, from Jabir, who has narrated the following: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "Abu Ja’far (asws) has said: ‘Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) gave a sermon to the people at Siffeen, so he (asws) Praised Allah (azwj) and Extolled Him (azwj), and sent greetings upon the Prophet (saww), then said: ‘Having said that, Allah (azwj) the High has Made my (asws) rights to be obligatory upon you all as the Guardian of your matters (Wali-ul-Amr) and my (asws) status which Allah (azwj) Revealed for you, and similarly you have rights upon me (asws) as I (asws) have upon you. And the right is the most beautiful of the things in description; and most expansive in sharing. There is no other thing which is applied on one’s favour without being applied against him and it is not applied against him unless it is applied in his favour. The only one for whom it flows for and does not flow against is Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic only apart from His (azwj) creatures, for He (azwj) is Powerful over His (azwj) servants, and His (azwj) Justice regarding everything that He (azwj) Judges. But He (azwj) Made His (azwj) Rights upon the servants that they should be obedient to Him (azwj), and Made expiation against them by the good Rewards as Grace from Him (azwj), and the prolonged Generosity, and Expanding by increasing it for the one who is deserving of it. Then He (azwj) Made from His (azwj) ‘حُقُوقِهِ’ Rights, certain rights to be obligated for some people upon some other people. So He (azwj) Made it such that it obligates some of them for the others and does not obligate some except by the others. So the greatest of what Allah (azwj) has Necessitated from these rights is the rights of the governor upon the citizens and the rights of the citizens upon the governor, an obligation which Allah (azwj) has Obligated upon one and all. So He (azwj) has Made it to be a system for them and as strength for their Religion, and the establishment of the true Sunnah among them. The citizens will not be corrected except by the governor being correct, nor will the governor be correct except by the integrity of the citizens. So if the citizens fulfil the rights to the governor and the governor fulfils their rights as well, the truth will be strengthened between them. The manifesto of the Religion would be established, and the landmarks of justice would find fairness, and the Sunnah would flow smoothly. That would make life prosperous, and they would yearn for the survival of the government, and the enemies would despair from their ambitions. And if the citizens overcome the governor and the governor seeks to overcome them that are where the differences of speech emerge. The yearning of tyranny appears, and abundance of the lawlessness in the Religion, and the landmarks of the Sunnah are left. So they act by the desires, effects vanish, and illnesses of the souls abound. There is no fear of the penalties for infringement of the Laws, nor does confronting the falsehood seem great. So that is where the humiliation of the righteous and the honour for the evil ones is, and the ruination of the cities, and the greater the consequences will be for the servants in the presence of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. So come, o you people, to the co-operation to the obedience to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and the establishment by His (azwj) Justice, and the loyalty to His (azwj) Covenant, and the fairness to Him (azwj) is all of His (azwj) Rights, for there is nothing more needed for the servants than for advising with regards to that, and the beautiful co-operation to Him (azwj), and there is no one who intensifies his passion for striving for the Pleasure of Allah (azwj) to be able to reach its deserving point of fulfilling the Rights to Allah (azwj). But, from the obligatory Rights of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, upon the servants is the advice to each other with maximum efforts, and the co-operation upon the establishment of the truth among them. Then there is person, no matter how great his status regarding the truth, how magnified his preference regarding the truth is, would not be needless from the co-operation upon what Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Burdened him with from His (azwj) Rights. And there is no person, no matter how low he is in the affairs, and the eyes are looking down upon him, can remain without being helped upon or given support. And the people of the merits and the people of the Favours are more frequently in need of that, and everyone is in need of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic equally’. A man from his (asws) army answered him (asws). No one knew who he was and it is said that he had never been seen in his (asws) army before that day, nor was he seen after it. So he stood up and beautifully Extolled Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic by what the afflictions He (azwj) had Placed upon them, and His (azwj) Favours from the Obligation of His (azwj) rights against them, and accepted all what had been mentioned of the changing conditions with him (asws) and with them. Then said, ‘You (asws) are our Commander, and we are your (asws) citizens. It is by you (asws) that Allah (azwj) Brought us out of the humiliation and it is by your (asws) strength that He (azwj) Freed His (azwj) servant from the chains. So choose for us, and we will go by your (asws) choice, and make a plan and we would go by your (asws) plan, for you (asws) are a truthful speaker, and the successful ruler, and the authorised king. It is not permissible for us to disobey you (asws) in anything, nor do we compare our knowledge with your (asws) knowledge. You (asws) are great in regard to that choice, in our eyes, and your (asws) virtues are majestic within us’. So Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) answered him saying: ‘It is from the Rights that the one who Magnifies the Majesty of Allah (azwj) within himself and exalts His (azwj) position in his heart, everything else would seem little to him. And the one most deserving to be like that is the one to whom the Bounties of Allah (azwj) are great as well as His (azwj) Kind Favours to him, for no one would magnify the Bounties of Allah (azwj) except that the Rights of Allah (azwj) Increase upon him. And the lowest of the conditions of the governor in the presence of the righteous people is when he thinks of the love for pride and bases his affairs upon the arrogance, and I (asws) did not like to become lost in your thoughts that I (asws) would love the praise and listening to the praise. And I (asws) am not like that. Thanks be to Allah (azwj). And had I (asws) loved what you said, I (asws) would have abandoned it due to it lowering me (asws) for the Sake of Allah (azwj) that I (asws) should take to magnificence and greatness when He (azwj) is more deserving of it. Maybe the people consider it sweet to be praised after the affliction. So do not praise me (asws) with beautiful praises as it may take my (asws) soul out from being for the Sake of Allah (azwj), and the remainder of the rights which I (asws) have yet to fulfill and the obligations which I (asws) have yet to perform. So, do not speak to me (asws) as you speak to the tyrants, and do not have reservations from me (asws) like you have reservations in the presence of the unresponsive people, and do not flatter me (asws), and do not think that I (asws) consider it heavy regarding the right which is said to me (asws), or that I (asws) seek self-greatness, for it is not correct for me (asws). So the one who considers the rights to be a burden if they are told to him, or the justice if it is presented to him, it would become heavier for him to act in accordance with these two. So do not withhold from me (asws) speaking about the rights, or consultation with justice, for I (asws) not, with regards to myself (asws), above mistakes, nor do I (asws) feel secure from that in my (asws) deeds except if Allah (azwj) Suffices for myself (asws) in matter which He (azwj) has more Control over than what I (asws) have. But rather, I (asws) and you all are servants, belonging to the Lord (azwj). There is no lord apart from Him (azwj). He (azwj) Owns us what we do not own ourselves, and Took us out from what we used to be in to be in a situation which was correct for us. So He (azwj) Protected us after straying, by the Guidance. He (azwj) Gave us the vision after the blindness. So, the man who answered him (asws) before, answered him (asws), ‘By Allah (azwj), you (asws) are deserving of what I said. By Allah (azwj), you (asws) are more deserving than what I said, for His (azwj) Favours are such that we cannot deny, and Allah (azwj) Blessed and High has Burdened you (asws) with our citizens, and the Guardianship of our political affairs. So you (asws) have become (a representative of) our knowledge with which we can be guided by, and our Imam (asws) whom we follow, and every matter of yours (asws) is guidance, and every word of yours (asws) is educational. Our eyes have found delight with you (asws) in our lives, and our hearts are filled with bliss by you (asws), and we are amazed at the qualities, which are within you (asws) and our intellects are at a loss to describe. We are not saying to you (asws), ‘O you (asws) righteous Imam (asws) as a purification for you (asws), nor are we exaggerating in our intentions regarding our praising you (asws). And we are not becoming critical of your (asws) conviction, or the purity of your (asws) Religion, so we have no fear that you (asws) would innovate by the Bounties of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, or be tyrannical, or that arrogance should enter you (asws), but we are saying to you (asws) what we said in order to be closer to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic by revering you (asws), and Enhancing your (asws) merits, and appreciate the greatness of your (asws) command. So consider yourself (asws) and use, and give preference to the Command of Allah (azwj) over yourself (asws) and over us, for we are obedient with regards to whatever you (asws) order us for, and we submit to the commands along with that regarding what is beneficial for us’. Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) answered him, so he (asws) said: ‘And I (asws) am binding you in the Presence of Allah (azwj) to myself (asws) for your knowing that I (asws) am the guardian for your matters, for very shortly you will be gathered with me (asws). And I (asws) warn you of the Pausing in front of Him (azwj), and the Questioning about what we were in, then some of us will testify against the others, so do not testify today against what you will be testifying tomorrow, for there is nothing hidden from Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, nor is it permitted in His (azwj) Presence except for the good advice of the chests in all of the matters’. So the man answered him (asws), and it was said that the man was never seen again after this speech of his to Amir-ul-Momineen (asws), and he was bursting with emotion in his chest, and he spoke, and wailed which cut off his speech, and was anxious and choking, breaking his voice, being at the verge of collapse. So he Praised Allah (azwj) and Extolled Him (azwj), then pleaded before Him (azwj) of the horrors of what he had been cured of, from the great dangers, and the prolonged humiliation regarding the mischief to take place during his (asws) era, and the rebellions against him (asws) and the cutting off of what was from his (asws) government. Then he implored the matter to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic of the Bestowing of Favours on him (asws), and the Dispelling (dangers) from him (asws), and then Extolled Him (azwj) in a goodly manner. So he said, ‘O Lord (azwj) of the servants, and O Giver of tranquillity to the cities! How can we speak of Your (azwj) Grace, and how can we reach Your (azwj) Attributes from Your (azwj) Actions, and for me to reach the reality of the beauty of Your (azwj) Praise, or count the beauty of Your (azwj) Favours. So how can we, and it is due to you (asws) that the Bounties of Allah (azwj) have flowed towards us, and it is upon your (asws) hands that the causes of the good have arrived to us. Did you (asws) not become a sanctuary for the lowest of the low, and a saviour for the disobedient infidels? So by whom, except for the People (asws) of your (asws) Household, and by you (asws) that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Took us out from horrors of those dangers, and by whom did he (azwj) Rescue us from the thrones of distress, and by whom except by you (asws) did Allah (azwj) Make apparent the landmarks of our Religion, and Corrected what was spoilt from our Religion until we came to be mentioned, after the tyranny. And our eyes were delighted with a prosperous life when you (asws) became our Guardian as a favour to us, and you (asws) struggled and fulfilled to us all of your (asws) promises, and stood by all of your (asws) oaths to us. So you (asws) were a witness for the ones who were absent from us, and a successor of the People (asws) of the Household for us. And you (asws) were the strength of our weak ones, and the wealth of our poor ones, and a pillar for our great ones. It was your (asws) justice that brought us together in the matters, and accommodated us regarding the truth by your (asws) patience. You (asws) were, for us a familiarity if we saw you (asws), and a tranquillity whenever we mentioned you (asws). So which is the good deed, which you (asws) did not perform, and which is the righteous deeds which you (asws) did not act upon? And had it not been for the matter which we fear for you (asws) from it reaching you, which our efforts could change, and our strengths could defend you (asws) from it, we would be permitted to sacrifice ourselves for your (asws) defence, and repulse it from you (asws) by ourselves and our sons, we would put ourselves and our sons before you (asws). And we would make this choice, and reduce its danger from you (asws), and we would stand in our efforts in an attempt to defend you (asws) from your (asws) enemies. But He (azwj) is an Authority, which cannot be stopped, and a Strength which cannot decline, and a Lord (azwj) Who cannot be overcome. So if he (azwj) was to Bestow a Favour to us by Bestowing upon you (asws) good health, and be Merciful towards us by Keeping you (asws) alive, and be Compassionate to us by Relieving you (asws) of these difficulties from your (asws) situation to Keep you (asws) safe for us, and remain with us in front of us, we would narrate appreciation to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic for that, and Magnify Him (azwj), and Mention Him (azwj) constantly, and distribute half of our wealth as charity, and free half of our slaves, and narrate to Him (azwj) with humbleness in our selves, and be submissive in all of our affairs. And when He (azwj) Takes you to the Gardens, and Makes to Flow for you (asws) that which is inevitable, so no one would be able to change that which He (azwj) has Ordained, nor repulse from you (asws) His (azwj) Favours, nor will our hearts be opposed to that for that which He (azwj) has Chosen for you (asws) of what is with Him (azwj) over what you (asws) used to be in. But, we would weep if this authority (government) were to return back to humiliation, and for the Religion and the world to be consumed and we do not see for you (asws) a successor we can take our complaints to, nor a similar government we can have hope in establishing it’.",

    "englishText": "560. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, and a number of our companions, from Sahl Bin Ziyad, together from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Ibrahim Bin Abu Ziyad Al-Karkhy who said: ‘I heard Abu Abdullah (asws) saying that: ‘Ibrahim (as) was born at Kowsy Ruba, and his (as) father was from its inhabitants, and the mother of Ibrahim (as), and the mother of Lut (as) were Sara and Warqa’ (and in another copy ‘Ruqayya’), and were sisters, and they were both the daughters of Lahij (as). And Lahij (as) was a Prophet (as), a Warner, but was not a Messenger (as). And Ibrahim (as) was, in his (as) youth, upon the nature which Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Created, to the extent that Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Guided him (as) to His (azwj) Religion, and Chose him (as). And he (as) married Sara, the daughter of Lahij (as), the daughter of his (as) maternal aunt. And Sara was the owner of a lot of assets, and vast lands, and of good financial condition, and Ibrahim (as) was the owner of all what she had owned. So he (as) managed it, and corrected the affairs, and increased the assets and plantations considerably, to the extent that he (as) became the most affluent man in the land of Kowsy Ruba. And when Ibrahim (as) broke the idols, Nimrod (la) ordered his (as) capture, and they built a platform, and gathered the firewood around it and ignited the fire, and threw Ibrahim (as) via a catapult to be burnt by it. Then they relaxed until the fire burnt out. Then they looked at the platform and there was Ibrahim (as), safe and sound, but the ropes that he (as) was bound by had been burnt to ashes. So they informed Nimrod (la) of his (as) news. So he (la) ordered them to exile Ibrahim (as) from his (as) city, and prevent him (as) from the taking his (as) assets and his (as) wealth with him (as). So Ibrahim (as) disputed with them with regards to that. He (as) said: ‘If you (as) are confiscating my (as) assets and my (as) wealth, therefore it is my (as) right against you that you should return to me (as) what has gone from my (as) lifetime in your city’, and he (as) argued against the judge of Nimrod (la), so he judged that Ibrahim (as) should submit to him (la) all of what he (as) had acquired in their city, and that Nimrod (la) to return what had gone from his (as) life. The news of that reached Nimrod (la), so he (la) ordered that they should open the way for him (as) and allow him (as) to take his (as) assets, and his (as) wealth, and throw him (as) out from their city to Syria. So Ibrahim (as) went out, and with him (as) was Lut (as) who would not separate from him (as), and Sara, and said to them: ‘I (as) am going to my (as) Lord (azwj) to be Guided by Him (azwj)’ – meaning Bayt Al-Maqdis. So Ibrahim (as) took his (as) assets, and his (as) wealth, and constructed a carriage (Taboot), and made Sara to be in it, and locked it with locks, due to his (as) honour from it, and went until he (as) exited from the authority of Nimrod (la) and went to the authority of a man from the Coptics called Araarat. So they passed by a tax collector of his. The tax collector stopped him (as) in order to tax him (as) for what was with him (as). So when he (as) ended up with the tax collector and with him (as) was the carriage (Taboot), the tax collector said to Ibrahim (as), ‘Open this carriage (Taboot) until whatever is in it gets displayed’. So Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘Say whatever you like with regards to it, from the gold or the silver and I (as) shall pay it as tax, but do not open it’. The tax collector refused until he opened it, and Ibrahim (as) was angry over its opening. So when Sara came out, and she had good qualities and was very beautiful, the tax collector said to him (as), ‘What is (the relationship of) this woman to you (as)?’ Ibrahim (as) said; ‘She is my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife) and the daughter of my (as) aunt’. So the tax collector said to him (as), ‘So what made you (as) to place her in this carriage (Taboot)?’ Ibrahim (as) said: ‘The honour (Ghairat) against anyone looking at her’. So the tax collector said to him (as), ‘I will not leave you (as) to depart until I let the king know of her condition and yours (as)’. So he sent a messenger to the king, who let him know, and the king sent a messenger from him telling them to bring him (as) to him. So Ibrahim (as) said to them: ‘I (as) will not separate from the carriage (Taboot) even if my (as) soul separates from my (as) body’. So they informed the king about that, and the king sent a message that they should bring him (as) and the box with him (as). So they took Ibrahim (as), and the carriage (Taboot), and all what was with him (as) until they came up to the king. The king said to him (as), ‘Open the carriage (Taboot)!’ So Ibrahim (as) said: ‘O king! In it is my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife), the daughter of my (as) aunt, and I (as) am prepared to ransom all what is with me (as)’. The king got angry and forced Ibrahim (as) to open it. So when he saw Sara, he could not control his foolishness, and extended his hand towards her. Ibrahim (as) turned his (as) face away from her and from him due to his (as) honour (Ghairat) from it, and said: ‘Our Allah (azwj)! Withhold his hand from my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife) and daughter of my (as) aunt!’ So his hand could not arrive to her nor would it return back to him. So the king said to him (as), ‘Was it your (as) Lord (azwj) Who did this to me?’ He (as) said to him: ‘Yes. Surely, my (as) Lord (azwj) is Honourable (Ghayyour). He (azwj) Abhors the Prohibited, and He (azwj) is the One Who Made this situation between you and what you intended from the Prohibited’. The king said to him (as), ‘So supplicate to your (as) God that He (azwj) should Return my hand back to me. If He (azwj) Answers you (as), I will never present (myself) to her’. Ibrahim (as) said: ‘My (as) God! Return his hand back to him, so that he would refrain from my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife)’. So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Returned his hand back to him. The king came near to her and looked at her, then extended his hand around her. So Ibrahim (as) turned his (as) face away from it due to his (as) honour (Ghairat) from it, and said; ‘Our Allah (azwj)! Withhold his hand from her! So his hand withered and could not arrive to her. So the king said to Ibrahim (as), ‘Surely your (as) Lord (azwj) is Honourable (Ghayyour) and so are you, so supplicate to your God that He (azwj) should return my hand back to me, for it is an action that I shall not repeat. Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘I (as) will ask Him (azwj) upon the condition that you will not ask me (as) again to supplicate to Him (azwj)’. The king said, ‘Yes’. So Ibrahim (as) said: ‘Our Allah (azwj)! If he is truthful, Return his hand! His hand returned back to him. So when the king saw that from the honour which he had never seen before, and saw the Sign in (the return of) his hand, he magnified Ibrahim (as), and endowed him (as) (with gifts), and honoured him (as), and let him (as) leave and said to him (as), ‘I grant you (as) safety from displaying her, or for anything else which is with you (as). So go to wherever you like, but I have a need from you (as)’. Ibrahim (as) said: ‘What is it?’ He said to him (as), ‘I would love it if you (as) would permit me that I should give her an attendant who is a Coptic woman who has beauty and intellect, who will serve her’. So Ibrahim (as) gave him permission for that. So he called for her, and gifted her to Sara, and she is Hajar, mother of Ismail (as). Ibrahim (as) travelled with all of what was with him (as), and the king came out with him, walking behind Ibrahim (as), in respect of Ibrahim (as) and for his (as) prestige. So Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Revealed to Ibrahim (as): “Pause, and do not walk in front of the domineering tyrant and he walks behind you (as), but make him to be in front of you (as) and walk, and show him respect, and prestige, for he is domineering, and it is necessary for there to be authorities in the earth, be they righteous or immoral”. So Ibrahim (as) paused and said to the king: ‘Wait, for my (as) God has revealed unto me (as) at this very moment that I (as) should show you respect, and honour you, and make you to walk in front of me (as), and I (as) should walk behind you, due to your majesty’. So the king said to him (as), ‘This has been Revealed unto you (as)?’ Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘Yes’. So the king said to him (as), ‘I testify that surely your (as) God is Friendly, Lenient, generous, and that you are making me incline towards your (as) Religion’. And the king bade farewell to them. So Ibrahim (as) journeyed until he (as) encamped at the high place of Syria, and left behind Lut (as) in the lower valleys of Syria. Then, when the birth of a son was delayed, Ibrahim (as) said to Sara: ‘If you want, you can sell Hajar to me (as), perhaps Allah (azwj) would Grant us the sustenance of a son from it, who would become a successor for us’. So Ibrahim (as) bought Hajar from Sara. He (as) went to her, and she gave birth to Ismail (as)’.",

لَاحِجٍ وَ هِيَ ابْنَةُ خَالَتِهِ وَ كَانَتْ سَارَةُ صَاحِبَةَ مَاشِيَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ وَ أَرْضٍ وَاسِعَةٍ وَ حَالٍ حَسَنَةٍ وَ كَانَتْ قَدْ مَلَّكَتْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) جَمِيعَ مَا كَانَتْ تَمْلِكُهُ فَقَامَ فِيهِ وَ أَصْلَحَهُ وَ كَثُرَتِ الْمَاشِيَةُ وَ الزَّرْعُ حَتَّى لَمْ يَكُنْ بِأَرْضِ كُوثَى رُبَا رَجُلٌ أَحْسَنُ حَالًا مِنْهُ وَ إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) لَمَّا كَسَرَ أَصْنَامَ نُمْرُودَ أَمَرَ بِهِ نُمْرُودُ فَأُوثِقَ وَ عَمِلَ لَهُ حَيْراً وَ جَمَعَ لَهُ فِيهِ الْحَطَبَ وَ أَلْهَبَ فِيهِ النَّارَ ثُمَّ قَذَفَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) فِي النَّارِ لِتُحْرِقَهُ ثُمَّ اعْتَزَلُوهَا حَتَّى خَمَدَتِ النَّارُ ثُمَّ أَشْرَفُوا عَلَى الْحَيْرِ فَإِذَا هُمْ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) سَلِيماً مُطْلَقاً مِنْ وَثَاقِهِ فَأُخْبِرَ نُمْرُودُ خَبَرَهُ فَأَمَرَهُمْ أَنْ يَنْفُوا إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) مِنْ بِلَادِهِ وَ أَنْ يَمْنَعُوهُ مِنَ الْخُرُوجِ بِمَاشِيَتِهِ وَ مَالِهِ فَحَاجَّهُمْ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) عِنْدَ ذَلِكَ فَقَالَ إِنْ أَخَذْتُمْ مَاشِيَتِي وَ مَالِي فَإِنَّ حَقِّي عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْ تَرُدُّوا عَلَيَّ مَا ذَهَبَ مِنْ عُمُرِي فِي بِلَادِكُمْ وَ اخْتَصَمُوا إِلَى قَاضِي نُمْرُودَ فَقَضَى عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) أَنْ يُسَلِّمَ إِلَيْهِمْ جَمِيعَ مَا أَصَابَ فِي بِلَادِهِمْ وَ قَضَى عَلَى أَصْحَابِ نُمْرُودَ أَنْ يَرُدُّوا عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) مَا ذَهَبَ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ فِي بِلَادِهِمْ فَأُخْبِرَ بِذَلِكَ نُمْرُودُ فَأَمَرَهُمْ أَنْ يُخَلُّوا سَبِيلَهُ وَ سَبِيلَ مَاشِيَتِهِ وَ مَالِهِ وَ أَنْ يُخْرِجُوهُ وَ قَالَ إِنَّهُ إِنْ بَقِيَ فِي بِلَادِكُمْ أَفْسَدَ دِينَكُمْ وَ أَضَرَّ بِآلِهَتِكُمْ فَأَخْرَجُوا إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَ لُوطاً مَعَهُ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمَا مِنْ بِلَادِهِمْ إِلَى الشَّامِ فَخَرَجَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ وَ مَعَهُ لُوطٌ لَا يُفَارِقُهُ وَ سَارَةُ وَ قَالَ لَهُمْ إِنِّي ذاهِبٌ إِلى رَبِّي سَيَهْدِينِ يَعْنِي بَيْتَ الْمَقْدِسِ فَتَحَمَّلَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) بِمَاشِيَتِهِ وَ مَالِهِ وَ عَمِلَ تَابُوتاً وَ جَعَلَ فِيهِ سَارَةَ وَ شَدَّ عَلَيْهَا الْأَغْلَاقَ غَيْرَةً مِنْهُ عَلَيْهَا وَ مَضَى حَتَّى خَرَجَ مِنْ سُلْطَانِ نُمْرُودَ وَ صَارَ إِلَى سُلْطَانِ رَجُلٍ مِنَ الْقِبْطِ يُقَالُ لَهُ عَرَارَةُ فَمَرَّ بِعَاشِرٍ لَهُ فَاعْتَرَضَهُ الْعَاشِرُ لِيَعْشُرَ مَا مَعَهُ فَلَمَّا انْتَهَى إِلَى الْعَاشِرِ وَ مَعَهُ التَّابُوتُ قَالَ الْعَاشِرُ لِإِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) افْتَحْ هَذَا التَّابُوتَ حَتَّى نَعْشُرَ مَا فِيهِ فَقَالَ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) قُلْ مَا شِئْتَ فِيهِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ أَوْ فِضَّةٍ حَتَّى نُعْطِيَ عُشْرَهُ وَ لَا نَفْتَحَهُ قَالَ فَأَبَى الْعَاشِرُ إِلَّا فَتْحَهُ قَالَ وَ غَضِبَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) عَلَى فَتْحِهِ فَلَمَّا بَدَتْ لَهُ سَارَةُ وَ كَانَتْ مَوْصُوفَةً بِالْحُسْنِ وَ الْجَمَالِ قَالَ لَهُ الْعَاشِرُ مَا هَذِهِ الْمَرْأَةُ مِنْكَ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) هِيَ حُرْمَتِي وَ ابْنَةُ خَالَتِي فَقَالَ لَهُ الْعَاشِرُ فَمَا دَعَاكَ إِلَى أَنْ خَبَيْتَهَا فِي هَذَا التَّابُوتِ فَقَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) الْغَيْرَةُ عَلَيْهَا أَنْ يَرَاهَا أَحَدٌ فَقَالَ لَهُ الْعَاشِرُ لَسْتُ أَدَعُكَ تَبْرَحُ حَتَّى أُعْلِمَ الْمَلِكَ حَالَهَا وَ حَالَكَ قَالَ فَبَعَثَ رَسُولًا إِلَى الْمَلِكِ فَأَعْلَمَهُ فَبَعَثَ الْمَلِكُ رَسُولًا مِنْ قِبَلِهِ لِيَأْتُوهُ بِالتَّابُوتِ فَأَتَوْا لِيَذْهَبُوا بِهِ فَقَالَ لَهُمْ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) إِنِّي لَسْتُ أُفَارِقُ التَّابُوتَ حَتَّى تُفَارِقَ رُوحِي جَسَدِي فَأَخْبَرُوا الْمَلِكَ بِذَلِكَ فَأَرْسَلَ الْمَلِكُ أَنِ احْمِلُوهُ وَ التَّابُوتَ مَعَهُ فَحَمَلُوا إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) و التَّابُوتَ وَ جَمِيعَ مَا كَانَ مَعَهُ حَتَّى أُدْخِلَ عَلَى الْمَلِكِ فَقَالَ لَهُ الْمَلِكُ افْتَحِ التَّابُوتَ فَقَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) أَيُّهَا الْمَلِكُ إِنَّ فِيهِ حُرْمَتِي وَ ابْنَةَ خَالَتِي وَ أَنَا مُفْتَدٍ فَتْحَهُ بِجَمِيعِ مَا مَعِي قَالَ فَغَضِبَ الْمَلِكُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَى فَتْحِهِ فَلَمَّا رَأَى سَارَةَ لَمْ يَمْلِكْ حِلْمُهُ سَفَهَهُ أَنْ مَدَّ يَدَهُ إِلَيْهَا فَأَعْرَضَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) بِوَجْهِهِ عَنْهَا وَ عَنْهُ غَيْرَةً مِنْهُ وَ قَالَ اللَّهُمَّ احْبِسْ يَدَهُ عَنْ حُرْمَتِي وَ ابْنَةِ خَالَتِي فَلَمْ تَصِلْ يَدُهُ إِلَيْهَا وَ لَمْ تَرْجِعْ إِلَيْهِ فَقَالَ لَهُ الْمَلِكُ إِنَّ إِلَهَكَ هُوَ الَّذِي فَعَلَ بِي هَذَا فَقَالَ لَهُ نَعَمْ إِنَّ إِلَهِي غَيُورٌ يَكْرَهُ الْحَرَامَ وَ هُوَ الَّذِي حَالَ بَيْنَكَ وَ بَيْنَ مَا أَرَدْتَ مِنَ الْحَرَامِ فَقَالَ لَهُ الْمَلِكُ فَادْعُ إِلَهَكَ يَرُدَّ عَلَيَّ يَدِي فَإِنْ أَجَابَكَ فَلَمْ أَعْرِضْ لَهَا فَقَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) إِلَهِي رُدَّ عَلَيْهِ يَدَهُ لِيَكُفَّ عَنْ حُرْمَتِي قَالَ فَرَدَّ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ عَلَيْهِ يَدَهُ فَأَقْبَلَ الْمَلِكُ نَحْوَهَا بِبَصَرِهِ ثُمَّ أَعَادَ بِيَدِهِ نَحْوَهَا فَأَعْرَضَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) عَنْهُ بِوَجْهِهِ غَيْرَةً مِنْهُ وَ قَالَ اللَّهُمَّ احْبِسْ يَدَهُ عَنْهَا قَالَ فَيَبِسَتْ يَدُهُ وَ لَمْ تَصِلْ إِلَيْهَا فَقَالَ الْمَلِكُ لِإِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) إِنَّ إِلَهَكَ لَغَيُورٌ وَ إِنَّكَ لَغَيُورٌ فَادْعُ إِلَهَكَ يَرُدَّ عَلَيَّ يَدِي فَإِنَّهُ إِنْ فَعَلَ لَمْ أَعُدْ فَقَالَ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) أَسْأَلُهُ ذَلِكَ عَلَى أَنَّكَ إِنْ عُدْتَ لَمْ تَسْأَلْنِي أَنْ أَسْأَلَهُ فَقَالَ الْمَلِكُ نَعَمْ فَقَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ كَانَ صَادِقاً فَرُدَّ عَلَيْهِ يَدَهُ فَرَجَعَتْ إِلَيْهِ يَدُهُ فَلَمَّا رَأَى ذَلِكَ الْمَلِكُ مِنَ الْغَيْرَةِ مَا رَأَى وَ رَأَى الْآيَةَ فِي يَدِهِ عَظَّمَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) وَ هَابَهُ وَ أَكْرَمَهُ وَ اتَّقَاهُ وَ قَالَ لَهُ قَدْ أَمِنْتَ مِنْ أَنْ أَعْرِضَ لَهَا أَوْ لِشَيْ‏ءٍ مِمَّا مَعَكَ فَانْطَلِقْ حَيْثُ شِئْتَ وَ لَكِنْ لِي إِلَيْكَ حَاجَةٌ فَقَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) مَا هِيَ فَقَالَ لَهُ أُحِبُّ أَنْ تَأْذَنَ لِي أَنْ أُخْدِمَهَا قِبْطِيَّةً عِنْدِي جَمِيلَةً عَاقِلَةً تَكُونُ لَهَا خَادِماً قَالَ فَأَذِنَ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) فَدَعَا بِهَا فَوَهَبَهَا لِسَارَةَ وَ هِيَ هَاجَرُ أُمُّ إِسْمَاعِيلَ (عليه السلام) فَسَارَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) بِجَمِيعِ مَا مَعَهُ وَ خَرَجَ الْمَلِكُ مَعَهُ يَمْشِي خَلْفَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) إِعْظَاماً لِإِبْرَاهِيمَ (عليه السلام) وَ هَيْبَةً لَهُ فَأَوْحَى اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَ تَعَالَى إِلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ أَنْ قِفْ وَ لَا تَمْشِ قُدَّامَ الْجَبَّارِ الْمُتَسَلِّطِ وَ يَمْشِي هُوَ خَلْفَكَ وَ لَكِنِ اجْعَلْهُ أَمَامَكَ وَ امْشِ وَ عَظِّمْهُ وَ هَبْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مُسَلَّطٌ وَ لَا بُدَّ مِنْ إِمْرَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ بَرَّةٍ أَوْ فَاجِرَةٍ فَوَقَفَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) وَ قَالَ لِلْمَلِكِ امْضِ فَإِنَّ إِلَهِي أَوْحَى إِلَيَّ السَّاعَةَ أَنْ أُعَظِّمَكَ وَ أَهَابَكَ وَ أَنْ أُقَدِّمَكَ أَمَامِي وَ أَمْشِيَ خَلْفَكَ إِجْلَالًا لَكَ فَقَالَ لَهُ الْمَلِكُ أَوْحَى إِلَيْكَ بِهَذَا فَقَالَ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) نَعَمْ فَقَالَ لَهُ الْمَلِكُ أَشْهَدُ إِنَّ إِلَهَكَ لَرَفِيقٌ حَلِيمٌ كَرِيمٌ وَ إِنَّكَ تُرَغِّبُنِي فِي دِينِكَ قَالَ وَ وَدَّعَهُ الْمَلِكُ فَسَارَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) حَتَّى نَزَلَ بِأَعْلَى الشَّامَاتِ وَ خَلَّفَ

مِنْهَا وَلَداً فَيَكُونَ لَنَا خَلَفاً فَابْتَاعَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ (عليه السلام) هَاجَرَ مِنْ سَارَةَ فَوَقَعَ عَلَيْهَا فَوَلَدَتْ إِسْمَاعِيلَ (عليه السلام).",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "560. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, and a number of our companions, from Sahl Bin Ziyad, together from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Ibrahim Bin Abu Ziyad Al-Karkhy who said: ‘I heard Abu Abdullah (asws) saying that: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "‘Ibrahim (as) was born at Kowsy Ruba, and his (as) father was from its inhabitants, and the mother of Ibrahim (as), and the mother of Lut (as) were Sara and Warqa’ (and in another copy ‘Ruqayya’), and were sisters, and they were both the daughters of Lahij (as). And Lahij (as) was a Prophet (as), a Warner, but was not a Messenger (as). And Ibrahim (as) was, in his (as) youth, upon the nature which Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Created, to the extent that Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Guided him (as) to His (azwj) Religion, and Chose him (as). And he (as) married Sara, the daughter of Lahij (as), the daughter of his (as) maternal aunt. And Sara was the owner of a lot of assets, and vast lands, and of good financial condition, and Ibrahim (as) was the owner of all what she had owned. So he (as) managed it, and corrected the affairs, and increased the assets and plantations considerably, to the extent that he (as) became the most affluent man in the land of Kowsy Ruba. And when Ibrahim (as) broke the idols, Nimrod (la) ordered his (as) capture, and they built a platform, and gathered the firewood around it and ignited the fire, and threw Ibrahim (as) via a catapult to be burnt by it. Then they relaxed until the fire burnt out. Then they looked at the platform and there was Ibrahim (as), safe and sound, but the ropes that he (as) was bound by had been burnt to ashes. So they informed Nimrod (la) of his (as) news. So he (la) ordered them to exile Ibrahim (as) from his (as) city, and prevent him (as) from the taking his (as) assets and his (as) wealth with him (as). So Ibrahim (as) disputed with them with regards to that. He (as) said: ‘If you (as) are confiscating my (as) assets and my (as) wealth, therefore it is my (as) right against you that you should return to me (as) what has gone from my (as) lifetime in your city’, and he (as) argued against the judge of Nimrod (la), so he judged that Ibrahim (as) should submit to him (la) all of what he (as) had acquired in their city, and that Nimrod (la) to return what had gone from his (as) life. The news of that reached Nimrod (la), so he (la) ordered that they should open the way for him (as) and allow him (as) to take his (as) assets, and his (as) wealth, and throw him (as) out from their city to Syria. So Ibrahim (as) went out, and with him (as) was Lut (as) who would not separate from him (as), and Sara, and said to them: ‘I (as) am going to my (as) Lord (azwj) to be Guided by Him (azwj)’ – meaning Bayt Al-Maqdis. So Ibrahim (as) took his (as) assets, and his (as) wealth, and constructed a carriage (Taboot), and made Sara to be in it, and locked it with locks, due to his (as) honour from it, and went until he (as) exited from the authority of Nimrod (la) and went to the authority of a man from the Coptics called Araarat. So they passed by a tax collector of his. The tax collector stopped him (as) in order to tax him (as) for what was with him (as). So when he (as) ended up with the tax collector and with him (as) was the carriage (Taboot), the tax collector said to Ibrahim (as), ‘Open this carriage (Taboot) until whatever is in it gets displayed’. So Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘Say whatever you like with regards to it, from the gold or the silver and I (as) shall pay it as tax, but do not open it’. The tax collector refused until he opened it, and Ibrahim (as) was angry over its opening. So when Sara came out, and she had good qualities and was very beautiful, the tax collector said to him (as), ‘What is (the relationship of) this woman to you (as)?’ Ibrahim (as) said; ‘She is my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife) and the daughter of my (as) aunt’. So the tax collector said to him (as), ‘So what made you (as) to place her in this carriage (Taboot)?’ Ibrahim (as) said: ‘The honour (Ghairat) against anyone looking at her’. So the tax collector said to him (as), ‘I will not leave you (as) to depart until I let the king know of her condition and yours (as)’. So he sent a messenger to the king, who let him know, and the king sent a messenger from him telling them to bring him (as) to him. So Ibrahim (as) said to them: ‘I (as) will not separate from the carriage (Taboot) even if my (as) soul separates from my (as) body’. So they informed the king about that, and the king sent a message that they should bring him (as) and the box with him (as). So they took Ibrahim (as), and the carriage (Taboot), and all what was with him (as) until they came up to the king. The king said to him (as), ‘Open the carriage (Taboot)!’ So Ibrahim (as) said: ‘O king! In it is my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife), the daughter of my (as) aunt, and I (as) am prepared to ransom all what is with me (as)’. The king got angry and forced Ibrahim (as) to open it. So when he saw Sara, he could not control his foolishness, and extended his hand towards her. Ibrahim (as) turned his (as) face away from her and from him due to his (as) honour (Ghairat) from it, and said: ‘Our Allah (azwj)! Withhold his hand from my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife) and daughter of my (as) aunt!’ So his hand could not arrive to her nor would it return back to him. So the king said to him (as), ‘Was it your (as) Lord (azwj) Who did this to me?’ He (as) said to him: ‘Yes. Surely, my (as) Lord (azwj) is Honourable (Ghayyour). He (azwj) Abhors the Prohibited, and He (azwj) is the One Who Made this situation between you and what you intended from the Prohibited’. The king said to him (as), ‘So supplicate to your (as) God that He (azwj) should Return my hand back to me. If He (azwj) Answers you (as), I will never present (myself) to her’. Ibrahim (as) said: ‘My (as) God! Return his hand back to him, so that he would refrain from my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife)’. So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Returned his hand back to him. The king came near to her and looked at her, then extended his hand around her. So Ibrahim (as) turned his (as) face away from it due to his (as) honour (Ghairat) from it, and said; ‘Our Allah (azwj)! Withhold his hand from her! So his hand withered and could not arrive to her. So the king said to Ibrahim (as), ‘Surely your (as) Lord (azwj) is Honourable (Ghayyour) and so are you, so supplicate to your God that He (azwj) should return my hand back to me, for it is an action that I shall not repeat. Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘I (as) will ask Him (azwj) upon the condition that you will not ask me (as) again to supplicate to Him (azwj)’. The king said, ‘Yes’. So Ibrahim (as) said: ‘Our Allah (azwj)! If he is truthful, Return his hand! His hand returned back to him. So when the king saw that from the honour which he had never seen before, and saw the Sign in (the return of) his hand, he magnified Ibrahim (as), and endowed him (as) (with gifts), and honoured him (as), and let him (as) leave and said to him (as), ‘I grant you (as) safety from displaying her, or for anything else which is with you (as). So go to wherever you like, but I have a need from you (as)’. Ibrahim (as) said: ‘What is it?’ He said to him (as), ‘I would love it if you (as) would permit me that I should give her an attendant who is a Coptic woman who has beauty and intellect, who will serve her’. So Ibrahim (as) gave him permission for that. So he called for her, and gifted her to Sara, and she is Hajar, mother of Ismail (as). Ibrahim (as) travelled with all of what was with him (as), and the king came out with him, walking behind Ibrahim (as), in respect of Ibrahim (as) and for his (as) prestige. So Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Revealed to Ibrahim (as): “Pause, and do not walk in front of the domineering tyrant and he walks behind you (as), but make him to be in front of you (as) and walk, and show him respect, and prestige, for he is domineering, and it is necessary for there to be authorities in the earth, be they righteous or immoral”. So Ibrahim (as) paused and said to the king: ‘Wait, for my (as) God has revealed unto me (as) at this very moment that I (as) should show you respect, and honour you, and make you to walk in front of me (as), and I (as) should walk behind you, due to your majesty’. So the king said to him (as), ‘This has been Revealed unto you (as)?’ Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘Yes’. So the king said to him (as), ‘I testify that surely your (as) God is Friendly, Lenient, generous, and that you are making me incline towards your (as) Religion’. And the king bade farewell to them. So Ibrahim (as) journeyed until he (as) encamped at the high place of Syria, and left behind Lut (as) in the lower valleys of Syria. Then, when the birth of a son was delayed, Ibrahim (as) said to Sara: ‘If you want, you can sell Hajar to me (as), perhaps Allah (azwj) would Grant us the sustenance of a son from it, who would become a successor for us’. So Ibrahim (as) bought Hajar from Sara. He (as) went to her, and she gave birth to Ismail (as)’.",

    "englishText": "65-2 Al-Hakim Abu Ali Husayn ibn Ahmad al-Bayhaqi narrated that Muhammad ibn al-Sowli quoted on the authority of Harun ibn Abdullah al-Molhabi that De’bel al-Khoza’ee said, \"When the news of the death of Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) reached me, I was in Qum and I recited one of my poems in praise of him as follows:I see the Umayyads excused if they were to kill,But I see no reason why the Abbasids should at will;Sons of Harb, Marwan and their breedBanu Ma’eet, grudge and hate is their creed.People whom you had to fight in the early daysOf Islam to bring them to His ways.When they became in charge and did rule,They reverted to Kufr (unbelief) and left the Usool.Head towards Toos, to the grave siteOf the pure one, of the faith that is right,If you ever wish to remember Islam like me,Pristine, Islam of Muhammad and Ali.Two graves in Toos: one for the best of all,And the worst man people will ever recall.No good will reach the villain (Harun ar-Rashid) who is lying nighIn grave to one whose virtues reach the sky (Imam Ridha’),Nor will the pure suffer any harmWhen near the soul that will never calm.No indeed! Every soul shall reap what it did earnSo take what you will, or leave it to burn!\"Al-Sowli narrated that Oun ibn Muhammad said that Mansoor ibn Talha recited poems that he quoted on the authority of Abu Muhammad al-Yazidi who had said, “When Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) passed away, I recited an elegy for him as follows:What is wrong with Toos - may God not sanctify itWhich seizes a precious one each day.It began with Rashid when it grabbed him.Then it seconded it with Ar-Ridha’ Ali ibn MusaNot a regular leader was he,Rather a noble Imam - like the other ones.And the felicity of time turned into misfortunes!”I also found the following verses in Muhammad ibn Habib Dhabbi’s book:In Toos there is a tomb in which there lies an Imam DivineWhom we are enjoined to go visit his shrine.The tomb where Paradise is set up from early in the morningAnd is constantly granted greetings and peace.A tomb whose radiating rays illuminate the blindAnd its ashes treat ailments.A tomb portraying Muhammad in the eyesAnd his Trustee for by-standing believersThe eyes are humble to this allDue to the amazement in their thoughts deep withinA tomb in which those who reach at its regionTheir sins are unloaded from them when they depart.They will take with themselves an increased security from the ChastisementAnd are secured from ever suffering from poverty.God has accepted this for them on his (ar-Ridha’) behalfAnd thus the Pen is lifted off of them.If we have become needless of rain now,it is due to the clouds watering downWere it not for him, the clouds would have not poured down rain on this townThe tomb that holds Ali ibn MusaIs prouder than the land of Mecca.It is incumbent upon us to try to go visit itAs it is incumbent to respect those who reside around it.Whoever visits it recognizing his rightfulnessBy God, it is forbidden for the Fire to touch him.Surely tomorrow he shall have a praiseworthy rankWhose position will be in Gardens as the eternal abodeGod has guaranteed this for him.He has sworn to the One to Whom all pledges shall returnMay God’s Blessings be upon the Prophet MuhammadAli’s radiance and peace raised his rankMay God’s Blessings constantly be upon Az-ZahraSince the Lord knows well that she rightfully deserves it.And blessings be upon her, and then upon Al-HassanAnd upon Al-Husayn whose face shows his nobilityAnd upon Ali the virtuous and Muhammad.Blessings be upon all these Masters who are nobleand upon Ja’far - the educator and the pure-the finest blessings even though the pygmys may dislike itAnd As-Sadiq from whom we have inherited knowledgeOn which all the nations rely.Same be upon your father Musa and the ones who follow himAnd upon you be as long as Mercy lastsAnd upon the pure Muhammad - may his purity be increasedand upon Ali for as long as there is any talkingand upon Ar-Ridha’ - the son of Ar-Ridha’ - Al-Hassan whomall the towns were filled with darkness due to his demise,And blessings be upon his successor by whomthe perfect system will be completed.He is the one hoped for with whom guidance is to returnand the decrees are to be re-established.Were it not for the leaders one after the otherguidance would be extinguished - so would Islam.Each one will lead after the previous one untilthe days end with the Riser’s turnO son of the Prophet and the Proof of GodFor whom prayer and fasting has been establishedNone of you left before another one cameTo succeed him and treat the afflictions.All the same in terms of nobility and knowledgeWhether they lead in youth or old age.You are the means towards God and the firstWho know the right guidance and are its signs yourselves.You are the Masters of religion and the worldand have sanctity and protection from God.And only those who confess to your virtues are humansand those who deny are only beasts and animals.They are even more lost due to their disbeliefand their followers are subjected to arrows without heads and feathers.They benefit from your world,but are in their denial like livestock. ‏O blessings of God whom He bestows uponWhomever He chooses from amongst His creatures to bestow upon.If God hides your bodies from usHe left your spirit and order with us.Your souls are visibly availableEven after your bodies were led away from our eyes.The only difference between you and the Prophet being Prophethood,But your steps and deeds are the sameThe two tombs in Toos: in one is buried guidanceAnd a lost one in the other sees the Blazing Fire.Two tombs set side by sideOne is a Garden of Heaven in which a leader is visited,But the next one is a ditch out of Hell.In which constant thirst is generated for its corrupt resident.The nearness of the tomb of the corrupt to that of the pure oneIncreases his torture and not reduce it as he desires.Even though the two seem to be close, they are far apartand on him there are piles of torture.There comes no harm to you from the wicked one who builtThe tombs out of megaliths and marble so close by,but it kindles on him the greatest regrets,seeing that you are honored and he is damnedAnd the extent of the torture increases every hourAnd every day and every year.O if only I knew whether I shall live during the days of the RiserKilling your enemies with a sword in my hands.My two hands shall reach out to him with a burning thirst for youBut the thirst will not be quenched until I attain my goal.Of course, your tombs excite me whileOthers get excited with raised flags and tentsWho struggle to praise the affluent and the rich,While I am honored by and love reciting your praisesAnd I dedicate it (the poem) to Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’.To please him and for the intellects to get pleased with.Take it from Dhabbi - your servant whoIs insulted due to his servitude to you.If I respected the right of God upon you, it was becauseSurely there is a right for a guest upon his host even if its put off.Thus please accept from me this intention as a hostthen I will be enriched should you do soIf others have realized your love due to teaching,my love for you is due to an inspiration.",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "65-2 Al-Hakim Abu Ali Husayn ibn Ahmad al-Bayhaqi narrated that Muhammad ibn al-Sowli quoted on the authority of Harun ibn Abdullah al-Molhabi that De’bel al-Khoza’ee said, ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "\"When the news of the death of Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) reached me, I was in Qum and I recited one of my poems in praise of him as follows:I see the Umayyads excused if they were to kill,But I see no reason why the Abbasids should at will;Sons of Harb, Marwan and their breedBanu Ma’eet, grudge and hate is their creed.People whom you had to fight in the early daysOf Islam to bring them to His ways.When they became in charge and did rule,They reverted to Kufr (unbelief) and left the Usool.Head towards Toos, to the grave siteOf the pure one, of the faith that is right,If you ever wish to remember Islam like me,Pristine, Islam of Muhammad and Ali.Two graves in Toos: one for the best of all,And the worst man people will ever recall.No good will reach the villain (Harun ar-Rashid) who is lying nighIn grave to one whose virtues reach the sky (Imam Ridha’),Nor will the pure suffer any harmWhen near the soul that will never calm.No indeed! Every soul shall reap what it did earnSo take what you will, or leave it to burn!\"Al-Sowli narrated that Oun ibn Muhammad said that Mansoor ibn Talha recited poems that he quoted on the authority of Abu Muhammad al-Yazidi who had said, “When Ar-Ridha’ (a.s.) passed away, I recited an elegy for him as follows:What is wrong with Toos - may God not sanctify itWhich seizes a precious one each day.It began with Rashid when it grabbed him.Then it seconded it with Ar-Ridha’ Ali ibn MusaNot a regular leader was he,Rather a noble Imam - like the other ones.And the felicity of time turned into misfortunes!”I also found the following verses in Muhammad ibn Habib Dhabbi’s book:In Toos there is a tomb in which there lies an Imam DivineWhom we are enjoined to go visit his shrine.The tomb where Paradise is set up from early in the morningAnd is constantly granted greetings and peace.A tomb whose radiating rays illuminate the blindAnd its ashes treat ailments.A tomb portraying Muhammad in the eyesAnd his Trustee for by-standing believersThe eyes are humble to this allDue to the amazement in their thoughts deep withinA tomb in which those who reach at its regionTheir sins are unloaded from them when they depart.They will take with themselves an increased security from the ChastisementAnd are secured from ever suffering from poverty.God has accepted this for them on his (ar-Ridha’) behalfAnd thus the Pen is lifted off of them.If we have become needless of rain now,it is due to the clouds watering downWere it not for him, the clouds would have not poured down rain on this townThe tomb that holds Ali ibn MusaIs prouder than the land of Mecca.It is incumbent upon us to try to go visit itAs it is incumbent to respect those who reside around it.Whoever visits it recognizing his rightfulnessBy God, it is forbidden for the Fire to touch him.Surely tomorrow he shall have a praiseworthy rankWhose position will be in Gardens as the eternal abodeGod has guaranteed this for him.He has sworn to the One to Whom all pledges shall returnMay God’s Blessings be upon the Prophet MuhammadAli’s radiance and peace raised his rankMay God’s Blessings constantly be upon Az-ZahraSince the Lord knows well that she rightfully deserves it.And blessings be upon her, and then upon Al-HassanAnd upon Al-Husayn whose face shows his nobilityAnd upon Ali the virtuous and Muhammad.Blessings be upon all these Masters who are nobleand upon Ja’far - the educator and the pure-the finest blessings even though the pygmys may dislike itAnd As-Sadiq from whom we have inherited knowledgeOn which all the nations rely.Same be upon your father Musa and the ones who follow himAnd upon you be as long as Mercy lastsAnd upon the pure Muhammad - may his purity be increasedand upon Ali for as long as there is any talkingand upon Ar-Ridha’ - the son of Ar-Ridha’ - Al-Hassan whomall the towns were filled with darkness due to his demise,And blessings be upon his successor by whomthe perfect system will be completed.He is the one hoped for with whom guidance is to returnand the decrees are to be re-established.Were it not for the leaders one after the otherguidance would be extinguished - so would Islam.Each one will lead after the previous one untilthe days end with the Riser’s turnO son of the Prophet and the Proof of GodFor whom prayer and fasting has been establishedNone of you left before another one cameTo succeed him and treat the afflictions.All the same in terms of nobility and knowledgeWhether they lead in youth or old age.You are the means towards God and the firstWho know the right guidance and are its signs yourselves.You are the Masters of religion and the worldand have sanctity and protection from God.And only those who confess to your virtues are humansand those who deny are only beasts and animals.They are even more lost due to their disbeliefand their followers are subjected to arrows without heads and feathers.They benefit from your world,but are in their denial like livestock. ‏O blessings of God whom He bestows uponWhomever He chooses from amongst His creatures to bestow upon.If God hides your bodies from usHe left your spirit and order with us.Your souls are visibly availableEven after your bodies were led away from our eyes.The only difference between you and the Prophet being Prophethood,But your steps and deeds are the sameThe two tombs in Toos: in one is buried guidanceAnd a lost one in the other sees the Blazing Fire.Two tombs set side by sideOne is a Garden of Heaven in which a leader is visited,But the next one is a ditch out of Hell.In which constant thirst is generated for its corrupt resident.The nearness of the tomb of the corrupt to that of the pure oneIncreases his torture and not reduce it as he desires.Even though the two seem to be close, they are far apartand on him there are piles of torture.There comes no harm to you from the wicked one who builtThe tombs out of megaliths and marble so close by,but it kindles on him the greatest regrets,seeing that you are honored and he is damnedAnd the extent of the torture increases every hourAnd every day and every year.O if only I knew whether I shall live during the days of the RiserKilling your enemies with a sword in my hands.My two hands shall reach out to him with a burning thirst for youBut the thirst will not be quenched until I attain my goal.Of course, your tombs excite me whileOthers get excited with raised flags and tentsWho struggle to praise the affluent and the rich,While I am honored by and love reciting your praisesAnd I dedicate it (the poem) to Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’.To please him and for the intellects to get pleased with.Take it from Dhabbi - your servant whoIs insulted due to his servitude to you.If I respected the right of God upon you, it was becauseSurely there is a right for a guest upon his host even if its put off.Thus please accept from me this intention as a hostthen I will be enriched should you do soIf others have realized your love due to teaching,my love for you is due to an inspiration.",

    "englishText": "7-115 There are seven parts of the body entrusted with remembrance of God: the tongue, the soul, the spirit, the intellect, the wisdom, the head, and the heart one of which needs to persevere. The tongue’s perseverance is attained through honesty in uttering words. The soul’s perseverance is attained through presence of one’s mind. The spirit’s perseverance is attained through sincerity in repentance. The heart’s perseverance is attained through properly begging for pardon. The intellect’s perseverance is attained through properly learning from one’s mistakes. The wisdom’s perseverance is attained through proper pride, and the head’s perseverance is attained through awareness of the secrets of the world. Thus, the remembrance of God is equal to uttering praises of God for the tongue; struggling and hard work for the spirit; fear and hope for the soul; honesty and sincerity for the heart; exaltation and shyness for the intellect; submission and contentment for the wisdom; and witnessing to and approaching God for the head.\"This has been narrated by Abu Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Hamid who has linked it up to some of the good-doers - may God bless them.",

    "author": "Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq",
    "translator": "Dr. Ali Peiravi",
    "englishText": "7-59 (The compiler of the book narrated) that his father and Muhammad ibn al-Hassan - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Sa’ed ibn Abdullah quoted Ahmad ibn al-Hussein ibn Sa’id, on the authority of Ja’far ibn Muhammad al-Nowfali, on the authority of Yaqoob ibn Yazid, on the authority of Abu Abdullah Ja’far ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdullah ibn Ja’far ibn Abi Talib,on the authority of Yaqoob ibn Abdullah al-Kufy, on the authority of Musa ibn Ubaydah, on the authority of Amr ibn Abil Miqdam, on the authority of Abi Ishaq, on the authority of Al-Harith, on the authority of Muhammad ibn al-Hanifa –may God be pleased with him - and Umar ibn Abil Miqdam, on the authority of Jabir al-Jo’afy, on the authority of Abi Ja’far al-Baqir (MGB), “The head of the Jews came to Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) when he (MGB) returned from the Nahravan Battle. Ali (MGB) was sitting in the Kufa Mosque. He said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! I wish to ask you several questions regarding things which only the Prophets or their Trustees would know.’ The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! Ask whatever you want to ask.’The Jew said, ‘We have seen in our religious books that whenever the Honorable the Exalted God appoints someone as a Prophet (MGB), He orders him to choose a member of His Household as his Trustee to be in charge of the affairs of his nation after him.God tests the Prophets’ (MGB) Trustees during their life, and also tests the Trustees (MGB) after the death of the Prophets (MGB). Tell me that how many times are the Trustees tested during the Prophets’ (MGB) lifetimes, and how many times are they tested after their death. If the Trustees do well in these testes, what will be their end?’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear by the right of God who split the sea for the Israelites and sent the Torah to Moses (MGB)! Will you confirm the truth if I say it?’ The Jew replied, ‘Yes; I will.’Again Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear by the right of God who split the sea for the Israelites and sent the Torah to Moses (MGB)! Will you submit to Islam if I tell the truth?’ Again the Jew replied, ‘Yes; I will.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God would test the Trustees of the Prophets on seven occasions during the lifetimes of the Prophets in order to see their obedience. Then if God is pleased with their obedience, God will advise the Prophets to establish their Trustees as their friends during their lifetimes, and as their Trustees after their demise. God will make it necessary for all the nations who follow the Prophet to obey his Trustee as they obeyed the Prophet. Then God would test the Trustees on seven occasions after the demise of the Prophet in order to test their perseverance and tolerance. Then when God is satisfied with them, they will have a prosperous ending and will join the Prophets. Indeed they will attain perfect prosperity.’The head of the Jews said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! You are right! Please tell me how many times did God test you during the lifetime of Muhammad (MGB) and how many times will God test you after his death? What will be your ending?’Ali (MGB) extended his hand; took the Jew’s hand and said, ‘O Jewish brother! Please let’s go so that I may inform you about this subject.’ A group of Ali (MGB)’s companions ran ahead and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Please let us be with him and hear the answer.’The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘I am afraid you cannot tolerate to hear this.’ They said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful (MGB)! Why?’ He (MGB) replied, ‘Since I have seen and heard a lot about you.’ Then Malik Ashtar stepped forward and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Please also inform us of the subject. I swear to God that we believe that there is no Trustee on the Earth for the Prophet (MGB) but you. We believe that God will not send a Prophet after our Prophet. It is incumbent upon us to obey you and obeying you is connected to obeying our Prophet (MGB).’ Ali (MGB) accepted Malik Ashtar’s request. Then Ali (MGB) sat down facing the Jew and said, ‘O Jewish brother! Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God tested me on seven occasions during the lifetime of the Prophet (MGB). I say this without praising myself. God found me obeying God’s blessing.’ The Jew said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! On what occasions did God test you?’The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘The first occasion was when the Honorable the Exalted God sent down revelations to the Prophet (MGB) and appointed him as the Prophet. As the youngest man in the house, I was with him and served him by doing whatever he ordered me to do. He (MGB) proposed to all the small and old men of the Abdul Mutalib household to submit to Islam by bearing testimony that ‘There is no god but God’ and that ‘He (MGB) is the Prophet of God’. They all rejected this subject and confronted him. They cut off associating with him. They turned away from and abandoned him. Other people also abandoned him and argued with him. They considered what had been suggested to them too great, since they could not tolerate it and their minds could not understand it. I was the only man who rushed to accept him through my belief and let no doubt in my heart. We had this belief for three years. No one except the Prophet (MGB), me and Khadijah - the daughter of Khuwaylid existed on the Earth who prayed and testified to the Prophethood.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the second occasion I should say that the Quraysh always plotted and tried to find ways to kill the Prophet (MGB). Finally their decision was to take part in a consultation session in one of the homes with the presence of the damnedSatan who had participated there looking like a one-eyed man from the Al-Saqaf. They collectively voted that each sect of the Quraysh should dispatch one man as their representative. Each one should take a sword and collectively attack the Prophet (MGB) and kill him. They thought that this way each of the sects of the Quraysh would support its representative and not surrender him to be punished and thus Muhammad’s blood would be shed without any punishment for it. Then Gabriel (MGB) descended down to the Prophet (MGB) and informed him of the plot of the Quraysh and the night they plan to attack and the hour of their attack. Gabriel ordered the Prophet (MGB) to leave his house at that time and go and hide in a cave. God’s Prophet (MGB) called me in and told me the news. He (MGB) ordered me to sleep in his bed and risk my life for him. I immediately accepted this and was happy to be killed instead of him (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) went away and I slept in his bed and encountered the men of the Quraysh who thought they were going to kill the Prophet (MGB). They entered the house and I unsheathed my sword when I faced them in the house I was in, and fought them as God and the people know.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the third occasion I should say that the two sons of Rabia and the son of Ataba were from the strongest men of the Quraysh. They entered the battlefield during the Battle of Badr and challenged us, but no one from the Quraysh was able to face them. God’s Prophet (MGB) sent me and two of my friends - may God be pleased with them - to fight with them. I was the youngest of them and the least experienced one in fighting. However, the Honorable the Exalted God had Valid (Ibn Ataba) and Shayba (Ibn Rabia) killed by my hand. Moreover, I killed and captured many more of the strong men of the Quraysh. Many more than any of the other fighters were killed or captured on that day. However, my cousin Ubayda ibn Harith was martyred on that day.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then, the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fourth occasion I should say that all the people of Mecca set out to attack us. They even used all the Arab and Quraysh tribes under their influence in this attack in order to avenge for their losses in the Battle of Badr. Gabriel descended upon the Prophet (MGB) and informed him aboutthis issue. The Prophet (MGB) set out and set up his army in the valley that is in front of the mountain of Uhud. The polytheists carried out a surprise attack against us. Many Muslims were martyred and the rest fled. I remained with the Prophet (MGB) while the Emigrants (Muhajerin) and their Helpers (Ansar) returned to their homes in Medina. They all said that the Prophet (MGB) and all his companions were killed. Then the Honorable the Exalted God did not let the polytheists to success. I suffered from more than seventy injuries several of which can be seen.’ Then he pushed his cloak aside, touched his injuries and said, ‘What I did on that day is to be rewarded by the Honorable the Exalted God - if He wills.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fifth occasion I should say that the people of the Quraysh tribe and the Arabs gathered together and a covenant was established between them not to stop fighting us until they kill the Prophet (MGB) and all the Muslims of the household of Abdul Mutalib.Then they came with all their weapons and armaments and laid siege to Medina. They were sure they would win. Gabriel descended to the Prophet (MGB) and informed him (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) dug a trench around himself and those of the Emigrants (Muhajerin) and their Helpers (Ansar) who were with us. The Quraysh tribe moved forward, and settled down around the trench and surrounded us. They considered themselves to be strong and considered us to be weak. Thus, they were roaming all around. The Prophet (MGB) invited them to the Honorable the Exalted God’s religion and beseeched their ties of kinship, but they did not listen and refused his invitation. The Prophet’s invitation of them to Islam made them more vicious. On that day the strong man of the Arabs was Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd who kept yelling like a drunk camel and challenging someone to fight with him. He showed off his spears and sword but no one dared go fight him. God’s Prophet (MGB) had me stand up, wrapped his turban around my head, and handed me this sword.’ (At this time Ali (MGB) touched his sword). ‘Then I set out to fight with him. All the women in Medina were crying since they were worried about me getting killed in fighting with Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd. However, the Honorable the Exalted God had him killed by my hands. The Arabs who considered no one but him to be a strong man hit me on the head with this blow!’ (And Ali (MGB) pointed to his head). ‘God had all the Arabs and the Quraysh run away due to the blow delivered to me.’Then, Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then, the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the sixth occasion I should say that I accompanied God’s Prophet (MGB) in an attack against your brethren in the oasis of Khaybar and other strong men from the Quraysh tribe. There appeared a lot of men on horses and on foot with perfect armaments against us just like a mountain. They possessed strong forts and were superior to us both in terms of military power and their number. Each one of them attacked us and challenged someone to go fight him. All my companions who went to fight with them were killed. Gradually the war became heated; the eyes became like bowls filled up with blood and everyone thought for himself. Some of my companions looked at others and said, ‘O Abal-Hassan! O Abal-Hassan! Move!’ Then God’s Prophet (MGB) dispatched me to the front of their fort. I killed everyone who came out. I tore up all the strong men who showed up to demonstrate their physical strength. I attacked them just like a lion. Then they hid in the fort. I broke down the gate of the fort and entered the fort by myself. I killed every man who showed up, and captured every woman until I conquered the fort. There was no one but God there to assist me.’ Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the seventh occasion I should say that when God’s Prophet (MGB) decided to conquer Mecca, he (MGB) did not wish to leave any excuses for them. Therefore, he (MGB) wrote them a letter in which he (MGB) invited them towards God just as he (MGB) had done on the very first day. The Prophet (MGB) admonished them and frightened them about God’s torture. He (MGB) gave them the glad tiding of becoming forgiven and assured them of having hope for God’s forgiveness. He (MGB) wrote the Blessed Quranic Chapter of Bara’at (Declaration of Immunity) for them to be read for them at the end of the letter. He (MGB) suggested to his Companions to take the letter. Everybody refrained from doing so until someone accepted. The Prophet (MGB) sent the letter with him. Then Gabriel descended and said, ‘O Muhammad! Either you or one of the members of your household should deliver this letter.’ Then God’s Prophet (MGB) had me deliver the letter. Therefore, I went to Mecca. You all know the people of Mecca well. Each one of them was willing to spend all his wealth, family and life to tear me up into pieces and place each part of me on top of a different mountain. I delivered the letter of the Prophet (MGB)to them and read it for them. Everybody answered me by threatening me and giving me up in the air promises. All the men and the women were suspicious of me and expressed their hatred and animosity. However, I persisted as you all well know.’ Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! These were the seven occasions on which the Honorable the Exalted God tested me during the lifetime of His Prophet (MGB) and found me obedient on every occasion due to the honor which He had granted me. No one else is like me in this respect. I could praise myself for this but the Honorable the Exalted God has admonished the people against this.’Then the Jew said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! You are right! I swear by God that the Honorable the Exalted God has made you superior because you are a relative of the Prophet (MGB). God has made you prosperous because of being his brother and has credited you a position in relation to him just like that of Aaron to Moses (MGB). He has also honored you by examining you on these horrifying occasions which you mentioned on which you superseded all the other Muslims. None of the Muslims was like you on these frightening occasions in which you have participated, and you were the most virtuous one in those frightening occasions in which you participated. None of the Muslims is like you. Anyone who has seen you with the Prophet (MGB) during his lifetime or has looked at you after the death of the Prophet (MGB) has this same belief. O Commander of the Faithful! Now please tell me how you were tested after the demise of God’s Prophet and how you were patient and persevered. We more or less know the answer and can report it, but want to hear it from yourself as we heard those related to the lifetime of the Prophet (MGB).’ Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! Indeed God tested me on seven occasions after the demise of His Prophet (MGB) and found me obedient and persevering on every occasion due to the honor which He had granted me.O Jewish brother! About the first occasion I should say that in this world I had no one to associate with, be friends with, trust, rely upon or make any pledges with amongst the Muslims, but the Prophet (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) was my only shelter. He fostered me since my childhood and supported me in my adulthood. He (MGB) did not let me grow up like an orphan. He (MGB) alleviated my worries; made me needless of working to seek my share of daily bread; prevented me from engaging in business byproviding for my family and me. These were only his worldly aids to me. However, my spiritual gains and benefits from him through which I attained high ranks near the Honorable the Exalted God are much greater than this. When the Prophet (MGB) died I became so sad that I do not suppose all the mountains could withstand. All the members of my household became very impatient. They had lost their control. They could not tolerate this heavy burden of grief because it had made them impatient and put them out of their minds. They neither understood anything nor demanded anything. They could neither hear or speak. Other people were all influenced by this horrible situation. Some expressed condolences and sympathized with us, while others were impatient and mourned for us. I was the only one who did not lose my patience. I controlled myself and carried out the orders of the Prophet (MGB). I lifted his body; performed the ritual ablutions (wuzu) for the dead; performed the embalmment; shrouded the corpse; performed the prayer for the deceased; placed his body in the grave; and compiled the Quran and God’s decrees regarding the people. A lot of weeping, heart-aching mourning and the greatness of the calamity could not prevent me from performing my duty. I fulfilled my duties towards the Honorable the Exalted God and the Prophet (MGB) and completely performed whatever he (MGB) had ordered me to do. I was patient and I persevered.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the second occasion I should say that God’s Prophet (MGB) established me as his Trustee during his lifetime. He (MGB) had all the people who were present pledge allegiance to me so that they would listen to and obey my orders. He (MGB) instructed all who were present there to declare this to all who were absent. It was always me who informed all others of his commands while I was with the Prophet (MGB). It was always me who was the head of those who accompanied me when we traveled. I never considered anyone to be more deserving than me for anything during the lifetime of the Prophet (MGB) and after his demise.When God’s Prophet (MGB) became ill which finally resulted in his demise, he (MGB) ordered that an army be dispatched out of Medina under the command of Usamah ibn Zayd. He (MGB) dispatched anyone from the Quraysh; Aws and Khazraj etc. whom he thought might break their pledge of allegiance to me; anyone who might be hostile with me since I had killed their father, son, brother or a relative of theirs; the Emigrants (Muhajerin)and the Helpers (Ansar) and anyone with a weak belief along with Usamah Ibn Zayd. The Prophet (MGB) only kept a small group of sincere believers with him so that no one may say something out of hatred to me or hinder me from the Caliphate after the demise of the Prophet (MGB).The last thing which the Prophet (MGB) said regarding the management of his nation’s affairs was that the army of Usamah should be dispatched to war and no one under his command should disobey his orders. He (MGB) stressed this. However, once the Prophet (MGB) passed away, the very same men under whom the Prophet (MGB) had dispatched with Usamah left their posts; abandoned him; opposed the orders given by God’s Prophet (MGB); and ignored all the recommendations of the Prophet (MGB) about accompanying and helping Usamah’s army. They abandoned him and retreated to Medina to break their pledge of allegiance to me which they had made with the Prophet (MGB); break their pledge with the Honorable the Exalted God and the Prophet (MGB); and yell out in order to choose a leader for themselves without the participation or involvement of any of the members of the household of Abdul Mutalib. Their main goal was to break their pledge of allegiance which they had made to me. They were doing this while I was busy with the burial rites and rituals for the Prophet of God (MGB) and could not do anything else since attending to the Prophet’s corpse was more important than anything else. O Jewish brother! This act of the people abandoning me at this hard time burnt my heart the most. I was patient although I was mourning and had suffered from the great calamity of the loss of God’s Prophet (MGB) who was the only one I could trust besides God. I persevered on this occasion which happened immediately after the previous one.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the third occasion I should say that the one who sat in the Prophet’s (MGB) place was a fair man who came to see me everyday and apologized saying that he was ashamed that he had broken his allegiance to me, and had usurped my right. He respected me and asked for forgiveness. Based on this, I thought to myself that my God-given rights would be returned to me after him in a pleasant way. I thought that I should not wage a war in the new Islamic society that is still suffering from the remains of the ignorance of the past. I thought I should not argue so as to have some side with me and others oppose me, since then the quarrel may turn into a battle. A group of the special companions of the Prophet whom I knew well andare sincere believers in God, the Quran and the religion associated with me, invited me to claim my right in public and private. They were ready to sacrifice their lives so as to help me and honor their pledge of allegiance to me. I advised them to be calm and patient and that God may give back my due rights without any fighting or blood-shed. Many people started to doubt the religion after the demise of the Prophet (MGB), and many worthless greedy individuals were after the power to rule as the Caliph. Each tribe vociferously announced that the Caliph should be someone chosen from amongst them. What they all implied was that the affairs of the state must be in the hands of someone other than me.When the first Caliph (who is Abu Bakr) was about to die, he entrusted the affairs to his friend to be in charge after him. This was another hardship that pursued the previous one and usurped my God-given right to the position of Caliphate for the second time. Again some of the companions of the Prophet which are either dead or alive now gathered around me and repeated their concerns about my Caliphate. Again I invited them to patience and calmness so that the Islamic society may be protected, and the society which the Prophet (MGB) had formed with a lot of hardship not become disunited. The Prophet (MGB) had established the Islamic society with a genuine policy. He (MGB) had been easy-going at some times, and stern at other times. He (MGB) forgave sometimes and unsheathed his sword at other times. The Prophet (MGB) was very sympathetic with the people. He (MGB) fed them and pleased them just as soon as they approached Islam and were about to run away from it. He gave them clothing, carpets and beds even though we ourselves as the members of the household lived in homes without roofs and doors. The walls of our homes were made of date palm branches and leaves. We neither had any carpets or any blankets. Several of us shared one dress and took turns to pray with it. We remained hungry around the clock. The Prophet (MGB) even gave away the one-fifth levy that was our God-ordained rightful share to others and assisted the wealthy and materialist Arabs with it. I had to maintain the society which had been formed with this much hardship and could not lead it into the verge of separation and dispute. If I uprose and invited the people to help me, they had only one of two choices. They would either obey me and fight the opponents on my behalf and get killed, or abandoned me and become unbelievers for committing the sin of disobeying me. They all knew that their position relative to me is like the position of the people of Moses as opponents of Aaron. They knew that they would suffer a similar catastrophe like that which the people of Moses suffered due to their disobedience of Aaron. I thought that just being sorry and patient would increase my reward near the Honorable God until God ordains what He wills ‘…And the command of Allah is a decree determined.’ This would also be easier for the Islamic society which I described for you.O Jewish brother! It would have been right for me not to have paid attention to these points and demanded my rights. All the companions of the Prophet (MGB) including those who have now passed away and those who are present here acknowledge that my power is more than others; my tribe is nobler than all the other tribes; my followers are loftier and more obedient than others; the motivation of my followers to support me is higher and their nobilities and background are more outstanding as others as me myself have a good background of association with the Prophet (MGB), closeness to the Prophet (MGB), and I am the Trustee of the Prophet (MGB). Moreover, I deserve to be in charge of the position of the Caliphate due to the explicit will of the Prophet (MGB) and the pledge of allegiance which they had made to me. When the Prophet (MGB) passed away, the rule of the affairs was in the hands of his family - not their hands or that of their families. The members of the household of the Prophet (MGB) which had been purified by God deserved more to run the affairs of the state than others. They possessed all the necessary characteristics for the position of the Caliphate.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fourth occasion I should say that the one was put in charge after Abu Bakr consulted with me from the beginning to the end of everything he wanted to do and issued all decrees according to my opinion. He always sought my opinion regarding tough issues and acted accordingly. My companions and I do not know of anyone else whose counsel he seeks. No one but me was eager to become the Caliph after him. When he was attacked and about to die without any previous illnesses, I had no doubts that I was going to regain my right of Caliphate without any problems; that the future would be as I wished it to be; and that God would bring about a good future. However, he named six persons as candidates for the position of the Caliphate at the end, and I was named as the last one. He did not even consider me to be equal to them. He did not remember the fact that I was the Prophet’s relative and Trustee. He did not even remember that I was the Prophet’s groom. None of the candidates had the brilliant background and good service to Islam as I had. He let us consult amongst ourselves and chose one as the future Caliph with the majority vote. He ordered his son to cut off our necks if we disobeyed him or failed to choose one from amongst ourselves as the future Caliph.O Jewish brother! This was bitter enough for me! This group of candidates tried as hard as they could to deliver lectures and lobby on their own behalfwhile they could. I remained silent until they asked my opinion. I then presented my background and explained to them what they clearly knew. I proved my rightfulness and their unrightfulness for them. I reminded them of the Prophet’s will and their pledge of allegiance to me. However, their love for getting into office; ordering the people around; their attachment to this world; and following in the footsteps of the previous Caliphs led them to demand an undue right for themselves. Whenever I had a chance to be alone with any of them I reminded them of the Reckoning on the Resurrection Day, and frightened them of the result of their unjust demand. They would agree with me on the condition that I turn the Caliphate position over to them after myself. They knew well that I could not do so and act against the Quran and the decree of the Prophet (MGB), and turn over to them what God had withheld from them. Then one of the radical persons in the council made a radical move, took the affairs out of my hands, and turned the position of the Caliphate over to Uthman, although he never matched any of the members of the council since he was a wealthy and materialist person. He never paid any attention to the people’s noble character and religious beliefs. He ignored all spiritual noble characteristics for which God had honored the Prophet (MGB) and his Holy Household. I do not even think that the very same members of the council who appointed Uthman to the position of the Caliphate became sorry for their choice before the night of that very same day, and started to blame one another. No long time passed before they who had empowered the dictator denounced and abandoned him. Uthman got worried. He went to his supporters and his other companions and asked that they accept his resignation. He expressed his sorrow and repentance. O Jewish brother! This was even a harder calamity than the previous ones! I hoped it had never happened. I was under so much pressure for this event that it cannot be described in words. However, I had no choice but to be patient! On the very same day of pledging allegiance to Uthman, the members of the council came to me and apologized for having opposed me. They asked me to revolt against Uthman and put him out of office. They all pledged allegiance to me and promised that they would sacrifice their lives to achieve this end. However, I put things off whenever they came by and had them attend to something else. For example, once I asked them to go shave their heads before we revolt. At another time I asked them to arrange for a private meeting in such and such place. This way I kept them busy and divulged their secrets.’O Jewish brother! I swear to God that the very same considerations which had prevented me from doing anything in the past were again obstacles whichhindered me. I realized that isolation and patience is a more appropriate approach for me. It was better for me to maintain my supporters who agree with me than to revolt and have them get killed, although they were all ready to sacrifice their lives. I was even more ready to die since as those who are absent and those who are present all know that to me death is just like a sip of cold water in the mouth on a very hot day. My uncle Hamzih, my brother Ja’far, my cousin Ubaydah and I have made a pledge to God and His Prophet (MGB) and will honor it. Some of my companions went so far as to sacrifice their lives in this way. I was held back due to God’s will. The Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following verse about us, ‘Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah. of them some have completed their vow (to the extreme), and some (still) wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least:’ I swear by God that I am the one referred to in this verse as the one who still waits.O Jewish brother! I have not abandoned my pledge! The reason why I was silent in front of Uthman and did not do anything is that he is going to be punished by his own baseness and untrustworthiness which I found in him and this would draw the people from near and afar to want to dismiss and kill him. I just stayed on the side and waited until this happened. I neither said ‘yes’ nor did I say ‘no.’Then the nation rushed to the door of my house. God knows that I hated the Caliphate, since I knew that the very same people who insist in making me the Caliph are used to collecting worldly goods and having fun. Although they well knew that I would be hard on them and not fulfill their greediness, they had gotten used to rushing in doing things and could not be soothed. They hurriedly chose me by insisting a lot but when they realized that they could not gain anything from me they started to oppose and criticize me.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fifth occasion I should say that when the ones who pledged allegiance to me realized that I would not fulfill their personal aims, they rebelled against me with the help of that woman (i.e. Ayesha). They placed her on the back of a camel and turned her around in the frightening deserts and wide valleys even though I was in charge of her as the Trustee of the Prophet (MGB). The dogs at Huab barked at her and she felt sorry Yet she followed a group of people who had pledged allegiance to me bothat the time of the Prophet (MGB) and later on, and continued opposing me until she entered upon the people of Basra whose hands were short, their beards were long, their intellectual capacity was low, and their thoughts were corrupt. These people were light-headed desert dwellers. This woman took control of these unwise people and they unsheathed their swords, threw their spears and arrows without any knowledge. I had two problems with them. If I did nothing in response to them, they would not follow the intellect and put their rebellion and corruption aside. If I fought with them, then there would be a lot of blood shedding which I never wanted. I was both apologetic to them and gave an ultimatum by threatening them. I suggested to that woman to go home. I also suggested to the group who had brought her to honor their pledge of allegiance to me and not to break their covenant with the Honorable the Exalted God.I offered them as much as I had the power to. I even talked to some of them . He returned. I talked with others in the same way but their ignorance, rebellion and deviation became even more than before. I fought with them since they insisted on that. I defeated them in the war and they became sorry. Many of them were killed on the battlefield. I fought them since I had no other choice. Had I postponed fighting, they would have done things which would have prevented me from forgiving them as I did after the war.If I had not blocked them I would have been disloyal to myself and the nation and would have become a partner in the sins which they had decided to commit as follows:1- They had planned to extend their rebellion in the surroundings of the Islamic country to whatever extent they could and do acts of corruption.2- They had planned to kill and shed the blood of the citizens.3- They had planned to subject the rules of Islam and the laws of justice according to the opinions of a low-minded and unintelligent women and follow the old Roman nation; Yemen and destroyed nations of the past in this respect. Had I hesitated to fight, I would have ultimately been forced to fight with them and would also be ashamed of the evil deeds and crimes which that woman and her troops would have committed. Still I did not start the battle without hesitation. First, I gave them an ultimatum and postponed the war as much as possible. I was calm. I negotiated with them several times. I even sent several mediators to them. I made them several offers which were to their benefit. However, they turned me down on every occasion. They made me helpless, forced me to start a war, and end the issue as God willed. Given all that was done before the war they had been given enough ultimatum.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the sixth occasion I should say that it was the arbitration council and the Battle with the son of the liver-eater Hind (Muaviayh). This man had been an enemy of God, His Prophet (MGB), and the believers from the day on which God appointed Muhammad (MGB) to Prophethood until the city of Mecca was conquered by the force of the Muslims’ swords.Muaviayh and his father Abu Sufyan had pledged allegiance to me on that very same day and on three other occasions. His father was the first person who greeted me using the title of ‘the Commander of the Faithful.’ He was the one who constantly encouraged me to fight for my due rights and renewed his pledge of allegiance to me every time he met me.The strangest of all is that when Muawiyah realized that the Blessed the Sublime God had returned my right to me and had strengthened my position, he lost all hopes of becoming the fourth Caliph and ruling in our government. He turned to the disobedient Amr al-As and was generous with him so that he accepted his invitation. Amr became his fan when Muawiyah entrusted the governorship of Egypt to him, although it is forbidden for him to use even one Dirham of the taxes collected from Egypt as it was so for Muawiyah to give him any more than his own share. Then he rebelled and acted oppressively in the Islamic country. He was kind to anyone who swore allegiance to him and fended away anyone who opposed him.He joined the perfidious party (Nakiseen) in an attack against Islamic territories and looted the east, the west, the north and the south. I received the news and the reports of their deeds until the one-eyed Saqafy (Al-Muqayrih) proposed that I make peace with Muawiyah and appoint him to the governorship of the territories that were under his control. This opinion was a good one in terms of politics, but I could not bring any excuses for doing this in God’s presence and could not take responsibility for Muawiyah’s acts of oppression. I thought about this proposal and consulted with reliable people who were God-fearing and followed the Prophet (MGB). They had the same opinion as I did regarding the son of the liver-eater lady. May God not bring the day on which I use any of the oppressors as my aids.I once dispatched Jarir al-Bajaly and dispatched Abu Musa al-Ash’ari to him on another occasion. They both followed their worldly desires, theirtemptations, pleased him and were disloyal to me. I realized that they were not act according to God’s command and they were becoming more and more deviated and corrupt as time passed. I consulted with a group of the chosen companions of the Prophet from the Badriyeen who were honored by God and had participated in the pledge of allegiance at Rezvan and other noble Muslims. They unanimously agreed that we go to war with him and not let him take charge of the affairs of the Muslims.My companions and I set out to fight with him. We wrote him letters from every way-station. I sent him many representatives and invited him to put aside his corruption and join me and the other Muslims. He answered me with haughty letters; wished unsuitable wishes; and set conditions which were not acceptable by God, the Prophet and the Muslims.In one of his letters he made it a condition that we should surrender a group of the Prophet’s best companions to him including Ammar Yasir so that he could hang them in retaliation for the blood of Uthman. Where can you find someone like Ammar? I swear by God that he was always the sixth person present whenever five of us gathered around the Prophet (MGB). He was also the fourth person present whenever four of us gathered around the Prophet (MGB).He wanted to retaliate for the blood of Uthman even though he, his colleagues and his damned family who were branches of the Cursed Tree as mentioned in the Holy Quran made the people rebel against Uthman and caused him to be killed. He attacked me since I did not accept his unreasonable conditions and he was proud of his rebellion. He gathered a group of the Homayr tribes who had neither any intellect nor any insight in religion around himself and led them astray so as to follow him. He fooled them with worldly possessions and attracted them to himself.We set the Honorable the Exalted God as the judge and set out to fight him in order to stop him. We fought with him after giving him an ultimatum, so that he may have no excuses left. God made us victorious over His enemies and ours as usual.We were holding the flag of God’s Prophet (MGB) under which God had always killed the followers of Satan, but Muawiyah was holding the flag of his father under which his father had fought with God’s Prophet (MGB).He was about to die with no way out. He rode his horse, saw that his flag had fallen down and felt hopeless. He sought the help of Amr al-As. Amr al-As advised him to bring out many copies of the Quran, place them on top of their spears and to ask for the arbitration of the Quran. He told Muawiyah that since the son of Abu Talib, his followers and the rest of theHousehold of the Prophet (MGB) are religious and had invited you to arbitration of the Quran in the beginning, they would accept its arbitration from you at the end.Muawiyah accepted the idea proposed by Amr al-As since he was helpless and had no way out of war and getting killed. He placed many copies of the Quran on the spears and had them held up thinking that he was inviting the people to abide by the Quran. I had lost many of my good friends and sincere companions. The rest of the people were inclined to accept the Quran’s arbitration and stop the war. They thought that since the son of the liver-eater Hind (Muawiyah) is adhering to the rules of the Quran, he would honor them. They welcomed his call and all accepted his suggestion.I announced to them that this was a deception which Muawiyah had plotted using Amr al-As and that they would not adhere to it. However, they did not believe me and did not obey my orders. They insisted on accepting his suggestion. Whether I liked it or not, things became so bad that some of them said that we should kill Ali just like Uthman or turn him and his family over to Muawiyah if he doesn’t accept Muawiyah’s suggestion.God knows best that I did my best and tried as hard as I could to convince them to follow me, but they would not obey me. I even asked them to give me a little time - as much as milking a camel or running a horse so that I may complete the work. However, they did not accept it except for this man (while Ali (MGB) was pointing to Malik al-Ashtar), his followers, and a group of my own household. I swear by God that what hindered me from following my own idea was my fear of these two being killed (while Ali (MGB) was pointing to Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) with his hand), and the cessation of the lineage of God’s Prophet (MGB). It was also due to my fear of these two being killed (while Ali (MGB) was pointing to Abdullah ibn Ja’far and Muhammad ibn Hanifeh - may God be pleased with them - with his hand), since I knew that they were only endangered because of me. Therefore, I was forced to accept God’s destiny and accept the demands of the people. Once the battle was stopped and the swords were no long pointed at them, they demanded that they themselves be the arbiters instead of the Quran. They took over the rules of the Quran and put its decrees aside. I never considered anyone to be able to arbitrate on behalf of God’s religion since man’s arbitration in God’s religion is undoubtedly wrong. However, the people did not accept anything but arbitration.I wanted to have a knowledgeable person from my household or some of the other tribes who was wise, reliable and religious to arbitrate on my behalf. The son of Hind disagreed with whomever I named. He did not accept anyof my rightful proposals. He oppressed us through my own companions. When they insisted and wanted to force me to accept the arbitration, I sought refuge in the Honorable the Exalted God and left this up to themselves. Then they chose a man who was deceived by Amr As, and the world got filled with the shame of this act. They themselves became sorry about it.’ Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the seventh I should tell you that in his will to me, God’s Prophet (MGB) had informed me that I would fight with a tribe of my own companions near the end of my life, although they fast during the days, worship God at night and read the Quran but have put aside the religion by arguing and fighting with me just like an arrow which flies from a bow. Zul-Sadiyyeh is going to be amongst them. I will have a prosperous end after killing them. When I returned after the arbitration, some of the people started to blame each other as to why the Battle of Siffin ended by arbitration.They found themselves no solution but to except to criticize the leader and said, ‘Our leader should not have obeyed our wrong opinion. Since he was certain about our fault, he must kill either himself or those who were faulty. Since he obeyed us, he has become an unbeliever. Therefore, it is lawful for us to kill him and shed his blood now.’ They united concerning this issue, left my army rapidly and yelled ‘There is no arbiter but God!’Then they divided up. One group of them stayed in Nakhileh while a second group went to Hurura. Yet a third group of them went to the east beyond the Dijla river. They tired every Muslim they ran into by forcing him to deny me. If he argued with them, they would let him go. Otherwise they killed him. I went to see the first and the second groups and invited them to obey the Honorable the Exalted God, accept the truth and to return towards God. They did not accept anything but fighting with swords and they were not content with anything else. Since I found no other solution, I surrendered the first two groups to God’s decree. Therefore, I killed them. O Jewish Brother! I am so sorry about them. Had they not chosen this destructive route they would have not been killed. Then imagine how strong a castle could have been formed for Islam. However, God willed no other end but this unpleasant one for them. Then I wrote a letter to the third group and sent several delegates. The delegates were chosen ones. They were all God-fearing and ascetic. However, it was of no use. They did nothing but follow what the other two groups did. They hurriedlykilled the Muslims who did not agree with them and continuously killed good people. I attacked them myself and blocked off the Euphrates river from their access. Again I sent trustworthy delegates and advisors to them and made all attempts to accept their apologies by means of those men (while Ali (MGB) was pointing at Malik Ashtar; Al-Ahnaf ibn Qays; Sa’id ibn Qays al-Arhabi; and Al-Ash’as ibn Qays al-Kindi). O Jewish Brother! Since they accepted no solution except fighting, I fought with them until all of them were killed. O Jewish brother! They were all killed - all being more than forty-thousand of them. Not even one of them could flee. Then I pulled out the man who had breasts just like women have from amongst the dead corpses in front of these very same men that you see. He had breasts just like women do. Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the seventh. I was faithful to all seven and just one rank remains which is undoubtedly near.’ Then the companions of Ali (MGB) cried. The head of the Jews also cried and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Tell us another one!’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘And the last is that this (while referring to his head) shall become filled with the blood of this (while he was pointing to his crown)’. All of a sudden all the people in the Jamea Mosque started to cry and mourned so loudly that the people from all the houses in Kufa left their homes crying. Then the head of the Jews accepted Islam right then by the hand of the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) and lived in Medina until the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) was murdered by Ibn Muljam’s sword - may God damn Ibn Muljam.When the head of the Jews heard the news, he went to Ali’s (MGB) house and stood in front of Al-Hassan (MGB), while the people had gathered around him (MGB). They brought Ibn Muljam with his hands tied there. The head of the Jews said, ‘O Abu Muhammad! Kill him! May God kill him. I have seen in the books which were revealed to Moses (MGB) that in the sight of the Honorable the Exalted God this crime is much greater than the crime committed by Adam’s son when he killed his brother, and the crime of those who treated the she-camel of Thamud clan wrongfully.’",

بن الحنفية رضي الله عنه، وعمر بن أبي المقدام، عن جابر الجعفي، عن أبي جعفر قال: أتى رأس اليهود علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام عند منصرفة عن وقعة النهروان وهو جالس في مسجد الكوفة فقال: يا أمير المؤمنين إني اريد أن أسالك عن أشياء لا يعلمها إلا نبي أووصي نبي قال: سل عما بدالك يا أخا اليهود؟ قال: إنا نجد في الكتاب أن الله عز وجل إذا بعث نبيا أوحى إليه أن يتخذ من أهل بيته من يقوم بأمر امته من بعده وأن يعهد إليهم فيه عهدا يحتذي عليه ويعمل به في امته من بعده وأن الله عز وجل يمتحن الاوصياء في حياة الانبياء ويمتحنهم بعد وفاتهم فأخبرني كم يمتحن الله الاوصياء في حياة الانبياء؟ وكم يمتحنهم بعد وفاتهم من مرة؟ وإلى ما يصير آخر أمر الاوصياء إذا رضي محنتهم؟فقال له علي عليه السلام: والله الذي لا إله غيره، الذي فلق البحر لبني إسرائيل وأنزل التوارة على موسى عليه السلام لئن أخبرتك بحق عما تسأل عنه لتقرن به؟ قال: نعم قال: والذي فلق البحر لبني إسرائيل وأنزل التوراة على موسى عليه السلام لئن أجبتك لتسلمن؟ قال: نعم،فقال له علي عليه السلام: إن الله عز وجل يمتحن الاوصياء في حياة الانبياء في سبعة مواطن ليبتلي طاعتهم، فإذا رضي طاعتهم ومحنتهم الانبياء أن يتخذوهم أولياء في حياتهم وأوصياء بعد وفاتهم ويصير طاعة الاوصياء في أعناق الامم ممن يقول بطاعة الانبياء، ثم يمتحن الاوصياء بعدوفاة الانبياء عليهم السلام في سبعة مواطن ليبلو صبرهم، فإذا رضي محنتهم ختم لهم بالسعادة ليلحقهم بالانبياء، وقد أكمل لهم السعادة. قال له رأس اليهود: صدقت يا أميرالمؤمنين فأخبرني كم امتحنك الله في حياة محمد من مرة؟ وكم امتحنك بعد وفاته من مرة؟ وإلى ما يصير أخر أمرك؟فأخذ علي عليه السلام بيده وقال: انهض بنا انبئك بذلك فقام إليه جماعة من أصحابه. فقالوا: يا أميرالمؤمنين أنبئنا بذلك معه.، فقال: إني أخاف أن لا تحتمله قلوبكم. قالوا: ولم ذاك يا أميرالمؤمنين؟ قال: لامور بدت لي من كثير منكمفقام إليه الاشتر فقال: يا أميرالمؤمنين أنبئنا بذلك، فوالله إنا لنعلم أنه ما على ظهر الارض وصي نبي سواك، وإنا لنعلم أن الله لا يبعث بعد نبينا صلى الله عليه وآله نبيا سواه وأن طاعتك لفي أعناقنا موصولة بطاعة نبينافجلس علي عليه السلام وأقبل على اليهودي فقال: يا أخا اليهود إن الله عز وجل امتحنني في حياء نبينا محمد صلى الله عليه وآله في سبعة مواطن فوجدني فيهنمن غير تزكية لنفسي بنعمة الله له مطيعا قال: وفيم وفيم يا أميرالمؤمنين؟ قال أما أولهن فإن الله عز وجل أوحى إلى نبينا صلى الله عليه وآله وحمله الرسالة وأنا أحدث أهل بيتي سنا، أخدمه في بيته وأسعى في قضاء بين يديه في أمره، فدعا صغير بني عبدالمطلب وكبيرهم إلى شهادة أن لا إله إلا الله وأنه رسول الله فامتنعوا من ذلك وأنكروه عليه وهجروه، ونابذوه واعتزلوه واجتنبوه وسائر الناس مقصين له ومخالفين عليه، قد استعظموا ما أورده عليهم مما لم تحتمله قلوبهم وتدركه عقولهم،فأجبت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وحدي إلى مادعا إليه مسرعا مطيعا موقنا، لم يتخالجني في ذلك شك، فمكثنا بذلك ثلاث حجج وما على وجه الارض خلق يصلي أو يشهد لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بما آتاه الله غيري وغير ابنة خويلد رحمها الله وقد فعل ثم أقبل عليه السلام على أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك قالوا: بلى يا أميرالمؤمنين فقال عليه السلام: وأما الثانية يا أخا اليهود فإن قريشا لم تزل تخيل الاراء وتعمل الحيل في قتيل النبي صلى الله عليه وآله حتى كان آخرما اجتمعت في ذلك يوم الدار دار الندوة وإبليس الملعون حاضرفي صورة أعور ثقيف، فلم تزل تضرب أمرها ظهر البطن حتى اجتمعت آراؤها على أن ينتدب من كل فخذ من قريش رجل، ثم يأخذ كل رجل منهم سيفه ثم يأتي النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وهو نائم على فراشه فيضربونه جميعا بأسيافهم ضربة رجل واحد فيقتلوه، وإذا قتلوه منعت قريش رجالها ولم تسلمها فيمضي دمه هدرا، فهبط جبرئيل عيله السلام على النبي صلى الله عليه وآله فأنبأه بذلك وأخبره باليلة التي يجتمعون فيها والساعة التي يأتون فراشه فيها، وأمره بالخروج في الوقت الذي خرج فيه إلى الغار، فأخبرني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بالخبر، وأمرني أن أضطجع في مضجعه وأقيه بنفسي، فأسرعت إلى ذلك مطيعا له مسرورا لنفسي بأن اقتل دونه، فمضى عليه السلام لوجهه واضطجعت في مضجعه وأقبلت رجالات قريش موقنة في أنفسها أن تقتل النبي صلى الله عليه وآله فلما استوى بي وبهم البيت الذي أنا فيه ناهضتهم بسيفي فدفعتهم عن نفسي بما قد علمه الله والناس، ثم أقبل عليه السلام على أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين، فقال عليه السلام: وأما الثالثة يا أخا اليهود فإن ابني ربيعة وابن عتبة كانوا فرسان قريش دعوا إلى البراز يوم بدر فلم يبرزلهم خلق من قريش فأنهضني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مع صاحبي رضي الله عنهما وقد فعل وأنا أحدث أصاحبي سنا وأقلهم للحرب تجربة فقتل الله عز وجل بيدي وليدا وشبية، سوى من قتلت من جحاجحة قريش في ذلك اليوم، وسوي من أسرت، وكان مني أكثر مما كان من أصحابي واستشهد ابن عمي في ذلك رحمة الله عليه، ثم التفت إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين،فقال علي عليه السلام: وأما الرابعة يا أخا اليهود فإن أهل مكة أقبلوا ألينا على بكرة أبيهم قد استحاشوا من يليهم من قبايل العرب وقريش طالبين بثأر مشركي قريش في يوم بدر، فهبط جبرئيل عليه السلام على النبـي صـلى الله عليـه وآلـهفأنبأه بذلك، فذهب النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وعسكر بأصاحبه في سد أحد، وأقبل المشركون إلينا فحملوا ألينا حملة رجل واحد، واستشهد من المسلمين من استشهد، وكان ممن بقي من الهزيمة، وبقيت مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ومضى المهاجرون والانصار إلى منازلهم من المدينة كل يقول: قتلى النبي صلى الله عليه وآلهوقتل أصحابه ثم ضرب الله عز وجل وجوه المشركين وقد جرحت بين يدي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله نيفا وسبعين جرحة منها هذه وهذه ثم ألقى عليه السلام رداءه وأمر يده على جراحاته وكان مني في ذلك ما على الله عز وجل ثوابه إن شاء الله، ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين،فقال عليه السلام: وأما الخامسة يا أخا اليهود فإن قريشا والعرب تجمعت وعقدت بينها عقدا وميثاقا لا ترجع من وجهها حتى تقتل رسول الله وتقتلنا معه معاشر بني عبدالمطلب، ثم أقبلت بحدها وحديدها حتى أناخت عليننا بالمدينة، واثقة بأنفسها فيما توجت له فهبط جبرئيل عليه السلام على النبي صلى الله عليه وآله فأنبأه بذلك فخندق على نفسه ومن معه من المهاجرين والانصار، فقدمت قريش فأقامت على الخندق محاصرة لنا، ترى في النفسها القوة وفينا الضعف ترعد وتبرق ورسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يدعوها إلى الله عز وجل ويناشدها بالقرابة والرحم فتأبى، ولا يزيدها ذلك إلا عتوا، وفارسها وفارس العرب يومئذ عمرو بن عبدود، يهدر كالبعير المغتلم يدعو إلى البراز ويرتجز ويخطر برمحه مرة وبسيفه مرة لا يقدم عليه مقدم، ولا يطمع فيه طامع، ولا حمية تهيجه ولا بصيرة تشجعه، فأنضني إليه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وعممني بيده وأعطاني سيفه هذا، وضرب بيده إلى ذي الفقار، فخرجت إليه ونساء أهل المدينة بواك إشفاقا علي من ابن عبدود، فقتله الله عز وجل بيدي، والعرب لا تعدلها فارسا غيره، وضربني هذه الضربة وأومأ بيده إلى هامته - فهزم الله قريشا والعرب بذلك وبماكان مني فيهم من النكايةثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: وأما السادسة يا أخا اليهود فإنا وردنا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مدينة أصحابك خيبر على رجال من اليهود وفرسانها من قريش وغيرها، فتلقونا بأمثال الجبال من الخيل والرجال والسلاح، وهم في أمنع دار وأكثر عدد، كل ينادي ويدعو ويبادر إلى القتال فلم يبرز إليهم من أصحابي أحد إلا قتلوه حتى إذا احمرت الحدق، ودعيت إلى النزال وأهمت كل امرئ نفسه. والتفت بعض أصحابي إلي بعض وكل يقول: يا أبا الحسن انهض. فأنهضني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إلى دارهم فلم يبرز إلي منهم أحد إلا قتلته، ولايثبت لي فارس إلاطحنته ثم شددت عليهم شدة الليث على فريسته، حتى أدخلتهم جوف مدينتهم مسددا عليهم، فاقتلعت باب حصنهم بيدي حتى دخلت عليهم مدينتهم وحدي أقتل من يظهر فيها من رجالها، وأسبي من أجد من نسائها حتى أفتتحها وحدي، ولم يكن لي فيها معاون إلا الله وحده ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين، فقال عيه السلام: وأما السابعة يا أخااليهود فإن رسول لله صلى الله عليه وآله لما توجه لفتح مكة أحب أن يعذر إليهم ويدعوهم إلى الله عز وجل آخرا كما دعاهم أو لا فكتب إليهم كتابا يحذرهم فيه وينذرهم عذاب الله ويعدهم الصفح ويمنيهم مغفرة ربهم، ونسخ لهم في آخره سورة براءة ليقرأها عليهم، ثم عرض على جميع أصحابه المضي به فكلهم يرى التثاقل فيه، فلما رأى ذلك ندب منهم رجلا فوجهه به فأتاه جبرئيل فقال: يا محمد لا يؤدي عنك إلا أنت أو رجل منك فأنبأني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بذلك ووجهني بكتابه ورسالته إلى أهل مكة قأتيت مكة وأهلها من قد عرفتم ليس منهم أحد إلا ولو قدر أن يضع على كل جبل مني إربا لفعل، ولو أن يبذل في ذلكنفسه وأهله وولده وماله، فبلغتهم رسالة النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وقرأت عليهم كتابه، فكلهم يلقاني بالتهدد والوعيد ويبدى لي البغضاء، ويظهر الشحناء من رجالهم ونسائهم، فكان مني في ذلك ما قد رأيتم، ثم التفت إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: يا أخا اليهود هذه المواطن التي امتحنني فيه ربي عز وجل مع نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله فوجدني فيها كلها بمنه مطيعا، ليس لاحد فيها مثل الذي لي ولو شئت لو صفت ذلك ولكن الله عز وجل نهى عن التزكية. فقالوا: يا أمير المؤمنين: صدقت والله ولقد أعطاك الله عز وجل الفضيلة بالقرابة من نبينا صلى الله عيله وآله وسلم، وأسعدك بأن جعلك أخاه، تنزل منه بمنزلة هارون من موسى، وفضلك بالمواقف التي باشهرتها، والاهوال التي ركبتها، وذخر لك الذي ذكرت وأكثر منه ممالم تذكره، ومما ليس لاحد من المسلمين مثله، يقول ذلك من شهدك منا مع نبينا صلى الله عيله وآله ومن شهدك بعده، فأخبرنا يا أمير المؤمنين ما امتحنك الله عز وجل به بعد نبينا صلى الله عليه وآله فاحتملته وصبرت، فلو شئنا أن نصف ذلك لو صفناه علما منا به وظهورا منا عليه، إلا أنا نحب أن نسمع منك ذلك كما سمعنا منك ما امتحنك الله به في حياته فأطعته فيهفقال عليه السلام: يا أخا اليهود إن الله عز وجل امتحنني بعد وفاة نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله في سبعة مواطن فوجدني فيهن من غير تزكية لنفسي منه ونعمته صبوراواما أولهن يا أخا اليهود فانه لم يكن لي خاصة دون المسلمين عامة أحد آنس به أو أعتمد عليه أو أستنيم إليه أو أتقرب به غير رسول الله صلى الله علية وآله، هو رباني صغيرا وبوأني كبيرا، وكفاني العيلة، وجبرني من اليتم، وأغناني عن الطلب ووقاني المكسب. وعال لي النفس والولد والاهل هذا في تصاريف أمر الدنيامع ما خصني به من الدرجات التي قادتني إلى معالي الحق عند الله عز وجل فنزل بي من وفاة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مالم أكن أظن الجبال لو حملته عنوة كانت تنهض به فرأيت الناس من أهل بيتي ما بين جازع لا يملك جزعه، ولا بضبط نفسه، ولا يقوي على حمل فادح ما نزل به قد أذهب الجزع صبره، وأذهل عقله، وحال بينه وبين الفهم والافهام والقول والاسماع، وسائر الناس من غير بني عبدالمطلب بين معز يأمر بالصبر، وبين مساعد باك البكائهم،جازع لجزعهم، وحملت نفسي على الصبر عند وفاته بلزوم الصمت والاشتغال بما أمرنى به من تجهيزه، وتغسيله وتحنيطه وتكفينه، والصلاة عليه، ووضعه في حفرته، وجمع كتاب الله وعهده إلى خلقه، لا يشغلني عن ذلك بادر دمعة ولا هائج زفرة ولا لاذع حرقة ولا جزيل مصيبة حتى أديت في ذلك الحق الواجب لله عز وجل ولرسوله صلى الله عليه وآله علي، وبلغت منه الذي أمرني به، واحتملته صابرا محتسبا، ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: وأما الثانية يا أخا اليهود،فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أمرني في حياته على جميع امته وأخذ على جميع من حضره منهم البيعة والسمع والطاعة لامري، وأمرهم أن يبلغ الشاهد الغائب ذلك، فكنت المؤدى إليهم عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أمره إذا حضرته والامير على من حضرني منهم إذا فارقته، لا تختلج في نفسي منازعة أحد من الخلق لي في شيء من الامر في حياة النبي صلى الله عليه وآله ولا بعد وفاته، ثم أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بتوجيه الجيش الذي وجهه مع اسامة بن زيد عند الذي أحدث الله به من المرض الذي توفاه فيه، فلم يدع النبي أحدا من أفناء العرب ولا من الاوس والخزرج وغيرهم من سائر الناس ممن يخاف على نقضه ومنازعته ولا أحدا ممن يراني بعيـنالبغضاء ممن قد وترته بقتل أبيه أو أخيه أوحميمه إلا وجهه في ذلك الجيش، ولا من المهاجرين والانصار والمسلمين وغيرهم والمؤلفة قلوبهم والمنافقين، لتصفو قلوب من يبقى معي بحضرته، ولئلا يقول قائل شيئا مما أكرهه، ولا يدفعني دافع من الولاية والقيام بأمر رعيته من بعده، ثم كان آخر ما تكلم به في شيء من أمر امته أن يمضي جيش اسامة ولا يتخلف عنه أحد ممن أنهض معه، وتقدم في ذلك أشد التقدم وأوعز فيه أبلغ الايعاز وأكد فيه أكثر التأكيد فلم أشعر بعد أن قبض النبي صلى الله عليه وآله إلا برجال من بعث اسامة بن زيد وأهل عسكره قد تركوا مراكزهم، وأخلوا مواضعهم، وخالفوا أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فيما أنهضهم له وأمرهم به وتقدم إليهم من ملازمة أميرهم مقيما في عسكره، وأقبلوا يتبادرون على الخيل ركضا إلى حل عقدة عقدها الله عز وجل لي ولرسول صلى الله عليه وآله في أعناقهم فحلوها، وعهد عاهدوا الله ورسوله فنكثوه، وعقدوا لانفسهم عقدا ضجت به أصواتهم واحتصت به آراؤهم من غير مناظرة لاحد من ابني عبدالمطلب أو مشاركة في رأي أو استقالة لما في أعناقهم من بيعتى، فعلو ذلك وأنا برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مشغول وبتجهيزه عن سائر الاشياء مصدود فإنه كان أهمها وأحق ما بدئ به منها، فكان هذا يا أخا اليهود أقرح ما ورد على قلبي مع الذي أنا فيه من عظيم الرزية، وفاجع المصيبة، وفقد من لاخلف منه إلا الله تبارك وتعالى، فصبرت عليها إذا أتت بعد أختها على تقاربها وسرعة اتصالها، ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذالك؟ قالوا: بلى ياأمير المؤمنين،فقال عليه السلام وأما الثالثة يا أخا اليهود فإن القائم بعد النبي صلى الله عليه وآله كان يلقاني معتذرا في كل أيامه ويلوم غيره ما ارتكبه من أخذ حقي ونقض بيعتي وسألني تحليله، فكنت أقول: تنقضي أيامه، ثم يرجع إلي حقي الذي جعله الله لى عفوا هنيئا من غير أن أحدث في الاسلام مع حدوثه وقرب عهده بالجاهلية حدثا في طلب حقي بمنازعة لعل فلانا يقول فيها: نعم وفلانا يقول: لا، فيؤول ذلك من القول إلى الفعل وجماعة من خواص أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله أعرفهمبالنصح لله ولرسوله ولكتابه ودينه الاسلام يأتوني عودا وبدءا وعلانية وسرا فيدعوني إلى أخذ حقي، ويبذلون أنفسهم في نصرتي ليؤدوا إلى بذلك بيعتى في أعناقهم، فأقول رويدا وصبرا لعل الله يأتينى بذلك عفوا بلا منازعة ولا إراقة الدماء، فقد ارتاب كثير من الناس بعد وفاة النبي صلى الله عليه وآله، وطمع في الامر بعده من ليس له بأهل فقال كل قوم: منا أمير، وما طمع القائلون في ذلك إلا لتناول غيري الامر، فلما دنت وفاة القائم وانقضت أيامه صير الامر بعده لصاحبه، فكانت هذه اخت اختها، ومحلها مني مثل محلها وأخذامني ماجعله الله لي، فاجتمع إلى من أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله ممن مضى وممن بقي ممن أخره الله من اجتمع فقالوا لى فيها مثل الذي قالوا في اختها، فلم يعد قولي الثاني قولي الاول صبرا واحتسابا ويقينا وإشفاقا من أن تفنى عصبة تألفهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بالين مرة وبالشدة اخرى، وبالنذر مرة وبالسيف اخرى حتى لقد كان من تألفه لهم أن كان الناس في الكر والفرار والشبع والري، واللباس والوطاء والدثار ونحن أهل بيت محمد صلى الله عليه وآله لا سقوف لبيوتنا، ولا أبواب ولاستور إلا الجرائد، وما أشبهها ولا وطاء لنا ولا دثار علينا، يتدوال الثوب الواحد في الصلاة أكثرنا، ونطوي الليالي والايام عامتنا، وربما أتا نا الشئ مما أفاءه الله علينا وصيره لنا خاصة دون غير نا ونحن على ما وصفت من حالنا فيؤثر به رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أرباب النعم والاموال تألفا منه لهم، فكنت أحق من لم يفرق هذه العصبة التى ألفها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ولم يحملها على الخطة التي لاخلاص لها منها دون بلوغها أوفناء آجالها لاني لو نصبت نفسي فدعوتهم إلى نصرتي كانوا منى وفي أمري على إحدى منزلتين إما متبع مقاتل، وإما مقتول إن لم يتبع الجميع، وإما خاذل يكفر بخذلانه إن قصر في نصرتي أو أمسك عن طاعتي، وقد علم الله أني منه بمنزلة هارون من موسى، يحل به في مخالفتي والامساك عن نصرتي ما أحل قوم موسى بأنفسهم في مخالفة هارون وترك طاعته ورأيت تجرع الغصص ورد أنفاس الصعداء ولزوم الصبر حتى يفتح الله أو يقضى بما أحب أزيدلي في حظي وأرفق بالعصابة التي وصفت أمرهم \"وَكَانَ أَمْرُ اللهِ قَدَراً مَقْدُوراً .\"ولو لم أتق هذه الحالة يا أخا اليهود - ثم طلبت حقي لكنت أولى ممن طلبه لعلم من مضى من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ومن بحضرتك منه بأني كنت أكثر عددا وأعز عشيرة وأمنع رجالا وأطوع أمرا وأوضح حجة وأكثر في هذا الدين مناقب وآثارا لسوابقي وقرابتي ووراثتي فضلا عن استحقاقي ذلك بالوصية التي لا مخرج للعباد منها والبيعة المتعدمة في أعناقهم ممن تناولها، وقد قبض محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وإن ولاية الامة في يده وفي بيته، لا في يد الاولى تناولوها ولا في بيوتهم، ولاهل بيته الذين أذهب الله عنهم الرجس وطهرهم تطهيرا أولى بالامر من بعده من غيرهم في جميع الخصال ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ فقالو: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين. فقال عليه السلام: وأما الرابعة يا أخا اليهود فإن القائم بعد صاحبه كان يشاورني في موارد الامور فيصدرها عن أمري ويناظرني في غوامضها فيمضيها عن رأيي، أعلم أحدا ولايعلمه أصحابي يناظره في ذلك غيري، ولا يطمع في الامر بعده سواي، فلما (أن) أتته منيته على فجأة بلامرض كان قبله ولا أمر كان أمضاه في صحته من بدنه لم أشك أني قد استرجعت حقي في عافية بالمنزلة التى كنت أطلبها، والعاقبة التي كنت ألتمسها وإن الله سيأتي بذلك على أحسن مارجوت، وأفضل ما أملت، وكان من فعله أن ختم أمره بأن سمى قوما أنا سادسهم، ولم يستوني بواحد منهم، ولا ذكرلي حالا في وراثة الرسول ولا قرابة ولاصهر ولانسب، ولا لواحد منهم مثل سابقة من سوابقي ولاأثر من آثارى، وصير هاشورى بيننا وصير ابنه فيها حاكما علينا وأمره أن يضرب أعناق النفر الستة الذين صير الامر فيهم إن لم ينفذوا أمره، وكفى بالصبر على هذا يا أخا اليهود صبرا وبسط الايدي والالسن في الامر والنهي والركون إلى الدنيا والاقتداء بالماضين قبلهم إلى تناول ما لم يجعلالله لهم، فمكث القوم أيامهم كلها كل يخطب لنفسه وأنا ممسك عن أن سألوني عن أمري فناظرتهم في أيامي وأيامهم وآثارى وآثارهم، وأوضحت لهم مالم يجهلوه من وجوه استحقاقي لها دونهم وذكر تهم عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إليهم وتأكيد ما أكده من البيعة لى في أعناقهم، دعاهم حب الامارة فاذا خلوت بالواحد ذكرته أيام الله وحذرته ما هوقادم عليه وصائر إليه، التمس مني شرطا أن اصيرهاله بعدي فلما لم يجدوا عندي إلا المحجة البيضاء، والحمل على كتاب الله عز وجل ووصية الرسول وإعطاء كل امرئ منهم ماجعله الله له، ومنعه مالم يجعل الله له أزالها عني إلى ابن عفان طمعا في الشحيح معه فيها، وابن عفان رجل لم يستوبه وبواحد ممن حضره حال قط فضلا عمن دونهم لاببدر التى هى سنام فخرهم ولا غيرها من المآثر التي أكرم الله بها رسوله ومن اختصه معه من أهل بيته عليه السلام ثم لم أعلم القوم أمسوا من يومهم ذلك حتى ظهرت ندامتهم ونكصوا على أعقابهم وأحال بعضهم على بعض، كل يلوم نفسه ويلوم أصحابه، ثم لم تطل الايام بالمستبد بالامر ابن عفان حتى أكفروه وتبرؤو امنه مشى إلى أصحابه خاصة وسائر أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله عامة يستقيلهم من بيعته ويتوب إلى الله من فلتته، فكانت هذه ياأخا اليهود أكبر من اختها وأفظع وأحرى أن لا يصبر عليها، فنالني منها الذي لا يبلغ وصفه ولا يحد وقته، ولم يكن عندي فيها إلا الصبر على ما أمض وأبلغ منها، ولقد أتاني الباقون من الستة من يومهم كل راجع عما كان ركب مني يسألني خلع ابن عفان والوثوب عليه وأخذ حقي ويؤتيني صفقته وبيعته على الموت تحت رايتي أويرد الله عز وجل على حقي، فوالله يا أخا اليهود ما منعني منا إلا الذي منعني من اختيها قبلها، ورأيت الابقاء على من بقي من الطائفة أبهج لي وآنس لقلبي من فنائها، وعلمت أني إن حـملتها عـلىدعوة الموت ركبتة، فأما نفسي فقد علم من حضر ممن ترى ومن غاب من أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله أن الموت عندي بمنزلة الشربة الباردة في اليوم الشديد الحر من ذي العطش الصدى،ولقد كنت عاهدت الله عز وجل ورسوله صلى الله عليه وآله أنا وعمي حمزة وأخي جعفر، وابن عمي عبيدة على أمر وفينا به لله عز وجل ولرسوله، فتقد مني أصحابي وتخلفت بعدهم لما أراد الله عز وجل فأنزل الله فينا \"مِنْ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ قَضَى نَحْبَهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَنْتَظِرُ وَمَا بَدَّلُوا تَبْدِيلاً.\" وأنا والله والمنتظريا أخا اليهود، وما بدلت تبديلا، وما سكتني عن ابن عفان وحثني على الامساك عنه إلا أني عرفت من أخلاقه فيما اختبرت منه بمالن يدعة حتى يستدعي الاباعد إلى قتله وخلعه فضلا عن الاقارب وأنا في عزلة، فصبرت حتى كان ذلك، لم أنطلق فيه بحرف من \"لا\"، ولا \"نعم \".ثم أتاني القوم وأن اعلم الله كاره لمعرفتي بما تطاعموا به من اعتقال الامول والمرح في الارض وعلمهم بأن تلك ليست لهم عندي وشديد عادة منتزعة فلما لم يجدوا عندي تعللوا الاعاليلثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ فقالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: وأما الخامسة يا أخا اليهود فإن المتابعين لي لما لم يطمعوا في تلك مني وثبوا بالمرأة على وأنا ولي أمرها، والوصي عليها، فحملوها على الجمل وشدوها على الرحال، وأقبلوا بها تخبط الفيافي وتقطع البراري وتنبح عليها كلاب الحوأب، وتظهر لهم علامات الندم في كل ساعة وعند كل حال في عصبة قد بايعوني ثانية بعد بيعتهم الاولى في حيـاة النبـي صلى الله عليه وآله حتى أتت أهلبلدة قصيرة أيديهم، طويلة لحاهم، قليلة عقولهم عازبة آراؤهم، وهم جيران بدو ووراد بحر، فأخرجتهم يخبطون بسيوفهم من غير علم، ويرمون بسهامهم بغير فهم، فوقت من أمرهم على اثنتين كلتاهما في محلة المكروه ممن إن كففت لم يرجع ولم يعقل، وإن أقمت كنت قد صرت إلى التي كرهت فقدمت الحجة بالاعذار والانذار، ودعوت المرأة إلى الرجوع إلى بينها، والقوم الذين حملوها على الوفاء ببيعتهم لي، والترك لنقضهم عهدالله عز وجل في، وأعطيتهم من نفسي كل الذي قدرت عليه، وناظرت بعضهم فرجع وذكرت فذكر، ثم أقبلت على الناس بمثل ذلك فلم يزدادوا إلا جهلا وتماديا وغيا، فلما أبوا إلا هي، ركبتها منه فكانت عليهم الدبرة، وبهم الهزيمة، ولهم الحسرة، وفيهم الفناء والقتل، وحملت نفسي على التي لم أجد منها بدا،ولم يسعني إذ فعلت ذلك وأظهرته آخرا مثل الذي وسعني منه أولا من الاغضاء والامساك ورأيتني إن أمسكت كنت معينا لهم علي بامساكي على ماصاروا إليه وطمعوا فيه من تناول الاطراف، وسفك الدماء وقتل الرعية وتحكيم النساء النواقص العقول والحظوظ على كل حال، كعادة بنى الاصفر ومن مضى من ملوك سبأ والامم الخالية فأصير إلى ما كرهت أولا وآخرا، وقد أهملت المرأة وجندها يفعلون ما وصفت بين الفريقين من الناس، ولم أهجم على الامر إلا بعدما قدمت وأخرت، وتأنيت وراجعت، وأرسلت وسافرت، وأعذرت وأنذرت وأعطيت القوم كل شيء يلتمسوه بعد أن عرضت عليهم كل شيء لم يلتمسوه، فلما أبوا إلا تلك، أقدمت عليها، فبلغ الله بي وبهم ما أراد، وكان لي عليهم بما كان مني إليهم شهيداثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: وأما السادسة يا أخا اليهود فتحكيمهم [الحكمين] ومحاربة ابن آكلة الاكباد وهو طليق معاند لله عز وجل ولرسوله والمؤمنين منذ بعث الله محمدا إلى أن فتح الله عليه مكة عنوةفاخذت بيعته وبيعة أبيه لي معه في ذلك اليوم وفي ثلاثة مواطن بعده، وأبوه بالامس أؤل من سلم على بإمرة المؤمنين، وجعل يحثني على النهوض في أخذ حقي من الماضين قبلى، ويجد دلي وبيعته كلما أتانيوأعجب العجب أنه لما رأى ربي تبارك وتعالى قد رد إليّ حقي وأقرفي معدنه، وانقطع طمعه أن يصير في دين الله رابعا وفي أمانة حملناها حكاما، كرا على العاصي ابن العاص فاستما له فمال إليه، ثم أقبل به بعد أن أطمعه مصر، وحرام عليه أن يأخذ من الفيء دون قمسه درهما، وحرام والانباء تأتيني والاخبار ترد علي بذلك، فأتاني أعور ثقيف فأشار علي أن أولي الراعي إيصال درهم إليه فوق حقه، فأقيل يخبط البلاد بالظلم ويطأها بالغشم، فمن بايعه أرضاه، ومن خالفه ناواه، ثم توجه إلي ناكثا علينا مغيرا في البلاد شرقا وغربا ويمينا وشمالا، ، والانباء تأتيني والاخبار ترد علي بذلك ، فأتاني أعور ثقيف فأشار علي أن اوليه البلاد التي هوبها لاداريه بما اوليه منها وفي الذي أشار به الراي في أمر الدنيا لو وجدت عند الله عز وجل في توليته لي مخرجا، وأصبت لنفسي في ذلك عذرا، فأعلمت الرأي في ذلك، وشاورت من أثق بنصيحته لله عز وجل ولرسوله صلى الله عليه وآله ولي وللمؤمنين فان رأيه في ابن آكلة الاكباد كرأيي، ينهاني عن توليته ويحذرني أن ادخل في أمر المسلمين يده، ولم يكن الله ليراني أتخذ المضلين عضدافوجهت إليه أخا بجيلة مرة وأخا الاشعريين مرة كلاهما ركن إلى الدنيا وتابع هواه فيما أرضاه، فلما لم أراه [أن] يزداد فيما انتهك من محارم الله ألا تماديا شـــاورتمن معي من أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله البدريين والذين ارتضى الله عز وجل أمرهم ورضي عنهم بعد بيعتهم، وغيرهم من صلحاء المسلمين والتابعين فكل يوافق رأيه رأيي في غزوه ومحاربته ومنعه مما نالت يده، وإني نهضت إليه بأصحابى، أنفذ إليه من كل موضع كتبى وأوجه إليه رسلي أدعوه إلى الرجوع عما فو فيه، والدخول فيما فيه الناس معي، فكتب يتحكم علي ويتمنى علي الاماني ويشترط علي شروطا لا يرضاها الله عز وجل ورسوله ولا المسلمون، ويشترط في بعضها أن أدفع إليه أقواما من أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله أبرارا، فيهم عمار بن ياسر، وأين مثل عمار؟ والله لقد رأيتنا مع النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وما يعد منا خمسة إلا كان سادسهم، ولا أربعة إلا كان خامسهم، اشترط دفعهم إليه ليقتلهم ويصلبهم وانتحل دم عثمان، ولعمرد الله ما ألب على عثمان ولا جمع الناس على قتله إلا هو وأشباهه من أهل بيته أغصان الشجرة الملعونة في القرآن، فلما لم اجب إلى ما اشترط من ذلك كر مستعليا في نفسه بطغيانه وبغيه بحمير لاعقول لهم ولا بصائر، فموه لهم أمرا فاتبعوه، وأعطاهم من الدنيا ما أمالهم به إليه، فناجزناهم وحاكمناهم إلى الله عز وجل بعد الاعذار والانذار فلما لم يزده ذلك إلا تماديا وبغيا لقيناه بعادة الله التي عودناه من النصر على أعدائه وعدونا، وراية رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بأيدنا، لم يزل الله تبارك وتعالى يفل حزب الشيطان بهاحتى يقضي الموت عليه، وهو معلم رايات أبيه التى لم أزل أقاتلها مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في كل المواطن، فلم يجدمن الموت منجى إلا الهرب فركب فرسه وقلب رايته، لا يدري كيف يحتال فاستعان برأي ابن العاص فأشار عليه بإظهار المصاحف ورفعها علي الاعلام والدعاء إلى ما فيها وقال: إن ابن أبيطالب وحزبه أهل بصائر ورحمة وتقيا وقد دعوك إلى كتاب الله أولا وهم مجيبوك إليه آخرا فأطاعه فيما أشاربه عليه إذا رأى أنه لا منجى له من القتل أو الهرب غيره، فرفع المصاحف يدعو إلى ما فيها بزعمه، فمالت إلى المصاحف قلوب ومن بقي من أصحابي بعدفناء أخيارهم وجهدهم في جها أعداء الله وأعدائهم على بصائر هم وظنوا أن ابن آكلة الاكباد له الوفاء بما دعا إليه، فأصغوا إلى دعوته وأقبلوا بأجمعهم في إجابته فأعلمتهم أن ذلك منه مكرو من ابن العاص معه وأنهما إلى النكث أقرب منهما إلى الوفاء، فلم يقبلوا قولي ولم يطيعوا أمري، وأبوا إلا أجابته كرهت أم هويت، شئت أو أبيت حى أخذ بعضهم يقول لبعض: إن لم يفعل فألحقوه بان عفان أو ادفعوه إلى ابن هند برمته. فجهد تعلم الله جهدي ولم أدع غلة في نفسى إلا بلغتها في أن يخلوني ورأيى فلم يفعلوا، وراودتهم على الصبر على مقدار فواق الناقة أو ركضة الفرس فلم يجيبوا ما خلاهذا الشيخ (وأو مأبيده إلى الاشتر) وعصبة من أهل بيتي، فوالله ما منعني أن أمضي على بصيرتي إلا مخافة أن يقتل هذان وأومأ بيده إلى الحسن والحسين عليه السلام - فينقطع نسل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وذريته من أمته ومخافة أن يقتل هذا وهذا وأومأ بيده إلى عبد الله بن جعفر ومحمد بن الحنفية رضي الله عنهما فإني أعلم لو لا مكاني لم يقفا ذلك الموقف فلذلك صبرع على ما أراد القوم مع ما سبق فيه من علم الله عز وجل فلما رفعنا عن القوم سيوفنا تحكموا في الامور وتخيروا الاحكام والآراء وتركوا المصاحف وما دعوا إليه من حكم القرآن، وما كنت أحكم في دين الله أحدا إذا كان التحكيم في ذلك الخطأ الذي لا شك فيه ولا امتراء، فلما أبوا إلا ذلك أردت أن احكم رجلا من أهل بيتي أو رجلا ممن أرضي رأية وعقله وأثق بنصيحته ومودته ودينهوأقبلت لا اسمي أحذا إلا امتنع منه ابن هند ولا أدعوه إلى شيء من الحق إلا أدبر عنه، وأقبل ابن هند يسومنا عسفا، وما ذاك إلا باتباع أصحابي له على ذلك فلمـاأبوا إلا غلبتي على التحكم تبرأت إلى الله عز وجل منهم وفوضت ذلك إليهم فقلدوه امرءا فخدعه ابن العاص خديعة ظهرت في شرق الارض وغربها، وأظهر المخدوع عليها ندماثم أقبل عليه السلام على أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك قالوا: بلى يا أميرالمؤمنينفقال عليه السلام وأما السابعة يا أخا اليهود فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كان عهد إلى أن أقاتل في آخر الزمان من أيامي قوما من أصحابي يصومون النهار ويقومون الليل ويتلون الكتاب، يمرقون بخلافهم علي ومحاربتهم إياي من الدين مروق السهم من الرمية، فيهم ذوالثدية يختم لى بقتلهم بالسعادة فلما انصرفت إلى موضعي هذا يعني بعد الحكمين أقبل بعض القوم على بعض باللائمة فيما صاروا إليه من تحكيم الحكمين، فلم يجدوا لانفسهم من ذلك مخرجا إلا أن قالوا: كان ينبغي لاميرنا أن لا يبايع من أخطأ وأن يقضى بحقيقة رأيه على قتل نفسه وقتل من خالفه منا فقد كفر بمتابعته إيانا وطاعته لنا في الخطأ، وأحل لنا بذلك قتله وسفك دمه، فتجمعوا على ذلك وخرجوا راكبين رؤوسهم ينادون بأعلى أصواتهم: لا حكم إلا لله،ثم تفرقوا فرقة بالنخيلة واخرى بحروراء واخرى راكبة رأسها تخبط الارض شرقاحتى عبرت دجلة، فلم تمر بمسلم إلا امتحنته، فمن تابعها استحيته، ومن خالفها قتلته، فخرجت إلى الاوليين واحدة بعد اخرى أدعوهم إلى طاعه الله عز وجل ومتابعه الحق والرجوع إليه فأبيا إلا السيف لا يقنعهما غير ذلك، فلما أعيت الحيلة فيهما حاكمتهما إلى الله عز وجل فقتل الله هذه وهذه وكانوا - يا أخا اليهود لولا مافعلوا لكانوا ركنا قويا وسدا منيعا، فأبى الله إلا ما صاروا إليه، ثم كتبت إلى الفرقة الثالثة ووجهت رسلي تتـرى وكـانوا مـنجلة أصحابي وأهل التعبد منهم والزهد في الدنيا فأبت إلا اتباع اختيها والاحتذاء على مثالهما وأسرعت في قتل من خالفهامن المسلمين وتتابعت إلى الاخبار بفعلهم، فخرجت حتى قطعت إليهم دجلة، أوجه السفراء والنصحاء وأطلب العتبي بجهدي بهذا مرة وبهذا مرة أو مأبيده إلى الاشتر، والاحنف بن قيس، وسعيد بن قيس الارحبي والاشعث بن قيس الكندي فلما أبوا إلا تلك ركبتها منهم فقتلهم الله يا أخا اليهودعن آخرهم، وهم أربعة آلاف أو يزيدون حتى لم يفلت منهم مخبر، فاستخرجت ذا الندية من قتلاهم بحضرة من ترى، له ثدي كثدي المرأة ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال، أليس كذلك؟ قالوا، بلى يا أمير المؤمين، فقال عليه السلام: قد وفيت سبعا وسبعا يا أخا اليهود، وبقيت الاخرى وأوشك بهافكان قد. فبكى أصحاب علي عليه السلام وبكى رأس اليهود وقالوا: يا أمير المؤنين أخبرنا بالاخرى فقال: الاخرى أن تخضب هذه وأو مأبيده إلى لحيتهمن هذه أو مأبيده إلى هامته، قال: وارتفعت أصوات الناس في المسجد الجامع بالضجة والبكاء حتى ليم يبق بالكوفة دار إلاخرج أهلها فزعا، وأسلم رأس اليهود على يدي علي عليه السلام من ساعته ولم يزل مقيما حتى قتل أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام وأخذ ابن ملجم لعنه الله فأقبل رأس اليهود حتى وقف على الحسن عليه السلام والناس حوله وابن ملجم لعنه الله بين يديه فقال له: يا أبا محمد اقتله قتله الله، فإني رأيت في الكتب التي انزلت على موسى عليه السلام أن هذا أعظم عند الله عز وجل جرما من ابن آدم قاتل أخيه ومن القدار عاقر ناقة ثمود",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "7-59 (The compiler of the book narrated) that his father and Muhammad ibn al-Hassan - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Sa’ed ibn Abdullah quoted Ahmad ibn al-Hussein ibn Sa’id, on the authority of Ja’far ibn Muhammad al-Nowfali, on the authority of Yaqoob ibn Yazid, on the authority of Abu Abdullah Ja’far ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdullah ibn Ja’far ibn Abi Talib,on the authority of Yaqoob ibn Abdullah al-Kufy, on the authority of Musa ibn Ubaydah, on the authority of Amr ibn Abil Miqdam, on the authority of Abi Ishaq, on the authority of Al-Harith, on the authority of Muhammad ibn al-Hanifa –may God be pleased with him - and Umar ibn Abil Miqdam, on the authority of Jabir al-Jo’afy, on the authority of Abi Ja’far al-Baqir (MGB), ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "“The head of the Jews came to Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) when he (MGB) returned from the Nahravan Battle. Ali (MGB) was sitting in the Kufa Mosque. He said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! I wish to ask you several questions regarding things which only the Prophets or their Trustees would know.’ The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! Ask whatever you want to ask.’The Jew said, ‘We have seen in our religious books that whenever the Honorable the Exalted God appoints someone as a Prophet (MGB), He orders him to choose a member of His Household as his Trustee to be in charge of the affairs of his nation after him.God tests the Prophets’ (MGB) Trustees during their life, and also tests the Trustees (MGB) after the death of the Prophets (MGB). Tell me that how many times are the Trustees tested during the Prophets’ (MGB) lifetimes, and how many times are they tested after their death. If the Trustees do well in these testes, what will be their end?’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear by the right of God who split the sea for the Israelites and sent the Torah to Moses (MGB)! Will you confirm the truth if I say it?’ The Jew replied, ‘Yes; I will.’Again Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear by the right of God who split the sea for the Israelites and sent the Torah to Moses (MGB)! Will you submit to Islam if I tell the truth?’ Again the Jew replied, ‘Yes; I will.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God would test the Trustees of the Prophets on seven occasions during the lifetimes of the Prophets in order to see their obedience. Then if God is pleased with their obedience, God will advise the Prophets to establish their Trustees as their friends during their lifetimes, and as their Trustees after their demise. God will make it necessary for all the nations who follow the Prophet to obey his Trustee as they obeyed the Prophet. Then God would test the Trustees on seven occasions after the demise of the Prophet in order to test their perseverance and tolerance. Then when God is satisfied with them, they will have a prosperous ending and will join the Prophets. Indeed they will attain perfect prosperity.’The head of the Jews said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! You are right! Please tell me how many times did God test you during the lifetime of Muhammad (MGB) and how many times will God test you after his death? What will be your ending?’Ali (MGB) extended his hand; took the Jew’s hand and said, ‘O Jewish brother! Please let’s go so that I may inform you about this subject.’ A group of Ali (MGB)’s companions ran ahead and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Please let us be with him and hear the answer.’The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘I am afraid you cannot tolerate to hear this.’ They said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful (MGB)! Why?’ He (MGB) replied, ‘Since I have seen and heard a lot about you.’ Then Malik Ashtar stepped forward and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Please also inform us of the subject. I swear to God that we believe that there is no Trustee on the Earth for the Prophet (MGB) but you. We believe that God will not send a Prophet after our Prophet. It is incumbent upon us to obey you and obeying you is connected to obeying our Prophet (MGB).’ Ali (MGB) accepted Malik Ashtar’s request. Then Ali (MGB) sat down facing the Jew and said, ‘O Jewish brother! Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God tested me on seven occasions during the lifetime of the Prophet (MGB). I say this without praising myself. God found me obeying God’s blessing.’ The Jew said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! On what occasions did God test you?’The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘The first occasion was when the Honorable the Exalted God sent down revelations to the Prophet (MGB) and appointed him as the Prophet. As the youngest man in the house, I was with him and served him by doing whatever he ordered me to do. He (MGB) proposed to all the small and old men of the Abdul Mutalib household to submit to Islam by bearing testimony that ‘There is no god but God’ and that ‘He (MGB) is the Prophet of God’. They all rejected this subject and confronted him. They cut off associating with him. They turned away from and abandoned him. Other people also abandoned him and argued with him. They considered what had been suggested to them too great, since they could not tolerate it and their minds could not understand it. I was the only man who rushed to accept him through my belief and let no doubt in my heart. We had this belief for three years. No one except the Prophet (MGB), me and Khadijah - the daughter of Khuwaylid existed on the Earth who prayed and testified to the Prophethood.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the second occasion I should say that the Quraysh always plotted and tried to find ways to kill the Prophet (MGB). Finally their decision was to take part in a consultation session in one of the homes with the presence of the damnedSatan who had participated there looking like a one-eyed man from the Al-Saqaf. They collectively voted that each sect of the Quraysh should dispatch one man as their representative. Each one should take a sword and collectively attack the Prophet (MGB) and kill him. They thought that this way each of the sects of the Quraysh would support its representative and not surrender him to be punished and thus Muhammad’s blood would be shed without any punishment for it. Then Gabriel (MGB) descended down to the Prophet (MGB) and informed him of the plot of the Quraysh and the night they plan to attack and the hour of their attack. Gabriel ordered the Prophet (MGB) to leave his house at that time and go and hide in a cave. God’s Prophet (MGB) called me in and told me the news. He (MGB) ordered me to sleep in his bed and risk my life for him. I immediately accepted this and was happy to be killed instead of him (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) went away and I slept in his bed and encountered the men of the Quraysh who thought they were going to kill the Prophet (MGB). They entered the house and I unsheathed my sword when I faced them in the house I was in, and fought them as God and the people know.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the third occasion I should say that the two sons of Rabia and the son of Ataba were from the strongest men of the Quraysh. They entered the battlefield during the Battle of Badr and challenged us, but no one from the Quraysh was able to face them. God’s Prophet (MGB) sent me and two of my friends - may God be pleased with them - to fight with them. I was the youngest of them and the least experienced one in fighting. However, the Honorable the Exalted God had Valid (Ibn Ataba) and Shayba (Ibn Rabia) killed by my hand. Moreover, I killed and captured many more of the strong men of the Quraysh. Many more than any of the other fighters were killed or captured on that day. However, my cousin Ubayda ibn Harith was martyred on that day.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then, the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fourth occasion I should say that all the people of Mecca set out to attack us. They even used all the Arab and Quraysh tribes under their influence in this attack in order to avenge for their losses in the Battle of Badr. Gabriel descended upon the Prophet (MGB) and informed him aboutthis issue. The Prophet (MGB) set out and set up his army in the valley that is in front of the mountain of Uhud. The polytheists carried out a surprise attack against us. Many Muslims were martyred and the rest fled. I remained with the Prophet (MGB) while the Emigrants (Muhajerin) and their Helpers (Ansar) returned to their homes in Medina. They all said that the Prophet (MGB) and all his companions were killed. Then the Honorable the Exalted God did not let the polytheists to success. I suffered from more than seventy injuries several of which can be seen.’ Then he pushed his cloak aside, touched his injuries and said, ‘What I did on that day is to be rewarded by the Honorable the Exalted God - if He wills.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fifth occasion I should say that the people of the Quraysh tribe and the Arabs gathered together and a covenant was established between them not to stop fighting us until they kill the Prophet (MGB) and all the Muslims of the household of Abdul Mutalib.Then they came with all their weapons and armaments and laid siege to Medina. They were sure they would win. Gabriel descended to the Prophet (MGB) and informed him (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) dug a trench around himself and those of the Emigrants (Muhajerin) and their Helpers (Ansar) who were with us. The Quraysh tribe moved forward, and settled down around the trench and surrounded us. They considered themselves to be strong and considered us to be weak. Thus, they were roaming all around. The Prophet (MGB) invited them to the Honorable the Exalted God’s religion and beseeched their ties of kinship, but they did not listen and refused his invitation. The Prophet’s invitation of them to Islam made them more vicious. On that day the strong man of the Arabs was Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd who kept yelling like a drunk camel and challenging someone to fight with him. He showed off his spears and sword but no one dared go fight him. God’s Prophet (MGB) had me stand up, wrapped his turban around my head, and handed me this sword.’ (At this time Ali (MGB) touched his sword). ‘Then I set out to fight with him. All the women in Medina were crying since they were worried about me getting killed in fighting with Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd. However, the Honorable the Exalted God had him killed by my hands. The Arabs who considered no one but him to be a strong man hit me on the head with this blow!’ (And Ali (MGB) pointed to his head). ‘God had all the Arabs and the Quraysh run away due to the blow delivered to me.’Then, Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then, the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the sixth occasion I should say that I accompanied God’s Prophet (MGB) in an attack against your brethren in the oasis of Khaybar and other strong men from the Quraysh tribe. There appeared a lot of men on horses and on foot with perfect armaments against us just like a mountain. They possessed strong forts and were superior to us both in terms of military power and their number. Each one of them attacked us and challenged someone to go fight him. All my companions who went to fight with them were killed. Gradually the war became heated; the eyes became like bowls filled up with blood and everyone thought for himself. Some of my companions looked at others and said, ‘O Abal-Hassan! O Abal-Hassan! Move!’ Then God’s Prophet (MGB) dispatched me to the front of their fort. I killed everyone who came out. I tore up all the strong men who showed up to demonstrate their physical strength. I attacked them just like a lion. Then they hid in the fort. I broke down the gate of the fort and entered the fort by myself. I killed every man who showed up, and captured every woman until I conquered the fort. There was no one but God there to assist me.’ Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the seventh occasion I should say that when God’s Prophet (MGB) decided to conquer Mecca, he (MGB) did not wish to leave any excuses for them. Therefore, he (MGB) wrote them a letter in which he (MGB) invited them towards God just as he (MGB) had done on the very first day. The Prophet (MGB) admonished them and frightened them about God’s torture. He (MGB) gave them the glad tiding of becoming forgiven and assured them of having hope for God’s forgiveness. He (MGB) wrote the Blessed Quranic Chapter of Bara’at (Declaration of Immunity) for them to be read for them at the end of the letter. He (MGB) suggested to his Companions to take the letter. Everybody refrained from doing so until someone accepted. The Prophet (MGB) sent the letter with him. Then Gabriel descended and said, ‘O Muhammad! Either you or one of the members of your household should deliver this letter.’ Then God’s Prophet (MGB) had me deliver the letter. Therefore, I went to Mecca. You all know the people of Mecca well. Each one of them was willing to spend all his wealth, family and life to tear me up into pieces and place each part of me on top of a different mountain. I delivered the letter of the Prophet (MGB)to them and read it for them. Everybody answered me by threatening me and giving me up in the air promises. All the men and the women were suspicious of me and expressed their hatred and animosity. However, I persisted as you all well know.’ Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! These were the seven occasions on which the Honorable the Exalted God tested me during the lifetime of His Prophet (MGB) and found me obedient on every occasion due to the honor which He had granted me. No one else is like me in this respect. I could praise myself for this but the Honorable the Exalted God has admonished the people against this.’Then the Jew said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! You are right! I swear by God that the Honorable the Exalted God has made you superior because you are a relative of the Prophet (MGB). God has made you prosperous because of being his brother and has credited you a position in relation to him just like that of Aaron to Moses (MGB). He has also honored you by examining you on these horrifying occasions which you mentioned on which you superseded all the other Muslims. None of the Muslims was like you on these frightening occasions in which you have participated, and you were the most virtuous one in those frightening occasions in which you participated. None of the Muslims is like you. Anyone who has seen you with the Prophet (MGB) during his lifetime or has looked at you after the death of the Prophet (MGB) has this same belief. O Commander of the Faithful! Now please tell me how you were tested after the demise of God’s Prophet and how you were patient and persevered. We more or less know the answer and can report it, but want to hear it from yourself as we heard those related to the lifetime of the Prophet (MGB).’ Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! Indeed God tested me on seven occasions after the demise of His Prophet (MGB) and found me obedient and persevering on every occasion due to the honor which He had granted me.O Jewish brother! About the first occasion I should say that in this world I had no one to associate with, be friends with, trust, rely upon or make any pledges with amongst the Muslims, but the Prophet (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) was my only shelter. He fostered me since my childhood and supported me in my adulthood. He (MGB) did not let me grow up like an orphan. He (MGB) alleviated my worries; made me needless of working to seek my share of daily bread; prevented me from engaging in business byproviding for my family and me. These were only his worldly aids to me. However, my spiritual gains and benefits from him through which I attained high ranks near the Honorable the Exalted God are much greater than this. When the Prophet (MGB) died I became so sad that I do not suppose all the mountains could withstand. All the members of my household became very impatient. They had lost their control. They could not tolerate this heavy burden of grief because it had made them impatient and put them out of their minds. They neither understood anything nor demanded anything. They could neither hear or speak. Other people were all influenced by this horrible situation. Some expressed condolences and sympathized with us, while others were impatient and mourned for us. I was the only one who did not lose my patience. I controlled myself and carried out the orders of the Prophet (MGB). I lifted his body; performed the ritual ablutions (wuzu) for the dead; performed the embalmment; shrouded the corpse; performed the prayer for the deceased; placed his body in the grave; and compiled the Quran and God’s decrees regarding the people. A lot of weeping, heart-aching mourning and the greatness of the calamity could not prevent me from performing my duty. I fulfilled my duties towards the Honorable the Exalted God and the Prophet (MGB) and completely performed whatever he (MGB) had ordered me to do. I was patient and I persevered.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the second occasion I should say that God’s Prophet (MGB) established me as his Trustee during his lifetime. He (MGB) had all the people who were present pledge allegiance to me so that they would listen to and obey my orders. He (MGB) instructed all who were present there to declare this to all who were absent. It was always me who informed all others of his commands while I was with the Prophet (MGB). It was always me who was the head of those who accompanied me when we traveled. I never considered anyone to be more deserving than me for anything during the lifetime of the Prophet (MGB) and after his demise.When God’s Prophet (MGB) became ill which finally resulted in his demise, he (MGB) ordered that an army be dispatched out of Medina under the command of Usamah ibn Zayd. He (MGB) dispatched anyone from the Quraysh; Aws and Khazraj etc. whom he thought might break their pledge of allegiance to me; anyone who might be hostile with me since I had killed their father, son, brother or a relative of theirs; the Emigrants (Muhajerin)and the Helpers (Ansar) and anyone with a weak belief along with Usamah Ibn Zayd. The Prophet (MGB) only kept a small group of sincere believers with him so that no one may say something out of hatred to me or hinder me from the Caliphate after the demise of the Prophet (MGB).The last thing which the Prophet (MGB) said regarding the management of his nation’s affairs was that the army of Usamah should be dispatched to war and no one under his command should disobey his orders. He (MGB) stressed this. However, once the Prophet (MGB) passed away, the very same men under whom the Prophet (MGB) had dispatched with Usamah left their posts; abandoned him; opposed the orders given by God’s Prophet (MGB); and ignored all the recommendations of the Prophet (MGB) about accompanying and helping Usamah’s army. They abandoned him and retreated to Medina to break their pledge of allegiance to me which they had made with the Prophet (MGB); break their pledge with the Honorable the Exalted God and the Prophet (MGB); and yell out in order to choose a leader for themselves without the participation or involvement of any of the members of the household of Abdul Mutalib. Their main goal was to break their pledge of allegiance which they had made to me. They were doing this while I was busy with the burial rites and rituals for the Prophet of God (MGB) and could not do anything else since attending to the Prophet’s corpse was more important than anything else. O Jewish brother! This act of the people abandoning me at this hard time burnt my heart the most. I was patient although I was mourning and had suffered from the great calamity of the loss of God’s Prophet (MGB) who was the only one I could trust besides God. I persevered on this occasion which happened immediately after the previous one.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the third occasion I should say that the one who sat in the Prophet’s (MGB) place was a fair man who came to see me everyday and apologized saying that he was ashamed that he had broken his allegiance to me, and had usurped my right. He respected me and asked for forgiveness. Based on this, I thought to myself that my God-given rights would be returned to me after him in a pleasant way. I thought that I should not wage a war in the new Islamic society that is still suffering from the remains of the ignorance of the past. I thought I should not argue so as to have some side with me and others oppose me, since then the quarrel may turn into a battle. A group of the special companions of the Prophet whom I knew well andare sincere believers in God, the Quran and the religion associated with me, invited me to claim my right in public and private. They were ready to sacrifice their lives so as to help me and honor their pledge of allegiance to me. I advised them to be calm and patient and that God may give back my due rights without any fighting or blood-shed. Many people started to doubt the religion after the demise of the Prophet (MGB), and many worthless greedy individuals were after the power to rule as the Caliph. Each tribe vociferously announced that the Caliph should be someone chosen from amongst them. What they all implied was that the affairs of the state must be in the hands of someone other than me.When the first Caliph (who is Abu Bakr) was about to die, he entrusted the affairs to his friend to be in charge after him. This was another hardship that pursued the previous one and usurped my God-given right to the position of Caliphate for the second time. Again some of the companions of the Prophet which are either dead or alive now gathered around me and repeated their concerns about my Caliphate. Again I invited them to patience and calmness so that the Islamic society may be protected, and the society which the Prophet (MGB) had formed with a lot of hardship not become disunited. The Prophet (MGB) had established the Islamic society with a genuine policy. He (MGB) had been easy-going at some times, and stern at other times. He (MGB) forgave sometimes and unsheathed his sword at other times. The Prophet (MGB) was very sympathetic with the people. He (MGB) fed them and pleased them just as soon as they approached Islam and were about to run away from it. He gave them clothing, carpets and beds even though we ourselves as the members of the household lived in homes without roofs and doors. The walls of our homes were made of date palm branches and leaves. We neither had any carpets or any blankets. Several of us shared one dress and took turns to pray with it. We remained hungry around the clock. The Prophet (MGB) even gave away the one-fifth levy that was our God-ordained rightful share to others and assisted the wealthy and materialist Arabs with it. I had to maintain the society which had been formed with this much hardship and could not lead it into the verge of separation and dispute. If I uprose and invited the people to help me, they had only one of two choices. They would either obey me and fight the opponents on my behalf and get killed, or abandoned me and become unbelievers for committing the sin of disobeying me. They all knew that their position relative to me is like the position of the people of Moses as opponents of Aaron. They knew that they would suffer a similar catastrophe like that which the people of Moses suffered due to their disobedience of Aaron. I thought that just being sorry and patient would increase my reward near the Honorable God until God ordains what He wills ‘…And the command of Allah is a decree determined.’ This would also be easier for the Islamic society which I described for you.O Jewish brother! It would have been right for me not to have paid attention to these points and demanded my rights. All the companions of the Prophet (MGB) including those who have now passed away and those who are present here acknowledge that my power is more than others; my tribe is nobler than all the other tribes; my followers are loftier and more obedient than others; the motivation of my followers to support me is higher and their nobilities and background are more outstanding as others as me myself have a good background of association with the Prophet (MGB), closeness to the Prophet (MGB), and I am the Trustee of the Prophet (MGB). Moreover, I deserve to be in charge of the position of the Caliphate due to the explicit will of the Prophet (MGB) and the pledge of allegiance which they had made to me. When the Prophet (MGB) passed away, the rule of the affairs was in the hands of his family - not their hands or that of their families. The members of the household of the Prophet (MGB) which had been purified by God deserved more to run the affairs of the state than others. They possessed all the necessary characteristics for the position of the Caliphate.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fourth occasion I should say that the one was put in charge after Abu Bakr consulted with me from the beginning to the end of everything he wanted to do and issued all decrees according to my opinion. He always sought my opinion regarding tough issues and acted accordingly. My companions and I do not know of anyone else whose counsel he seeks. No one but me was eager to become the Caliph after him. When he was attacked and about to die without any previous illnesses, I had no doubts that I was going to regain my right of Caliphate without any problems; that the future would be as I wished it to be; and that God would bring about a good future. However, he named six persons as candidates for the position of the Caliphate at the end, and I was named as the last one. He did not even consider me to be equal to them. He did not remember the fact that I was the Prophet’s relative and Trustee. He did not even remember that I was the Prophet’s groom. None of the candidates had the brilliant background and good service to Islam as I had. He let us consult amongst ourselves and chose one as the future Caliph with the majority vote. He ordered his son to cut off our necks if we disobeyed him or failed to choose one from amongst ourselves as the future Caliph.O Jewish brother! This was bitter enough for me! This group of candidates tried as hard as they could to deliver lectures and lobby on their own behalfwhile they could. I remained silent until they asked my opinion. I then presented my background and explained to them what they clearly knew. I proved my rightfulness and their unrightfulness for them. I reminded them of the Prophet’s will and their pledge of allegiance to me. However, their love for getting into office; ordering the people around; their attachment to this world; and following in the footsteps of the previous Caliphs led them to demand an undue right for themselves. Whenever I had a chance to be alone with any of them I reminded them of the Reckoning on the Resurrection Day, and frightened them of the result of their unjust demand. They would agree with me on the condition that I turn the Caliphate position over to them after myself. They knew well that I could not do so and act against the Quran and the decree of the Prophet (MGB), and turn over to them what God had withheld from them. Then one of the radical persons in the council made a radical move, took the affairs out of my hands, and turned the position of the Caliphate over to Uthman, although he never matched any of the members of the council since he was a wealthy and materialist person. He never paid any attention to the people’s noble character and religious beliefs. He ignored all spiritual noble characteristics for which God had honored the Prophet (MGB) and his Holy Household. I do not even think that the very same members of the council who appointed Uthman to the position of the Caliphate became sorry for their choice before the night of that very same day, and started to blame one another. No long time passed before they who had empowered the dictator denounced and abandoned him. Uthman got worried. He went to his supporters and his other companions and asked that they accept his resignation. He expressed his sorrow and repentance. O Jewish brother! This was even a harder calamity than the previous ones! I hoped it had never happened. I was under so much pressure for this event that it cannot be described in words. However, I had no choice but to be patient! On the very same day of pledging allegiance to Uthman, the members of the council came to me and apologized for having opposed me. They asked me to revolt against Uthman and put him out of office. They all pledged allegiance to me and promised that they would sacrifice their lives to achieve this end. However, I put things off whenever they came by and had them attend to something else. For example, once I asked them to go shave their heads before we revolt. At another time I asked them to arrange for a private meeting in such and such place. This way I kept them busy and divulged their secrets.’O Jewish brother! I swear to God that the very same considerations which had prevented me from doing anything in the past were again obstacles whichhindered me. I realized that isolation and patience is a more appropriate approach for me. It was better for me to maintain my supporters who agree with me than to revolt and have them get killed, although they were all ready to sacrifice their lives. I was even more ready to die since as those who are absent and those who are present all know that to me death is just like a sip of cold water in the mouth on a very hot day. My uncle Hamzih, my brother Ja’far, my cousin Ubaydah and I have made a pledge to God and His Prophet (MGB) and will honor it. Some of my companions went so far as to sacrifice their lives in this way. I was held back due to God’s will. The Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following verse about us, ‘Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah. of them some have completed their vow (to the extreme), and some (still) wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least:’ I swear by God that I am the one referred to in this verse as the one who still waits.O Jewish brother! I have not abandoned my pledge! The reason why I was silent in front of Uthman and did not do anything is that he is going to be punished by his own baseness and untrustworthiness which I found in him and this would draw the people from near and afar to want to dismiss and kill him. I just stayed on the side and waited until this happened. I neither said ‘yes’ nor did I say ‘no.’Then the nation rushed to the door of my house. God knows that I hated the Caliphate, since I knew that the very same people who insist in making me the Caliph are used to collecting worldly goods and having fun. Although they well knew that I would be hard on them and not fulfill their greediness, they had gotten used to rushing in doing things and could not be soothed. They hurriedly chose me by insisting a lot but when they realized that they could not gain anything from me they started to oppose and criticize me.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fifth occasion I should say that when the ones who pledged allegiance to me realized that I would not fulfill their personal aims, they rebelled against me with the help of that woman (i.e. Ayesha). They placed her on the back of a camel and turned her around in the frightening deserts and wide valleys even though I was in charge of her as the Trustee of the Prophet (MGB). The dogs at Huab barked at her and she felt sorry Yet she followed a group of people who had pledged allegiance to me bothat the time of the Prophet (MGB) and later on, and continued opposing me until she entered upon the people of Basra whose hands were short, their beards were long, their intellectual capacity was low, and their thoughts were corrupt. These people were light-headed desert dwellers. This woman took control of these unwise people and they unsheathed their swords, threw their spears and arrows without any knowledge. I had two problems with them. If I did nothing in response to them, they would not follow the intellect and put their rebellion and corruption aside. If I fought with them, then there would be a lot of blood shedding which I never wanted. I was both apologetic to them and gave an ultimatum by threatening them. I suggested to that woman to go home. I also suggested to the group who had brought her to honor their pledge of allegiance to me and not to break their covenant with the Honorable the Exalted God.I offered them as much as I had the power to. I even talked to some of them . He returned. I talked with others in the same way but their ignorance, rebellion and deviation became even more than before. I fought with them since they insisted on that. I defeated them in the war and they became sorry. Many of them were killed on the battlefield. I fought them since I had no other choice. Had I postponed fighting, they would have done things which would have prevented me from forgiving them as I did after the war.If I had not blocked them I would have been disloyal to myself and the nation and would have become a partner in the sins which they had decided to commit as follows:1- They had planned to extend their rebellion in the surroundings of the Islamic country to whatever extent they could and do acts of corruption.2- They had planned to kill and shed the blood of the citizens.3- They had planned to subject the rules of Islam and the laws of justice according to the opinions of a low-minded and unintelligent women and follow the old Roman nation; Yemen and destroyed nations of the past in this respect. Had I hesitated to fight, I would have ultimately been forced to fight with them and would also be ashamed of the evil deeds and crimes which that woman and her troops would have committed. Still I did not start the battle without hesitation. First, I gave them an ultimatum and postponed the war as much as possible. I was calm. I negotiated with them several times. I even sent several mediators to them. I made them several offers which were to their benefit. However, they turned me down on every occasion. They made me helpless, forced me to start a war, and end the issue as God willed. Given all that was done before the war they had been given enough ultimatum.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the sixth occasion I should say that it was the arbitration council and the Battle with the son of the liver-eater Hind (Muaviayh). This man had been an enemy of God, His Prophet (MGB), and the believers from the day on which God appointed Muhammad (MGB) to Prophethood until the city of Mecca was conquered by the force of the Muslims’ swords.Muaviayh and his father Abu Sufyan had pledged allegiance to me on that very same day and on three other occasions. His father was the first person who greeted me using the title of ‘the Commander of the Faithful.’ He was the one who constantly encouraged me to fight for my due rights and renewed his pledge of allegiance to me every time he met me.The strangest of all is that when Muawiyah realized that the Blessed the Sublime God had returned my right to me and had strengthened my position, he lost all hopes of becoming the fourth Caliph and ruling in our government. He turned to the disobedient Amr al-As and was generous with him so that he accepted his invitation. Amr became his fan when Muawiyah entrusted the governorship of Egypt to him, although it is forbidden for him to use even one Dirham of the taxes collected from Egypt as it was so for Muawiyah to give him any more than his own share. Then he rebelled and acted oppressively in the Islamic country. He was kind to anyone who swore allegiance to him and fended away anyone who opposed him.He joined the perfidious party (Nakiseen) in an attack against Islamic territories and looted the east, the west, the north and the south. I received the news and the reports of their deeds until the one-eyed Saqafy (Al-Muqayrih) proposed that I make peace with Muawiyah and appoint him to the governorship of the territories that were under his control. This opinion was a good one in terms of politics, but I could not bring any excuses for doing this in God’s presence and could not take responsibility for Muawiyah’s acts of oppression. I thought about this proposal and consulted with reliable people who were God-fearing and followed the Prophet (MGB). They had the same opinion as I did regarding the son of the liver-eater lady. May God not bring the day on which I use any of the oppressors as my aids.I once dispatched Jarir al-Bajaly and dispatched Abu Musa al-Ash’ari to him on another occasion. They both followed their worldly desires, theirtemptations, pleased him and were disloyal to me. I realized that they were not act according to God’s command and they were becoming more and more deviated and corrupt as time passed. I consulted with a group of the chosen companions of the Prophet from the Badriyeen who were honored by God and had participated in the pledge of allegiance at Rezvan and other noble Muslims. They unanimously agreed that we go to war with him and not let him take charge of the affairs of the Muslims.My companions and I set out to fight with him. We wrote him letters from every way-station. I sent him many representatives and invited him to put aside his corruption and join me and the other Muslims. He answered me with haughty letters; wished unsuitable wishes; and set conditions which were not acceptable by God, the Prophet and the Muslims.In one of his letters he made it a condition that we should surrender a group of the Prophet’s best companions to him including Ammar Yasir so that he could hang them in retaliation for the blood of Uthman. Where can you find someone like Ammar? I swear by God that he was always the sixth person present whenever five of us gathered around the Prophet (MGB). He was also the fourth person present whenever four of us gathered around the Prophet (MGB).He wanted to retaliate for the blood of Uthman even though he, his colleagues and his damned family who were branches of the Cursed Tree as mentioned in the Holy Quran made the people rebel against Uthman and caused him to be killed. He attacked me since I did not accept his unreasonable conditions and he was proud of his rebellion. He gathered a group of the Homayr tribes who had neither any intellect nor any insight in religion around himself and led them astray so as to follow him. He fooled them with worldly possessions and attracted them to himself.We set the Honorable the Exalted God as the judge and set out to fight him in order to stop him. We fought with him after giving him an ultimatum, so that he may have no excuses left. God made us victorious over His enemies and ours as usual.We were holding the flag of God’s Prophet (MGB) under which God had always killed the followers of Satan, but Muawiyah was holding the flag of his father under which his father had fought with God’s Prophet (MGB).He was about to die with no way out. He rode his horse, saw that his flag had fallen down and felt hopeless. He sought the help of Amr al-As. Amr al-As advised him to bring out many copies of the Quran, place them on top of their spears and to ask for the arbitration of the Quran. He told Muawiyah that since the son of Abu Talib, his followers and the rest of theHousehold of the Prophet (MGB) are religious and had invited you to arbitration of the Quran in the beginning, they would accept its arbitration from you at the end.Muawiyah accepted the idea proposed by Amr al-As since he was helpless and had no way out of war and getting killed. He placed many copies of the Quran on the spears and had them held up thinking that he was inviting the people to abide by the Quran. I had lost many of my good friends and sincere companions. The rest of the people were inclined to accept the Quran’s arbitration and stop the war. They thought that since the son of the liver-eater Hind (Muawiyah) is adhering to the rules of the Quran, he would honor them. They welcomed his call and all accepted his suggestion.I announced to them that this was a deception which Muawiyah had plotted using Amr al-As and that they would not adhere to it. However, they did not believe me and did not obey my orders. They insisted on accepting his suggestion. Whether I liked it or not, things became so bad that some of them said that we should kill Ali just like Uthman or turn him and his family over to Muawiyah if he doesn’t accept Muawiyah’s suggestion.God knows best that I did my best and tried as hard as I could to convince them to follow me, but they would not obey me. I even asked them to give me a little time - as much as milking a camel or running a horse so that I may complete the work. However, they did not accept it except for this man (while Ali (MGB) was pointing to Malik al-Ashtar), his followers, and a group of my own household. I swear by God that what hindered me from following my own idea was my fear of these two being killed (while Ali (MGB) was pointing to Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) with his hand), and the cessation of the lineage of God’s Prophet (MGB). It was also due to my fear of these two being killed (while Ali (MGB) was pointing to Abdullah ibn Ja’far and Muhammad ibn Hanifeh - may God be pleased with them - with his hand), since I knew that they were only endangered because of me. Therefore, I was forced to accept God’s destiny and accept the demands of the people. Once the battle was stopped and the swords were no long pointed at them, they demanded that they themselves be the arbiters instead of the Quran. They took over the rules of the Quran and put its decrees aside. I never considered anyone to be able to arbitrate on behalf of God’s religion since man’s arbitration in God’s religion is undoubtedly wrong. However, the people did not accept anything but arbitration.I wanted to have a knowledgeable person from my household or some of the other tribes who was wise, reliable and religious to arbitrate on my behalf. The son of Hind disagreed with whomever I named. He did not accept anyof my rightful proposals. He oppressed us through my own companions. When they insisted and wanted to force me to accept the arbitration, I sought refuge in the Honorable the Exalted God and left this up to themselves. Then they chose a man who was deceived by Amr As, and the world got filled with the shame of this act. They themselves became sorry about it.’ Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the seventh I should tell you that in his will to me, God’s Prophet (MGB) had informed me that I would fight with a tribe of my own companions near the end of my life, although they fast during the days, worship God at night and read the Quran but have put aside the religion by arguing and fighting with me just like an arrow which flies from a bow. Zul-Sadiyyeh is going to be amongst them. I will have a prosperous end after killing them. When I returned after the arbitration, some of the people started to blame each other as to why the Battle of Siffin ended by arbitration.They found themselves no solution but to except to criticize the leader and said, ‘Our leader should not have obeyed our wrong opinion. Since he was certain about our fault, he must kill either himself or those who were faulty. Since he obeyed us, he has become an unbeliever. Therefore, it is lawful for us to kill him and shed his blood now.’ They united concerning this issue, left my army rapidly and yelled ‘There is no arbiter but God!’Then they divided up. One group of them stayed in Nakhileh while a second group went to Hurura. Yet a third group of them went to the east beyond the Dijla river. They tired every Muslim they ran into by forcing him to deny me. If he argued with them, they would let him go. Otherwise they killed him. I went to see the first and the second groups and invited them to obey the Honorable the Exalted God, accept the truth and to return towards God. They did not accept anything but fighting with swords and they were not content with anything else. Since I found no other solution, I surrendered the first two groups to God’s decree. Therefore, I killed them. O Jewish Brother! I am so sorry about them. Had they not chosen this destructive route they would have not been killed. Then imagine how strong a castle could have been formed for Islam. However, God willed no other end but this unpleasant one for them. Then I wrote a letter to the third group and sent several delegates. The delegates were chosen ones. They were all God-fearing and ascetic. However, it was of no use. They did nothing but follow what the other two groups did. They hurriedlykilled the Muslims who did not agree with them and continuously killed good people. I attacked them myself and blocked off the Euphrates river from their access. Again I sent trustworthy delegates and advisors to them and made all attempts to accept their apologies by means of those men (while Ali (MGB) was pointing at Malik Ashtar; Al-Ahnaf ibn Qays; Sa’id ibn Qays al-Arhabi; and Al-Ash’as ibn Qays al-Kindi). O Jewish Brother! Since they accepted no solution except fighting, I fought with them until all of them were killed. O Jewish brother! They were all killed - all being more than forty-thousand of them. Not even one of them could flee. Then I pulled out the man who had breasts just like women have from amongst the dead corpses in front of these very same men that you see. He had breasts just like women do. Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the seventh. I was faithful to all seven and just one rank remains which is undoubtedly near.’ Then the companions of Ali (MGB) cried. The head of the Jews also cried and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Tell us another one!’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘And the last is that this (while referring to his head) shall become filled with the blood of this (while he was pointing to his crown)’. All of a sudden all the people in the Jamea Mosque started to cry and mourned so loudly that the people from all the houses in Kufa left their homes crying. Then the head of the Jews accepted Islam right then by the hand of the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) and lived in Medina until the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) was murdered by Ibn Muljam’s sword - may God damn Ibn Muljam.When the head of the Jews heard the news, he went to Ali’s (MGB) house and stood in front of Al-Hassan (MGB), while the people had gathered around him (MGB). They brought Ibn Muljam with his hands tied there. The head of the Jews said, ‘O Abu Muhammad! Kill him! May God kill him. I have seen in the books which were revealed to Moses (MGB) that in the sight of the Honorable the Exalted God this crime is much greater than the crime committed by Adam’s son when he killed his brother, and the crime of those who treated the she-camel of Thamud clan wrongfully.’",

    "chapter": "The Ninety-Seventh Assembly, the Assembly of Thursday, Eleven Nights Remain From Sha`ban, 368 AH, in the Mashhad of Our Master Abi'l Hasan `Ali b. Musa al-Rida (as)",
    "author": "Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq",
    "translator": "Bilal Muhammad",
    "englishText": "Abu Ja`far Muhammad b. Ali b. al-Husayn b. Musa b. Babuwayh al-Qummi (ra) narrated to us. He said: Muhammad b. Musa al-Mutawakkil (rh) narrated to us. He said: Muhammad b. Ya`qub narrated to us. He said: Abu Muhammad al-Qasim b. al-`Ala’ narrated to us from `Abd al-`Aziz b. Muslim. He said: In the days of `Ali b. Musa al-Rida (as), we were in Marv, and we gathered in a mosque that we would attend on Friday. The people were speaking about the matter of Imamate, and they mentioned the multitude of differences of opinion regarding it. So, I visited my Master al-Rida (as), and I informed him of the people’s discord regarding it. So, he (as) smiled, then said: O `Abd al-`Aziz! The people are ignorant, and they are deceived with regards to their religions. Surely, Allah did not cause His Prophet (s) to pass away without perfecting the religion for him. He revealed the Quran to him, in which there is elucidation for everything. In it, the lawful, the forbidden, the limits, and the rulings were made clear; as well as all of what the people need. So, He says, “We have neglected nothing in the Book” (6:38). At the Farewell Pilgrimage, at the end of his (s) life, this was revealed, “This day I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My favour unto you, and I have chosen for you Islam as a religion.” (5:3) The matter of Imamate is from the completion of religion. He (s) did not pass away until he clarified to the people the landmarks of their religion. He clarified their paths for them, left them on the way toward truth, and established `Ali (as) as their scholar and Imam. He did not leave anything that the Nation would need except that he clarified it for them. He who alleges that Allah did not perfect His religion has turned away from the Book of Allah, and he who turns away from the Book of Allah is a disbeliever. Do they even know the significance and station of Imamate in respect to the Nation for them to dare give their opinions? Surely, Imamate is of a majestic station and great affair. It is the most exalted position, the most prohibited side, and the furthest valley for the people to try to reach with their intellects, attain with their opinions; or [even] establish an Imam by their own selection. The Imamate is something Allah selected Ibrahim the Friend (s) with after prophethood and friendship as a third rank. It is a virtue that He lauded him with, and He mentions it, “Surely, I have made you an Imam for the people”, so the Friend (as), joyed by it, said, “and from my descendants?” So, Allah said, “My covenant does not go to the oppressors” (2:124). This verse invalidates the Imamate (leadership) of every oppressor until the Day of Resurrection; and it went to the elite ones. Allah honoured him by making his progeny the elite, pure people, for He says, “We blessed him with Ishaq and Ya`qub in addition, who We made of the righteous. We made them Imams who guide by Our command. We revealed to them the doing of good works, establishing prayer and giving alms; and they were worshipers of Us.” (21:73-74) His progeny did not stop inheriting it, one after the other, century after century, until it was inherited by the Prophet (s). So, He says, “Those who have most right to Ibrahim are those who follow him, this Prophet, and those who believe – and Allah is the Guardian of the believers.” (3:68) So, it was specifically for him, and the Prophet (s) bequeathed it to `Ali (as) by the command of Allah and in accordance with what Allah has ordained. Then, it went to his progeny, whom Allah gave knowledge and faith – by His saying, “As for those who were given knowledge and faith, they will say: ‘You remained, in accordance with Allah’s decree, until the Day of Resurrection’” (30:56) – so it is specifically in the progeny of `Ali (as) until the Day of Resurrection; and there is no prophet after Muhammad (s). So, how can these ignorant ones choose [for themselves]? Surely, the Imamate is the station of the prophets and the inheritance of the deputies. Surely, Imamate is the vicegerency (khilafa) of Allah, the vicegerency of the Messenger (s), the rank of Amir al-Mu’minin (as), and the inheritance of al-Hasan and al-Husayn (as). Surely, Imamate is the reins of the religion, the order of the Muslims, the rectification of this world, and the glory of the Muslims. Surely, Imamate is the foundation of Islam and its lofty branch. Through the Imam, prayer, alms, fasting, Hajj, jihad, the giving of fay’, charity, the implementation of penalties and rulings, and the frontiers are perfected. The Imam makes permissible what Allah makes permissible and makes forbidden what Allah makes forbidden. He establishes the limits of Allah, defends the religion of Allah, and calls to the way of his Lord with wisdom, goodly exhortations, and clear proof.  The Imam is like the Sun that rises over the world, in the horizons where no hands and no vision can encompass it. The Imam is the shining full Moon, the illuminating glow, the dazzling light, and the guiding star in the shroud of darkness, barren wastelands, and depths of the sea. The Imam is fresh water during thirst, the indicator to guidance, and the saviour from apostasy. The Imam is the fire of the highlands, heat for whoever needs it, and the indicator for the wayfarer – he who opposes it is destroyed. The Imam is the raincloud, the falling rain, the illuminating Sun, the soft earth, the abundant river, and the meadowy brook. The Imam is the trustworthy friend, the kind father, the caring brother, and the shelter for servants during catastrophe. The Imam is the trustee of Allah in His Earth, His Proof over His servants, His vicegerent in His lands, the caller to Allah, and the defender of the sanctity of Allah. The Imam is the purifier from sins and the curer of blemishes. He is the specialist of knowledge, bestowed with forbearance, the order of the religion, the glory of the Muslims, the wrath against the hypocrites, and the destruction against the disbelievers. The Imam is the foremost of his time – no scholar is equal to him, and there is no substitute to him. None resemble or match him. He has been wholly specified with virtue, without a need for him to seek it or reap it; surely, he is specified by the Bestower of Virtue and Gifts. So, who is him who reaches full recognition of the Imam or subjects him to their choosing? Far, far have their intellects deviated, their imaginations strayed, their minds bewildered, their eyes perplexed, their great ones drifted, their wise ones confused, their sensible ones fallen short, their preachers confined, their hearts become ignorant, their poets become speechless, and their writers become incapable. The rhetoricians cannot describe one quality of his qualities, or one virtue of his virtues, so they acknowledge their inability and shortcoming. How can [the Imam] be described in his essence? How can one comprehend a thing of his matter? How can one find one present to take his place and his prosperity? How, when he is as far as a star from the hands of the takers and the description of the describers? Where is the choice here? Where are the intellects with respect to this? What is comparable to this? Do they think that this [Imamate] exists outside of the Family of the Messenger (as)? By Allah, they have belied themselves and led themselves into fallacies. They have risen to a confuted difficulty and their feet have slipped to the bottom. They want to establish an Imam with minds that are perplexed, perverted, and partial, and with imprudent perspectives. They do not increase in it except in distance. “May Allah destroy them – how deluded they are!” (63:4) They have run into difficulty, spoken calumnies, deviated far astray, and trapped themselves in perplexity because they have abandoned the Imam. Satan has adorned their deeds for them, misguiding them from the path when they were able to see. They have gone from the selection of Allah and His Messenger to their own selection, when the Quran calls to them, “Your Lord creates what He wills, and He selects what is good for them. May Allah be glorified from what the pagans [claim].” (28:68). He says, “It is not for a believing male or female to have a choice in their affair if Allah and His Messenger commanded something.” (33:36) He says, “How is the matter with you? How do you judge? Do you have a scripture which you read that you will have whatever you choose? Or do you have oaths binding on Us until the Day of Resurrection that you will have whatever you decide? Ask them which of them can guarantee that? Or do they have partners? Then let them bring their partners if they are truthful.” (68:36-41) He says, “Do they not contemplate over the Quran, or are there locks on their hearts?” (47:24) Has Allah sealed their hearts, so they cannot understand? Or, “they say: ‘we listened’, but they do not listen. Surely, the evillest of creatures to Allah is the deaf and dumb that cannot think. Had Allah known of any good in them, He would have made them listen. If He had made them listen, they would have still turned away whilst refusing.” (8:22-23) “They said: ‘We listen and we disobey’” (2:93) Rather, “that is the blessing of Allah. He bestows it upon whom He wills. Allah is of great blessing.” (62:4) So, how would they have a choice in the Imam, when the Imam is knowing and not ignorant? He is a tireless shepherd, and the source of sanctity, purity, offering, asceticism, knowledge, and worship. He is specified by the call of the Messenger. He is of the pure, chaste lineage – he is not of an obscure ancestry, and no nobleman comes close to him. He is of the House from Quraysh, crystallized from Hashim; from the progeny of the Family of the Messenger (s), from Allah's acceptance. He is the noblest of nobles, and he is a branch from `Abd al-Manaf. He is well-versed in knowledge, perfect in forbearance, in charge of leadership, proficient in civilizing, obligatory in obedience, establishing the command of Allah, an advisor to the servants of Allah, and a protector of the religion of Allah. Surely, the prophets and the Imams are supported by Allah. He gives them of His stored knowledge and His forbearance, which is not given to anyone else. Their knowledge is above the knowledge of the people of their time – as per His saying, “Is, then, He who guides to the truth more worthy of being obeyed, or he who has no guidance at all unless he is guided [by someone else]?” (10:35) Also, His saying, “He who is given wisdom has been given much good.” (2:269) Also, His saying with regards to Talut, “Surely, Allah has selected him over you, and increased him in knowledge and in physique. Allah gives His kingdom to whomever He wills – and Allah is encompassing in knowledge.” (2:247) Also, He said to His Prophet (s), “The blessing of Allah upon you is great.” (4:113) He says, regarding the Imams from his Ahl al-Bayt, his progeny and his offspring (s), “Do the people envy those whom Allah has given His blessing? For We have given the Family of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We gave them a great kingdom. From them are those who believe in Him, and from them are those who reject Him – and Hell is a sufficient blaze.” (4:54-55) When Allah chooses a servant for the affairs of His worshipers, Allah expands his chest for that, puts fountains of wisdom in his heart, and inspires (ilham) him with knowledge. After that, he is aware of no other answer, and his reasoning remains consistent. He is immaculate, aided, supported, and directed. He is safe from errors, slips, and stumbles – Allah specifies this for him so that he may be His proof over His servants and His witness over His creation. “That is the blessing of Allah. He bestows it upon whom He wills. Allah is of great blessing.” (62:4) So, are they capable of being something like this, so that they may select him? Or, is the one that they select capable of taking on this description? They have transgressed, and the House of Allah is the truth. They threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, as though they do not know; and in the Book of Allah is guidance and healing, but they neglected it and followed their whims. So, Allah cursed them, despised them, and made them miserable. He says, “Who is more misguided than him who follows his whims without guidance from Allah? Surely, Allah does not guide the oppressive people.” (28:50) He says, “May they be doomed and may He render their deeds void.” (47:8) He says, “It is greatly hateful in the sight of Allah and in the sight of those who believe. In this way, Allah seals the heart of every arrogant tyrant.” (40:35)",

الله عز وجل فهو كافر. هل يعرفون قدر الامامة ومحلها من الامة، فيجوز فيها اختيارهم؟ إن الامامة أجل قدرا وأعظم شأنا، وأعلى مكانا، وأمنع جانبا، وأبعد غورا من أن يبلغها الناس بعقولهم، أو ينالوها بآرائهم، أو يقيموا إماما باختيارهم، إن الامامة خص الله عز وجل بها إبراهيم الخليل (صلى الله عليه وآله) بعد النبوة، والخلة مرتبة ثالثة، وفضيلة شرفه الله بها، فأشاد (3) بها ذكره، فقال عزوجل: (إنى جاعلك للناس إماما) فقال الخليل (عليه السلام) سرورا بها: (ومن ذريتي)؟ قال: الله تبارك وتعالى: (لا ينال عهدي الظالمين) (4)، فأبطلت هذه الآية إمامة كل ظالم إلى يوم القيامة وصارت في الصفوة، ثم أكرمه الله بأن جعلها في ذريته أهل الصفوة والطهارة، فقال عز وجل: (ووهبنا له إسحاق ويعقوب نافلة وكلا جعلنا صالحين * وجعلناهم أئمة يهدون بأمرنا وأوحينا إليهم فعل الخيرات وإقام الصلاة وإيتاء الزكاة وكانوا لنا عابدين) (5). فلم تزل في ذريته يرثها بعض عن بعض قرنا فقرنا (6) حتى ورثها النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله)، فقال جل جلاله: (إن أولى الناس بإبراهيم للذين اتبعوه وهذا النبي والذين ءامنوا والله ولى المؤمنين) (1) فكانت له خاصة، فقلدها النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله) عليا (عليه السلام) بأمر الله عز وجل على رسم ما فرض الله، فصارت في ذريته الاصفياء الذين آتاهم الله العلم والايمان بقوله عز وجل (وقال الذين أوتوا العلم والايمان لقد لبثتم في كتاب الله إلي يوم البعث) (2) فهي في ولد علي (عليه السلام) خاصة إلى يوم القيامة، إذ لا نبي بعد محمد (صلى الله عليه وآله). فمن أين يختار هؤلاء الجهال أن الامامة هي منزلة الانبياء وإرث الاوصياء؟ إن الامامة خلافة الله عز وجل وخلافة الرسول (صلى الله عليه وآله) ومقام أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) وميراث الحسن والحسين (عليهما السلام)، إن الامامة زمام الدين ونظام المسلمين وصلاح الدنيا وعز المؤمنين، إن الامامة أس الاسلام النامي وفرعه السامي، بالامام تمام الصلاة، والزكاة، والصيام، والحج، والجهاد، وتوفير الفئ، والصدقات، وإمضاء الحدود والاحكام، ومنع الثغور والاطراف، الامام يحل حلال الله ويحرم حرام الله، ويقيم حدود الله، ويذب عن دين الله، ويدعوا إلى سبيل ربه بالحكمة والموعظة الحسنة والحجة البالغة. الامام كالشمس الطالعة للعالم، وهي في الافق بحيث لا تنالها الايدي والابصار، الامام البدر المنير، والسراج الزاهر، والنور الساطع، والنجم الهادي في غياهب الدجى والبلد القفار ولجج البحار، الامام الماء العذب على الظمأ، والدال على الهدى، والمنجي من الردى، الامام النار على اليفاع (3)، الحار لمن اصطلى به، والدليل على المسالك (4)، من فارقه فهالك، الامام السحاب الماطر، والغيث الهاطل، والشمس المضيئة، والارض والبسيطة، والعين الغزيرة، والغدير والروضة. الامام الامين الرفيق، والوالد الرقيق، والاخ الشفيق، ومفزع العباد في الداهية، الامام أمين الله في أرضه، وحجته على عباده، وخليفته في بلاده، والداعي إلى الله، والذاب عن حرم الله، الامام المطهر من الذنوب، المبرأ من العيوب، مخصوص بالعلم، موسوم بالحلم، نظام الدين، وعز المسلمين، وغيظ المنافقين، وبوار الكافرين، الامام واحد دهره، لا يدانيه أحد، ولا يعادله عالم، ولا يوجد عنه (1) بدل، ولا له مثل ولا نظير، مخصوص بالفضل كله من غير طلب منه له (2) ولا اكتساب، بل اختصاص من المفضل الوهاب. فمن ذا الذي يبلغ معرفة الامام أو يمكنه اختياره؟ هيهات هيهات، ضلت العقول، وتاهت الحلوم، وحارت الالباب، وحسرت العيون، وتصاغرت العظماء، وتحيرت الحكماء، وتقاصرت الحلماء، وحصرت الخطباء، وجهلت الالباء، وكلت الشعراء، وعجزت الادباء، وعييت البلغاء عن وصف شأن من شأنه، أو فضيلة من فضائله، فأقرت بالعجز والتقصير، وكيف يوصف أو ينعت بكنهه، أو يفهم شئ من أمره، أو يوجد من يقوم مقامه، ويغني غناءه؟ لا، كيف وأنى (3) وهو بحيث النجم من أيدي المتناولين ووصف الواصفين، فأين الاختيار من هذا، وأين العقول عن هذا، وأين يوجد مثل هذا؟ أظنوا أن ذلك يوجد في غير آل الرسول (عليهم السلام)؟ كذبتهم والله أنفسهم، ومنتهم الاباطيل، وارتقوا مرتقا صعبا دحضا (4)، تزل عنه إلى الحضيض أقدامهم، راموا إقامة الامام بعقول حائرة بائرة ناقصة، وآراء مضلة، فلم يزدادوا منه إلا بعدا، قاتلهم الله أنى يؤفكون، لقد راموا صعبا، وقالوا إفكا، وضلوا ضلالا بعيدا، ووقعوا في الحيرة، إذ تركوا الامام عن بصيرة، وزين لهم الشيطان أعمالهم فصدهم عن السبيل وكانوا مستبصرين، رغبوا عن اختيار الله واختيار رسوله إلى اختيارهم، والقرآن يناديهم: (وربك يخلق ما يشاء ويختار ما كان لهم الخيرة سبحان الله وتعالى عما يشركون) (1)، وقال عز وجل: (وما كان لمؤمن ولا مؤمنة إذا قضى الله ورسوله أمرا أن يكون لهم الخيرة من أمرهم) (2)، وقال عز وجل: (وما لكم كيف تحكمون * أم لكم كتاب فيه تدرسون * إن لكم فيه لما تخيرون * أم لكم أيمان علينا بالغة إلى يوم القيامة إن لكم لما تحكمون * سلهم أيهم بذلك زعيم * أم لهم شركاء فليأتوا بشركائهم إن كانوا صادقين) (3)، وقال عز وجل: (أفلا يتدبرون القرآن أم على قلوب أقفالها) (4) أم طبع الله على قلوبهم فهم لا يفقهون أم (قالوا سمعنا وهم لا يسمعون * إن شر الدواب عند الله الصم البكم الذين لا يعقلون * ولو علم الله فيهم خيرا لاسمعهم ولو أسمعهم لتولوا وهم معرضون) (5)، و (قالوا سمعنا وعصينا) (6) بل هو (فضل الله يؤتيه من يشاء والله ذو الفضل العظيم) (7). فكيف لهم باختيار الامام، والامام عالم لا يجهل، راع لا ينكل، معدن القدس والطهارة والنسك والزهادة والعلم والعبادة، مخصوص بدعوة الرسول، وهو نسل المطهرة البتول، لا مغمز فيه في نسب، ولا يدانيه ذو حسب، في البيت من قريش، والذروة من هاشم، والعترة من آل الرسول (8)، والرضا من الله، شرف الاشراف، والفرع من عبد مناف، نامي العلم، كامل الحلم، مضطلع بالامامة، عالم بالسياسة، مفروض الطاعة، قائم بأمر الله، ناصح لعباد الله، حافظ لدين الله. إن الانبياء والائمة يوفقهم الله عز وجل ويؤتيهم من مخزون علمه وحلمه وما لا يؤتيه غيرهم، فيكون علمهم فوق كل علم أهل زمانهم في قوله عز وجل: (أفمن يهدى إلى الحق أحق أن يتبع أمن لا يهدى إلا أن يهدى فما لكم كيف تحكمون) (1)، وقوله عز وجل: (ومن يؤت الحكمة فقد أوتى خيرا كثيرا) (2)، وقوله عز وجل في طالوت: (إن الله اصطفاه عليكم وزاده بسطة في العلم والجسم والله يؤتى ملكه من يشاء والله واسع عليم) (3)، وقال عز وجل لنبيه (صلى الله عليه وآله): (وكان فضل الله عليك عظيما) (4)، وقال عز وجل في الائمة من أهل بيته وعترته وذريته (صلوات الله عليهم): * (أم يحسدون الناس على ما أتاهم الله من فضله فقد آتينا ءال إبراهيم الكتاب والحكمة وءاتيناهم ملكا عظيما * فمنهم من ءامن به ومنهم من صد عنه وكفى بجهنم سعيرا) (5). وإن العبد إذا اختاره الله عز وجل لامور عباده، شرح صدره لذلك، وأودع قلبه ينابيع الحكمة، وألهمه العلم إلهاما، فلم يعي بعده بجواب، ولا يحير فيه عن الصواب، وهو معصوم مؤيد موفق مسدد، قد أمن الخطايا والزلل والعثار، وخصه الله بذلك ليكون حجته على عباده، وشاهده على خلقه، وذلك فضل الله يؤتيه من يشاء والله ذو الفضل العظيم. فهل يقدرون على مثل هذا فيختاروه، أو يكون مختارهم بهذه الصفة فيقدموه؟ تعدوا وبيت الله الحق، ونبذوا كتاب الله وراء ظهورهم كأنهم لا يعلمون، وفي كتاب الله الهدى والشفاء، فنبذوه واتبعوا أهواءهم، فذمهم الله ومقتهم وأتعسهم، فقال عز وجل: (ومن أضل ممن اتبع هواه بغير هدى من الله إن الله لا يهدى القوم الظالمين) (1) وقال عز وجل: (فتعسا لهم وأضل أعمالهم) (2)، وقال عز وجل: (كبر مقتا عند الله وعند الذين ءامنوا كذلك يطبع الله على كل قلب متكبر جبار) (3).",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "Abu Ja`far Muhammad b. Ali b. al-Husayn b. Musa b. Babuwayh al-Qummi (ra) narrated to us. He said: Muhammad b. Musa al-Mutawakkil (rh) narrated to us. He said: Muhammad b. Ya`qub narrated to us. He said: Abu Muhammad al-Qasim b. al-`Ala’ narrated to us from `Abd al-`Aziz b. Muslim. He said: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "In the days of `Ali b. Musa al-Rida (as), we were in Marv, and we gathered in a mosque that we would attend on Friday. The people were speaking about the matter of Imamate, and they mentioned the multitude of differences of opinion regarding it. So, I visited my Master al-Rida (as), and I informed him of the people’s discord regarding it. So, he (as) smiled, then said: O `Abd al-`Aziz! The people are ignorant, and they are deceived with regards to their religions. Surely, Allah did not cause His Prophet (s) to pass away without perfecting the religion for him. He revealed the Quran to him, in which there is elucidation for everything. In it, the lawful, the forbidden, the limits, and the rulings were made clear; as well as all of what the people need. So, He says, “We have neglected nothing in the Book” (6:38). At the Farewell Pilgrimage, at the end of his (s) life, this was revealed, “This day I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My favour unto you, and I have chosen for you Islam as a religion.” (5:3) The matter of Imamate is from the completion of religion. He (s) did not pass away until he clarified to the people the landmarks of their religion. He clarified their paths for them, left them on the way toward truth, and established `Ali (as) as their scholar and Imam. He did not leave anything that the Nation would need except that he clarified it for them. He who alleges that Allah did not perfect His religion has turned away from the Book of Allah, and he who turns away from the Book of Allah is a disbeliever. Do they even know the significance and station of Imamate in respect to the Nation for them to dare give their opinions? Surely, Imamate is of a majestic station and great affair. It is the most exalted position, the most prohibited side, and the furthest valley for the people to try to reach with their intellects, attain with their opinions; or [even] establish an Imam by their own selection. The Imamate is something Allah selected Ibrahim the Friend (s) with after prophethood and friendship as a third rank. It is a virtue that He lauded him with, and He mentions it, “Surely, I have made you an Imam for the people”, so the Friend (as), joyed by it, said, “and from my descendants?” So, Allah said, “My covenant does not go to the oppressors” (2:124). This verse invalidates the Imamate (leadership) of every oppressor until the Day of Resurrection; and it went to the elite ones. Allah honoured him by making his progeny the elite, pure people, for He says, “We blessed him with Ishaq and Ya`qub in addition, who We made of the righteous. We made them Imams who guide by Our command. We revealed to them the doing of good works, establishing prayer and giving alms; and they were worshipers of Us.” (21:73-74) His progeny did not stop inheriting it, one after the other, century after century, until it was inherited by the Prophet (s). So, He says, “Those who have most right to Ibrahim are those who follow him, this Prophet, and those who believe – and Allah is the Guardian of the believers.” (3:68) So, it was specifically for him, and the Prophet (s) bequeathed it to `Ali (as) by the command of Allah and in accordance with what Allah has ordained. Then, it went to his progeny, whom Allah gave knowledge and faith – by His saying, “As for those who were given knowledge and faith, they will say: ‘You remained, in accordance with Allah’s decree, until the Day of Resurrection’” (30:56) – so it is specifically in the progeny of `Ali (as) until the Day of Resurrection; and there is no prophet after Muhammad (s). So, how can these ignorant ones choose [for themselves]? Surely, the Imamate is the station of the prophets and the inheritance of the deputies. Surely, Imamate is the vicegerency (khilafa) of Allah, the vicegerency of the Messenger (s), the rank of Amir al-Mu’minin (as), and the inheritance of al-Hasan and al-Husayn (as). Surely, Imamate is the reins of the religion, the order of the Muslims, the rectification of this world, and the glory of the Muslims. Surely, Imamate is the foundation of Islam and its lofty branch. Through the Imam, prayer, alms, fasting, Hajj, jihad, the giving of fay’, charity, the implementation of penalties and rulings, and the frontiers are perfected. The Imam makes permissible what Allah makes permissible and makes forbidden what Allah makes forbidden. He establishes the limits of Allah, defends the religion of Allah, and calls to the way of his Lord with wisdom, goodly exhortations, and clear proof.  The Imam is like the Sun that rises over the world, in the horizons where no hands and no vision can encompass it. The Imam is the shining full Moon, the illuminating glow, the dazzling light, and the guiding star in the shroud of darkness, barren wastelands, and depths of the sea. The Imam is fresh water during thirst, the indicator to guidance, and the saviour from apostasy. The Imam is the fire of the highlands, heat for whoever needs it, and the indicator for the wayfarer – he who opposes it is destroyed. The Imam is the raincloud, the falling rain, the illuminating Sun, the soft earth, the abundant river, and the meadowy brook. The Imam is the trustworthy friend, the kind father, the caring brother, and the shelter for servants during catastrophe. The Imam is the trustee of Allah in His Earth, His Proof over His servants, His vicegerent in His lands, the caller to Allah, and the defender of the sanctity of Allah. The Imam is the purifier from sins and the curer of blemishes. He is the specialist of knowledge, bestowed with forbearance, the order of the religion, the glory of the Muslims, the wrath against the hypocrites, and the destruction against the disbelievers. The Imam is the foremost of his time – no scholar is equal to him, and there is no substitute to him. None resemble or match him. He has been wholly specified with virtue, without a need for him to seek it or reap it; surely, he is specified by the Bestower of Virtue and Gifts. So, who is him who reaches full recognition of the Imam or subjects him to their choosing? Far, far have their intellects deviated, their imaginations strayed, their minds bewildered, their eyes perplexed, their great ones drifted, their wise ones confused, their sensible ones fallen short, their preachers confined, their hearts become ignorant, their poets become speechless, and their writers become incapable. The rhetoricians cannot describe one quality of his qualities, or one virtue of his virtues, so they acknowledge their inability and shortcoming. How can [the Imam] be described in his essence? How can one comprehend a thing of his matter? How can one find one present to take his place and his prosperity? How, when he is as far as a star from the hands of the takers and the description of the describers? Where is the choice here? Where are the intellects with respect to this? What is comparable to this? Do they think that this [Imamate] exists outside of the Family of the Messenger (as)? By Allah, they have belied themselves and led themselves into fallacies. They have risen to a confuted difficulty and their feet have slipped to the bottom. They want to establish an Imam with minds that are perplexed, perverted, and partial, and with imprudent perspectives. They do not increase in it except in distance. “May Allah destroy them – how deluded they are!” (63:4) They have run into difficulty, spoken calumnies, deviated far astray, and trapped themselves in perplexity because they have abandoned the Imam. Satan has adorned their deeds for them, misguiding them from the path when they were able to see. They have gone from the selection of Allah and His Messenger to their own selection, when the Quran calls to them, “Your Lord creates what He wills, and He selects what is good for them. May Allah be glorified from what the pagans [claim].” (28:68). He says, “It is not for a believing male or female to have a choice in their affair if Allah and His Messenger commanded something.” (33:36) He says, “How is the matter with you? How do you judge? Do you have a scripture which you read that you will have whatever you choose? Or do you have oaths binding on Us until the Day of Resurrection that you will have whatever you decide? Ask them which of them can guarantee that? Or do they have partners? Then let them bring their partners if they are truthful.” (68:36-41) He says, “Do they not contemplate over the Quran, or are there locks on their hearts?” (47:24) Has Allah sealed their hearts, so they cannot understand? Or, “they say: ‘we listened’, but they do not listen. Surely, the evillest of creatures to Allah is the deaf and dumb that cannot think. Had Allah known of any good in them, He would have made them listen. If He had made them listen, they would have still turned away whilst refusing.” (8:22-23) “They said: ‘We listen and we disobey’” (2:93) Rather, “that is the blessing of Allah. He bestows it upon whom He wills. Allah is of great blessing.” (62:4) So, how would they have a choice in the Imam, when the Imam is knowing and not ignorant? He is a tireless shepherd, and the source of sanctity, purity, offering, asceticism, knowledge, and worship. He is specified by the call of the Messenger. He is of the pure, chaste lineage – he is not of an obscure ancestry, and no nobleman comes close to him. He is of the House from Quraysh, crystallized from Hashim; from the progeny of the Family of the Messenger (s), from Allah's acceptance. He is the noblest of nobles, and he is a branch from `Abd al-Manaf. He is well-versed in knowledge, perfect in forbearance, in charge of leadership, proficient in civilizing, obligatory in obedience, establishing the command of Allah, an advisor to the servants of Allah, and a protector of the religion of Allah. Surely, the prophets and the Imams are supported by Allah. He gives them of His stored knowledge and His forbearance, which is not given to anyone else. Their knowledge is above the knowledge of the people of their time – as per His saying, “Is, then, He who guides to the truth more worthy of being obeyed, or he who has no guidance at all unless he is guided [by someone else]?” (10:35) Also, His saying, “He who is given wisdom has been given much good.” (2:269) Also, His saying with regards to Talut, “Surely, Allah has selected him over you, and increased him in knowledge and in physique. Allah gives His kingdom to whomever He wills – and Allah is encompassing in knowledge.” (2:247) Also, He said to His Prophet (s), “The blessing of Allah upon you is great.” (4:113) He says, regarding the Imams from his Ahl al-Bayt, his progeny and his offspring (s), “Do the people envy those whom Allah has given His blessing? For We have given the Family of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We gave them a great kingdom. From them are those who believe in Him, and from them are those who reject Him – and Hell is a sufficient blaze.” (4:54-55) When Allah chooses a servant for the affairs of His worshipers, Allah expands his chest for that, puts fountains of wisdom in his heart, and inspires (ilham) him with knowledge. After that, he is aware of no other answer, and his reasoning remains consistent. He is immaculate, aided, supported, and directed. He is safe from errors, slips, and stumbles – Allah specifies this for him so that he may be His proof over His servants and His witness over His creation. “That is the blessing of Allah. He bestows it upon whom He wills. Allah is of great blessing.” (62:4) So, are they capable of being something like this, so that they may select him? Or, is the one that they select capable of taking on this description? They have transgressed, and the House of Allah is the truth. They threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, as though they do not know; and in the Book of Allah is guidance and healing, but they neglected it and followed their whims. So, Allah cursed them, despised them, and made them miserable. He says, “Who is more misguided than him who follows his whims without guidance from Allah? Surely, Allah does not guide the oppressive people.” (28:50) He says, “May they be doomed and may He render their deeds void.” (47:8) He says, “It is greatly hateful in the sight of Allah and in the sight of those who believe. In this way, Allah seals the heart of every arrogant tyrant.” (40:35)",

He said: “Throw dust in the faces of those who overpraise.” He (s) said: “Whoever supports the argument of an oppressor or supports him in it, when the Angel of Death comes down to him, it will say to him: ‘I give you tidings of the curse of Allah and the Fire of Hell in the misery of fate.’ Whoever praises a tyrannical leader and eases him and incites him for his own benefit, he will follow him into the Fire.” He (s) said: “Allah says, ‘And do not be inclined to the oppressors or you will be touched by the Fire.’ (11:113)”\r\nHe (s) said: “Whoever recites the Quran, then drinks something forbidden, or was affected by love of this world and its frills, will have made the indignation of Allah obligatory on himself, unless he repents. If he dies without repenting, then he will have deserted the Quran on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be invalidated.” Surely, whoever commits adultery with a Muslim woman, a Jewish woman, a Christian woman, or a Zoroastrian woman, free or bond, and does not repent, and dies insistent on that, Allah will open three hundred gates to his grave, from which snakes, scorpions, and serpents of the Fire will come through. He will burn until the Day of Resurrection. When he is resurrected from his grave, the people will seek refuge from the stench of his smell, and he will be recognized for that and for what he did in the abode of this world, until he is sent to the Fire. Surely, it is Allah that forbade the forbidden and set the penalties (or limits), and not one other than Allah. It is none but He who forbade immoral actions. He prohibited looking into the house one’s neighbour. He said: “Whoever intentionally looks at the private of his Muslim brother or the private of one from outside his family, Allah will include him among the hypocrites who would implore about the privates of Muslims. He will not come out of this world until Allah exposes him unless he repents.” He (s) said: “Whoever is not pleased with what Allah allotted for him of sustenance, and broadcasts his complaints, and does not exercise patience and consideration, his good deeds will not be raised up. He will meet Allah while He is angry unless he repents.” He prohibited strutting while walking. He said: “Whoever wears a robe and struts in it, Allah will take him to the edge of Hell. He will follow Qarun because he was the first who strutted about his house on Earth. Whoever struts has challenged Allah in His might.” He (s) said: “Whoever oppresses a woman of her dowry is considered by Allah to be an adulterer. Allah will say to him on the Day of Resurrection: ‘My servant! I have married you to My maidservant upon My covenant, but you did not fulfill My covenant. You have oppressed My maidservant.’ So, she will take from his good deeds in proportion to what is owed to her. If he does not have enough good deeds, he will be ordered to the Fire, having abandoned the covenant. ‘Surely, you will be accounted for your covenant.’ (17:34)” He (s) prohibited concealing testimonies. He said: “Whoever conceals it, Allah will feed his flesh to the heads of creatures.” That is the saying of Allah, “Do not conceal the testimony, for whoever conceals it, their hearts are surely sinful.” (2:283) The Messenger of Allah (s) said: “Whoever harms his neighbour, Allah forbids the fragrance of Paradise from him, and his place will be in Hell in the misery of fate. Whoever squanders the right of his neighbour is not of us. Gabriel has not stopped advising me about the neighbour, to the point where I thought that he would also inherit. He has not stopped advising me about the slaves, to the point where I thought that they would be freed once they reached a certain time. He did not stop advising me about the toothstick, to the point where I thought that he would make it an obligation. He did not stop advising me about standing at night in prayer, to the point where I thought that the best of my Nation would not sleep. Surely, whoever does not take the affairs of a poor Muslim seriously, Allah will not take his rights seriously, and Allah will not take his affairs seriously on the Day of Resurrection, unless he repents.” He (s) said: “Whoever is generous to a poor Muslim, he will meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection, and He will be pleased with him.” He (s) said: “Whoever is presented with an indecency or a temptation and avoids them out of the fear of Allah, Allah will forbid the Fire from him. He will safeguard him from the Great Dismay, and He will reward him with what He promised in His Book, in His saying, ‘For he who fears standing before his Lord is two gardens.’ (55:46)” Surely, whoever is presented with this world and the Hereafter, and he chooses this world over the Hereafter, he will meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection without a good deed to prevent him from the Fire. Whoever chooses the Hereafter over this world, Allah will be pleased with him, and He will forgive him of his sinful actions. Whoever fills his eye with forbidden things, Allah will fill his eye with fire on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever attaches himself to a woman that is forbidden to him, he will be in a ring of fire with Satan, and they will be cast into the Fire. Whoever cheats a Muslim in buying or selling is not of us, and he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection with the Jews, because they cheat the Muslims the most among the creation. The Messenger of Allah (s) prohibited depriving anyone of kindness. He said: “Whoever deprives his neighbour of kindness, Allah will deprive him of His goodness on the Day of Resurrection. He will assign him to himself, and whoever is assigned to himself will be in the worst condition!” He (s) said: “When a woman harms her husband with her tongue, Allah does not accept her compulsory, voluntary, or good deeds until she pleases him; even if she fasts during the day, prays during the night, frees slaves, and mounts a horse [to fight] in the cause of Allah, she will be the first to be sent to the Fire. It is the same for the man if was oppressive toward her.” Surely, whoever strikes the cheek or the face of a Muslim, Allah will scatter his bones on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be resurrected chained up until he enters Hell, unless he repents. Whoever goes to sleep while having cheated his brother in his heart has slept upon the indignation of Allah and will awake thereupon until he repents. He prohibited backbiting. \r\nHe said: “Whoever backbites a Muslim person will have invalidated his fasting and cancelled out his ablution. He will be brought on the Day of Resurrection smelling like a corpse. His smell will harm the people of the stand. If he dies before he repents, he will die allowing that which was forbidden by Allah.” He (s) said: “Whoever forbears an oppression while he is capable of enforcing [his right], Allah gives him the reward of a martyr.” Surely, whoever refutes the backbiting of his brother in a gathering, Allah repels seventy gates of harm from him in this world and the Hereafter. If he does not refute it while he is able to, then he will have the sin of one who backbites seventy times. The Messenger of Allah (s) prohibited betrayal. He said: “Whoever betrays a trust in this world and does not give it to its rightful owner, then dies, will have died upon a creed other than mine. He will meet Allah while He is angry.” He (s) said: “Whoever bears false witness over one of the people, his tongue will be hung with the hypocrites in the lowest depth of the Fire.” Whoever knowingly hires a betrayer, then he is like the betrayer. Whoever withholds a right of his Muslim brother, Allah will forbid the blessing of sustenance from him, unless he repents. Surely, whoever hears of an indecency and spreads it, then he is like the one that did it. Whoever is approached by his Muslim brother for a loan, and he is capable of giving it but he does not, Allah will forbid the fragrance of Paradise from him. Whoever exercises patience over the poor manners of a woman, seeking a reward [from Allah], Allah will give him the rewards of the thankful in the Hereafter. Surely, if a woman is not compassionate with her spouse, and she makes him do that which he cannot handle, her good deeds will not be accepted, and she will meet Allah while He is angry. Surely, whoever is generous to his Muslim brother is being generous to Allah. The Messenger of Allah (s) prohibited leading a community [in prayer] without their permission. He said: “Whoever leads a community and they are pleased with him, and he gives them his time, and beautifies his prayer in his standing, his recitation, his bowing, his prostration, and his sitting, then he will have a reward like that of the community without decreasing anything of their reward. Surely, whoever leads a community and does not perfect his prayer with him, and does not beautify his humility [before Allah], his bowing, his prostration, and his recitation, his prayer will be rejected and it will not rise above his position. His status will be like that of an oppressive and aggressive leader that cannot rectify his flock and cannot establish any right in them and did not establish an order in them.” He said: “Whoever walks to his relative with his self and his wealth to connect his blood ties, Allah gives him the reward of one hundred martyrs. He will be given one thousand good deeds for every step that he takes, and forty thousand sins will be erased from him, and he will be raised in rank in proportion to that. It will be as though he worshiped Allah for one hundred years in patience and anticipation.\r\nWhoever takes up a need of a blind person and continues until Allah fulfills the need for him, Allah will dissociate him from hypocrisy and dissociate him from the Fire; and He will fulfill seventy needs for him from the needs of this world, and he will remain in the mercy of Allah until he returns [to Allah]. Whoever becomes ill for a day and a night and does not complain to his visitors, Allah raises him on the Day of Resurrection with His Friend Ibrahim the Friend of the Merciful, until he passes through the Path like a bolt of lightening. Whoever goes intending to fulfill a need for an ill person, and fulfills it or does not fulfill it, he will come out of his sins [and be sinless] like the day his mother gave birth to him.”\r\nSo, a man from the Ansar said: “May my mother and my father be your sacrifice, O Messenger of Allah! If the ill person were from his family, is there not a greater reward for him who strives to fulfill a need for his family?” He said: “Yes. Surely, whoever relieves a believer of a burden from the burdens of this world, Allah relieves him of seventy-two burdens from the burdens of the Hereafter, and He relieves him of the pain of seventy-two burdens of this world.” He said: “Whoever invalidates the right of a rightful person when he is capable of fulfilling his need will have tens of sins every day. Surely, whoever whips [a person] in front of a tyrant, Allah will make that whip into a serpent of fire that will be seventy cubits long, and he will be whipped with it in the Fire in the misery of fate. Whoever constrains a good from coming to his brother, Allah invalidates his deeds, makes his sin resolute, and does not thank him for his endeavour.”\r\nThen, he (s) said: “Allah says: ‘Paradise is forbidden for one who is wealthy yet stingy; as well as for the backbiter, who is the gossiper.’ Surely, whoever gives in charity, each silver coin that he gives will be a blessing in Paradise, the weight of each of which is like that of Mount Uhud. Whoever brings a charity [of someone else] to a needy person, he will have the reward of the owner [of the charity] without decreasing a thing of his reward. Whoever prays over a deceased person, seventy-thousand angels will pray over him, and Allah will forgive all his past sins. Whoever attends [the funeral] until he is buried and dirt is thrown onto him, he will be rewarded with a carat for each step that he took; each carat will be like Mount Uhud. Surely, whoever sheds a tear in humility before Allah, he will have a palace in Paradise for each tear, decked with pearl and jewels – in it will be that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human heart has imagined. \r\nSurely, whoever goes to the mosque seeking congregational prayer will receive seventy thousand good deeds with each step, and he will be raised in rank in proportion to that. If he dies while doing that, Allah will assign one thousand angels to visit him in his grave. They will bring comfort to him in his solitude, and they will seek forgiveness on his behalf until he is resurrected. Surely, whoever gives the call to prayer in anticipation, seeking the face of Allah with it, Allah will grant him the reward of forty thousand martyrs and forty thousand saints. His intercession will encompass forty thousand people from my Nation, and they will go to Paradise. Surely, when the mu’adhin says: ‘I bear witness that there is no god but Allah’, ninety thousand angels will bless him and ask for forgiveness on his behalf. On the Day of Resurrection, he will be in the shade of the Throne until the creatures are finished with the judgment. When he says: ‘I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah’, forty thousand angels will record his deeds. Whoever secures the first row and the first takbir, and does not harm a Muslim, Allah will reward him with that which is given to the mu’adhins in this world and the Hereafter. Surely, whoever aligns with a fortune-teller, Allah will imprison him at the edge of Hell. For every day [he went, he will be there for] one thousand years. He will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment with his hands chained to his neck. When he stands to be judged by Allah, Allah will cast him away. If he was oppressive, he will be sent to the Fire in the misery of fate.”\r\nHe (s) said: “Do not underestimate evil, not matter how small it is in your eyes, and do not overestimate goodness, no matter how much of it is in your eyes. There is nothing too big for repentance, and there is nothing too small for persistence.”\r\nMuhammad b. Zakariyya al-Ghilabi said: I asked Shu`ayb al-Muzni (the narrator) about the length of this report, so he said to me: O Aba `Abdillah! I asked al-Husayn b. Zayd about the length of this hadith, so he said: Ja`far b. Muhammad b. `Ali b. al-Husayn b. `Ali b. Abi Talib (as) narrated to me that he gathered this hadith from a book that was the dictations of the Messenger of Allah (s) and the handwriting of `Ali b. Abi Talib (as).",

له صلاة أربعين يوما، وإن مات وفي بطنه شئ من ذلك كان حقا على الله أن يسقيه من طينة خبال، وهو صديد أهل النار، وما يخرج من فروج الزناة، فيجتمع ذلك في قدور جهنم، فيشربها أهل النار، فيصهر به ما في بطونهم

ظلموا فتمسكم النار) (1). وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من دل جائرا على جور، كان قرين هامان في جهنم، ومن بنى بنيانا رياء وسمعة حمله يوم القيامة من الارض السابعة وهو نار تشتعل، ثم يطوق في عنقه، ويلقى في النار، فلا يحبسه شئ منها دون قعرها، إلا أن يتوب. قيل: يا رسول الله، كيف يبني رياء وسمعة، قال: يبني فضلا على ما يكفيه استطالة منه على جيرانه، ومباهاة لاخوانه. وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من ظلم أجيرا أجره أحبط الله عمله وحرم عليه ريح الجنة، وإن ريحها لتوجد من مسيرة خمسمائة عام، ومن خان جاره شبرا من الارض جعلها الله طوقا في عنقه من تخوم الارضين السابعة، حتى يلقى الله يوم القيامة مطوقا، إلا أن يتوب ويرجع. ألا ومن تعلم القرآن ثم نسيه متعمدا، لقي الله يوم القيامة مغلولا، يسلط الله عليه بكل آية منه حية تكون قرينه إلى النار، إلا أن يغفر له، وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من قرأ القرآن ثم شرب عليه حراما أو آثر عليه حبا للدنيا وزينتها، استوجب عليه سخط الله، إلا أن يتوب، ألا وإنه إن مات على غير توبة حاجة القرآن يوم القيامة، فلا يزايله إلا مدحوضا. ألا ومن زنا بامرأة مسلمة أو يهودية أو نصرانية أو مجوسية، حرة أو أمة، ثم لم يتب ومات مصرا عليه، فتح الله له في قبره ثلاثمائة باب، تخرج منها حيات وعقارب وثعبان النار، فهو يحترق إلى يوم القيامة، فإذا بعث من قبره تأذى الناس من نتن ريحه، فيعرف بذلك وبما كان يعمل في دار الدنيا، حتى يؤمر به إلى النار. ألا إن الله حرم الحرام، وحد الحدود، وما أحد أغير من الله، ومن غيرته حرم الفواحش، ونهى أن يطلع الرجل في بيت جاره، وقال: من نظر إلى عورة أخيه المسلم  أو عورة غير أهله متعمدا، أدخله الله مع المنافقين الذين كانوا يبحثون عن عورات المسلمين، ولم يخرج من الدنيا حتى يفضحه الله، إلا أن يتوب. وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من لم يرض بما قسم الله له من الرزق، وبث شكواه، ولم يصبر ولم يحتسب، لم ترفع له حسنة، ويلقى الله وهو عليه غضبان، إلا أن يتوب، ونهى أن يختال الرجل في مشيته، وقال: من لبس ثوبا فاختال فيه خسف الله به من شفير جهنم، وكان قرين قارون، لانه أول من اختال فخسف الله به وبداره الارض، ومن اختال فقد نازع الله في جبروته. وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من ظلم امرأة مهرها فهو عند الله زان، يقول الله عز وجل يوم القيامة: عبدي زوجتك أمتي على عهدي، فلم توف بعهدي، وظلمت أمتي، فيؤخذ من حسناته، فيدفع إليها بقدر حقها، فإذا لم تبق له حسنة أمر به إلى النار بنكثه للعهد (إن العهد كان مسئولا) (1). ونهى (صلى الله عليه وآله) عن كتمان الشهادة، وقال: من كتمها أطعمه الله لحمه على رؤوس الخلائق، وهو قول الله عز وجل: (ولا تكتموا الشهادة ومن يكتمها فإنه ءاثم قلبه) (2)، وقال رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله): من آذى جاره حرم الله عليه ريح الجنة، ومأواه جهنم وبئس المصير، ومن ضيع حق جاره فليس منا، وما زال جبرئيل يوصيني بالجار حتى ظننت أنه سيورثه، وما زال يوصيني بالمماليك حتى ظننت أنه سيجعل لهم وقتا إذا بلغوا ذلك الوقت اعتقوا، وما زال يوصيني بالسواك حتى ظننت أنه سيجعله فريضة، وما زال يوصيني بقيام الليل حتى ظننت أن خيار أمتي لن يناموا. ألا ومن استخف بفقير مسلم، فقد استخف بحق الله، والله يستخف به يوم القيامة، إلا أن يتوب، وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من أكرم فقيرا مسلما، لقي الله يوم القيامة وهو عنه راض. وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من عرضت له فاحشة أو شهوة، فاجتنبها من  مخافة الله عز وجل، حرم الله عليه النار، وآمنه من الفزع الاكبر، وأنجز له ما وعده في كتابه، في قوله: (ولمن خاف مقام ربه جنتان) (1). ألا ومن عرضت له دنيا وآخرة، فاختار الدنيا على الآخرة، لقي الله يوم القيامة وليست له حسنة يتقي بها النار، ومن اختار الآخرة على الدنيا (2) رضي الله عنه وغفر له مساوئ عمله، ومن ملا عينه من حرام ملا الله عينه يوم القيامة من النار، إلا أن يتوب ويرجع. وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من صافح امرأة تحرم عليه، فقباء بسخط من الله، ومن التزم امرأة حراما، قرن في سلسلة من النار مع الشيطان، فيقذفان في النار، ومن غش مسلما في شراء أو بيع فليس منا، ويحشر يوم القيامة مع اليهود، لانهم أغش الخلق للمسلمين، ونهى رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) أن يمنع أحد الماعون، وقال: من منع الماعون جاره منعه الله خيره يوم القيامة، ووكله إلى نفسه، ومن وكله إلى نفسه فما أسوأ حاله! وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): أيما امرأة آذت زوجها بلسانها، لم يقبل الله منها صرفا ولا عدلا ولا حسنة من عملها حتى ترضيه، وإن صامت نهارها، وقامت ليلها، واعتقت الرقاب، وحملت على جياد الخيل في سبيل الله، وكانت أول من يرد النار، وكذلك الرجل إذا كان لها ظالما. ألا ومن لطم خد مسلم أو وجهه، بدد الله عظامه يوم القيامة، وحشر مغلولا حتى يدخل جهنم، إلا أن يتوب، ومن بات وفي قلبه غش لاخيه المسلم بات في سخط الله، وأصبح كذلك حتى يتوب. ونهى عن الغيبة، وقال: من اغتاب امرءا مسلما، بطل صومه، ونقض وضوؤه، وجاء يوم القيامة تفوح من فيه رائحة أنتن من الجيفة، يتأذى به أهل الموقف، فإن  مات قبل أن يتوب مات مستحلا لما حرم الله. وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من كظم غيظا وهو قادر على إنفاذه وحلم عنه، أعطاه الله أجر شهيد، ألا ومن تطول على أخيه في غيبة سمعها فيه في مجلس فردها عنه، رد الله عنه ألف باب من السوء في الدنيا والآخرة، فإن هو لم يردها وهو قادر على ردها، كان عليه كوزر من اغتابه سبعين مرة. ونهى رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) عن الخيانة، وقال: من خان أمانة في الدنيا ولم يردها إلى أهلها، ثم أدركه الموت، مات على غير ملتي، ويلقى الله وهو عليه غضبان. وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): من شهد شهادة زور على أحد من الناس، علق بلسانه مع المنافقين في الدرك الاسفل من النار، ومن اشترى خيانة وهو يعلم، فهو كالذي خانها، ومن حبس عن أخيه المسلم شيئا من حق حرم الله عليه بركة الرزق إلا أن يتوب. ألا ومن سمع فاحشة فأفشاها فهو كالذي أتاها، ومن احتاج إليه أخوه المسلم في قرض وهو يقدر عليه، فلم يفعل، حرم الله عليه ريح الجنة. ألا ومن صبر على خلق امرأة سيئة الخلق، واحتسب في ذلك الاجر، أعطاه الله ثواب الشاكرين في الآخرة. ألا وأيما امرأة لم ترفق بزوجها، وحملته على ما لا يقدر عليه وما لا يطيق، لم تقبل منها حسنة، وتلقى الله وهو عليها غضبان. ألا ومن أكرم أخاه المسلم فإنما يكرم الله عز وجل. ونهى رسول الله (صلى الله عليه آله) أن يؤم الرجل قوما إلا بإذنهم، وقال: من أم قوما بإذنهم وهم به راضون، فاقتصد بهم في حضوره، وأحسن صلاته بقيامه وقرائته وركوعه وسجوده وقعوده، فله مثل أجر القوم، ولا ينقص من أجورهم شئ. ألا ومن أم قوما بأمرهم ثم لم يتم بهم الصلاة، ولم يحسن في خشوعه وركوعه وسجوده وقراءته ردت عليه صلاته ولم تجاوز ترقوته، وكانت منزلته كمنزلة إمام جائر معتد، لم يصلح إلى رعية، ولم يقم فيهم بحق، ولا قام فيهم بأمر. وقال: من مشى إلى ذي قرابة بنفسه وماله، ليصل رحمه، أعطاه الله عز وجل أجر مائه شهيد، وله بكل خطوة أربعون ألف حسنة، ويمحى عنه أربعون ألف سيئة، ويرفع له من الدرجات مثل ذلك، وكأنما عبد الله مائة سنة صابرا محتسبا، ومن كفى ضريرا حاجة من حوائج الدنيا، ومشى له فيها حتى يقضي الله له حاجة، أعطاه الله  براءة من النفاق وبراءة من النار، وقضى له سبعين حاجة من حوائج الدنيا، ولا يزال يخوض في رحمة الله عز وجل حتى يرجع. ومن مرض يوما وليلة فلم يشك إلى عواده، بعثه الله يوم القيامة مع خليله إبراهيم خليل الرحمن حتى يجوز الصراط كالبرق اللامع، ومن سعى لمريض في حاجة قضاها أو لم يقضها، خرج من ذنوبه كيوم ولدته أمه، فقال رجل من الانصار: بأبي أنت وأمي يا رسول الله، فإن كان المريض من أهل بيته، أو ليس ذلك أعظم أجرا إذا سعى في حاجة أهل بيته؟ قال: نعم. ألا ومن فرج عن مؤمن كربة من كرب الدنيا، فرج الله عنه اثنتين وسبعين كربة من كرب الآخرة، واثنتين وسبعين كربة من كرب الدنيا أهونها المغص. قال: ومن يبطل على ذي حق حقه، وهو يقدر على أداء حقه، فعليه كل يوم خطيئة عشار، ألا ومن علق سوطا بين يدي سلطان جائر، جعل الله ذلك السوط يوم القيامة ثعبانا من النار طوله سبعون ذراعا، يسلط عليه في نار جهنم وبئس المصير، ومن اصطنع إلى أخيه معروفا فأمتن به، أحبط الله عمله، وثبت وزره، ولم يشكر له سعيه، ثم قال (صلى الله عليه وآله): يقول الله عز وجل: حرمت الجنة على المنان والبخيل والقتات، وهو النمام. ألا ومن تصدق بصدقة، فله بوزن كل درهم مثل جبل أحد من نعيم الجنة، ومن مشى بصدقه إلى محتاج، كان له كأجر صاحبها من غير أن ينقص من أجره شئ، ومن صلى على ميت صلى عليه وسبعون ألف ملك، وغفر الله له ما تقدم من ذنبه، فإن أقام حتى يدفن ويحثي عليه التراب، كان له بكل قدم نقلها قيراط من الاجر، والقيراط مثل جبل أحد. ألا ومن ذرفت عيناه من خشية الله، كان له بكل قطرت قطرت من دموعه قصر في الجنة مكلل بالدر والجوهر، فيه ما لا عين رأت ولا أذن سمعت، ولا خطر على قلب بشر، ألا ومن مشى إلى مسجد يطلب فيه الجماعة، كان له بكل خطوة سبعون ألف حسنة، ويرفع له من الدرجات مثل ذلك، وإن مات وهو على ذلك، وكل الله به سبعين  ألف ملك يعودونه (1) في قبره، ويؤنسونه في وحدته، ويستغفرون له حتى يبعث. ألا ومن أذن محتسبا، يريد بذلك وجه الله عز وجل، أعطاه الله ثواب أربعين ألف شهيد وأربعين ألف صديق، ويدخل في شفاعته أربعون ألف مسئ من أمتي إلى الجنة، ألا وإن المؤذن إذا قال: أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله، صلى عليه تسعون ألف ملك، واستغفروا له، وكان يوم القيامة في ظل العرش حتى يفرغ من حساب الخلائق، ويكتب ثواب قوله: أشهد أن محمدا رسول الله، أربعون ألف ملك، ومن حافظ على الصف الاول، والتكبيرة الاولى، لا يؤذي مسلما، أعطاه الله من الاجر ما يعطى المؤذنون في الدنيا والآخرة. ألا ومن تولى عرافة قوم، حبسه الله عز وجل على شفير جهنم، بكل يوم ألف سنة، وحشر يوم القيامة ويداه مغلولتان إلى عنقه، فإن قام فيهم بأمر الله أطلقه الله، وإن كان ظالما هوى به في نار جهنم وبئس المصير. وقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): لا تحقروا شيئا من الشر، وإن صغر في أعينكم، ولا تستكثروا الخير، وإن كثر في أعينكم، فانه لا كبير مع الاستغفار، ولا صغير مع الاصرار. قال محمد بن زكريا الغلابي، سألت عن طول هذا الاثر شعيبا المزني، فقال لي: يا أبا عبد الله، سألت الحسين بن زيد عن طول هذا الحديث، فقال: حدثني جعفر بن محمد بن علي بن الحسين بن علي بن أبي طالب (عليهم السلام)، أنه جمع هذا الحديث من الكتاب الذي هو إملاء رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) وخط علي بن أبي طالب (عليه السلام) (2).",

He said: “Do not go to the mosque without praying [at least] two units.” He prohibited urination under a fruit tree and at the side of a road. He prohibited eating with the left [hand] and eating while lying down. He prohibited plastering graveyards and praying in them. He said: “When one of you bathes in an expanse of earth, then be mindful of your private. None of you should drink water from the buttonhole of a vessel, for it is a gathering place for dirt.” He prohibited anyone from urinating in still water, for it causes a loss in intellect. He prohibited walking with one sandal and putting on sandals while standing. He prohibited urinating while the private is facing the Sun or the Moon. He said: “When you are defecating, then avoid [the direction of] the qibla.” He prohibited screaming during calamities. He prohibited wailing and listening to wailing. He prohibited women from following funeral processions. He prohibited erasing anything from the Book of Allah with saliva or writing in it. He prohibited lying purposely about dreams. He said: “Allah will order him to tie a knot in a grain of barley.” He prohibited creating images. He said: “Whoever creates an image, Allah will order him to blow [life] into it on the Day of Resurrection; and he would not be able to blow [life] into it.” He prohibited burning a part of an animal [while alive]. He prohibited insulting the rooster. He said: “It calls to prayer.” He prohibited interfering in a deal of his Muslim brother [selling merchandise to a buyer]. He prohibited speaking too much during intercourse. He said: “It causes muteness in the child.” He said: “Do not sleep while garbage is in your house. Take it out during the day, for it is a sitting place for Satan.” He said: “Do not sleep while the residue of meat is on your hand, for if you do that, you will be afflicted with mild insanity from Satan, and you will have no one to blame but yourself.” He prohibited cleaning oneself with dung. He prohibited women from leaving their house without the permission of their husband; for if she leaves, she will be cursed by every angel in heaven and everything that passes it from the Jinn and the humans until she returns to her house.” He prohibited a woman from adorning herself for other than her husband, for if she does that, then it will be a right upon Allah to burn her in the Fire. He prohibited women from saying more than five unnecessary words to those other than their husbands and their relatives. He prohibited women from seeing one another without a robe. He prohibited women from speaking about that which is confidential with regards to their husbands. He prohibited men from having intercourse with their women while facing the qibla or on a paved road, for whoever does that, then the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people will be on him. He prohibited men from telling men: “Marry me to your sister so that I may marry you to my sister.” He prohibited visiting fortune-tellers, and he said: “Whoever meets him and believes in him has dissociated from what Allah has revealed to Muhammad (s).” He prohibited playing with dice, chess, drums, tambourines, and ouds. He prohibited backbiting and listening to it. He prohibited gossiping and listening to it. He said: “A backbiter, meaning a gossiper, will not enter Paradise.” He prohibited responding to an invitation to food from the depraved people (fasiqin). He prohibited bearing false oaths. He said: “It leads to a loss of houses.” He said: “Whoever swears a false oath intending to cut a Muslim person away from his wealth will meet Allah while He is angry with him, unless he repents and recants.” He prohibited sitting at tablespreads where wine is drunk. He prohibited men from bringing their women to bathhouses. He said: “None of you should enter a bathhouse without an izar (a garment that covers the lower part of one's body).” He prohibited conversations that call toward other than Allah. He prohibited slapping the face. He prohibited drinking from a gold or silver vessel. He prohibited men from wearing silk; as for women, then there is no problem. He prohibited selling fruits before they bloom -- meaning, [before they turn] yellow or red. He prohibited selling dates before they ripen and grapes and that which is similar. He prohibited selling dice and chess. He said: “Whoever does that is like one who has eaten pork.” He prohibited selling wine, buying wine, and providing wine. He (as) said: “May Allah curse wine, its presser, its planter, its drinker, its provider, its seller, its buyer, the one who consumes its wealth, its carrier, and the one it is carried to.” He (as) said: “Whoever drinks it, then his prayers are not accepted for forty days. If he dies with something of it in his stomach, then it will be a right on Allah to make him drink his own melted flesh, which is the pus of the people of the Fire, as well as that which comes out of the privates of adulterers. That will be gathered in the pots of Hell, and the people of the Fire will drink from it, and it will melt that which is in their stomachs and their flesh.” He prohibited consuming usury, bearing false witness, and issuing usury. He (as) said: “Surely, Allah curses the consumer of usury, its dealer, its issuer, and the one who witnesses over it.” He prohibited lending on the condition of sale. He prohibited [binding interactions] when a buyer and seller [have not yet separated.] He prohibited selling that which you do not have. He prohibited selling that which cannot be guaranteed. He prohibited shaking hands with the dhimmi. He prohibited the recitation (inshad) of poetry or the recitation of misguidance in the mosque. He prohibited the unsheathing of swords in the mosque. He prohibited striking the faces of animals. He prohibited men from looking at the privates of their Muslim brethren. He said: “Whoever stares at the private of his brother, then seventy thousand angels curse him.” He prohibited women from looking at the privates of women. He prohibited blowing into food or drink or blowing in the place of prostration. He prohibited praying in graveyards, on roads, on roundabouts [that overlook what surround them], in valleys, in camel stalls, and atop the Ka`ba. He prohibited the killing of bees. He prohibited branding the faces of animals. He prohibited swearing on other than Allah. He said: “Whoever swears on other than Allah will have nothing to do with Allah.” He prohibited swearing on a chapter from the Book of Allah. He said: “Whoever swears on a chapter from the Book of Allah must fulfill [the expiation of an unfulfilled] oath – whoever wishes will abide by it, and whoever wishes will disobey.” He prohibited the saying of a man to a man: “No, by your life, and by the life of so-and-so.” He prohibited sitting in the mosque in a state of sexual impurity. He prohibited nudity at night and in the day. He prohibited cupping (hijama) on Wednesdays and Fridays. He prohibited speaking while the imam is delivering a sermon on Friday – whoever does that has made chatter, and whoever makes chatter will have no Friday [prayer recorded] for him. He prohibited wearing gold and iron rings. He prohibited etching something from the animals on the ring. He prohibited praying at three timings: (1) at sunrise, (2) at sunset, and (3) at its zenith. He prohibited fasting on six days: (1) the day of Fitr, (2) the day of doubt (when it is unsure whether it is Ramadan or Eid), (3) the day of sacrifice (Eid al-Adha), and (4-6) the days of tashriq. He prohibited sipping water in the way animals drink. He said: “Drink with your hands, for they are the best of your utensils.” He prohibited spitting in the wells that are drunk from. He prohibited hiring a worker before knowing what his wage is. He prohibited ignoring [a person]; and if he must do so, then he cannot ignore his brother for more than three days. Whoever ignores his brother for longer than that, then the Fire is most rightful to him. He prohibited selling gold and silver at one price. He prohibited selling gold for more gold except that which is equal in weight. He prohibited overpraising [others]. He said: “Throw dust in the faces of those who overpraise.” He (s) said: “Whoever supports the argument of an oppressor or supports him in it, when the Angel of Death comes down to him, it will say to him: ‘I give you tidings of the curse of Allah and the Fire of Hell in the misery of fate.’ Whoever praises a tyrannical leader and eases him and incites him for his own benefit, he will follow him into the Fire.” He (s) said: “Allah says, ‘And do not be inclined to the oppressors or you will be touched by the Fire.’ (11:113)”\r\nHe (s) said: “Whoever recites the Quran, then drinks something forbidden, or was affected by love of this world and its frills, will have made the indignation of Allah obligatory on himself, unless he repents. If he dies without repenting, then he will have deserted the Quran on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be invalidated.” Surely, whoever commits adultery with a Muslim woman, a Jewish woman, a Christian woman, or a Zoroastrian woman, free or bond, and does not repent, and dies insistent on that, Allah will open three hundred gates to his grave, from which snakes, scorpions, and serpents of the Fire will come through. He will burn until the Day of Resurrection. When he is resurrected from his grave, the people will seek refuge from the stench of his smell, and he will be recognized for that and for what he did in the abode of this world, until he is sent to the Fire. Surely, it is Allah that forbade the forbidden and set the penalties (or limits), and not one other than Allah. It is none but He who forbade immoral actions. He prohibited looking into the house one’s neighbour. He said: “Whoever intentionally looks at the private of his Muslim brother or the private of one from outside his family, Allah will include him among the hypocrites who would implore about the privates of Muslims. He will not come out of this world until Allah exposes him unless he repents.” He (s) said: “Whoever is not pleased with what Allah allotted for him of sustenance, and broadcasts his complaints, and does not exercise patience and consideration, his good deeds will not be raised up. He will meet Allah while He is angry unless he repents.” He prohibited strutting while walking. He said: “Whoever wears a robe and struts in it, Allah will take him to the edge of Hell. He will follow Qarun because he was the first who strutted about his house on Earth. Whoever struts has challenged Allah in His might.” He (s) said: “Whoever oppresses a woman of her dowry is considered by Allah to be an adulterer. Allah will say to him on the Day of Resurrection: ‘My servant! I have married you to My maidservant upon My covenant, but you did not fulfill My covenant. You have oppressed My maidservant.’ So, she will take from his good deeds in proportion to what is owed to her. If he does not have enough good deeds, he will be ordered to the Fire, having abandoned the covenant. ‘Surely, you will be accounted for your covenant.’ (17:34)” He (s) prohibited concealing testimonies. He said: “Whoever conceals it, Allah will feed his flesh to the heads of creatures.” That is the saying of Allah, “Do not conceal the testimony, for whoever conceals it, their hearts are surely sinful.” (2:283) The Messenger of Allah (s) said: “Whoever harms his neighbour, Allah forbids the fragrance of Paradise from him, and his place will be in Hell in the misery of fate. Whoever squanders the right of his neighbour is not of us. Gabriel has not stopped advising me about the neighbour, to the point where I thought that he would also inherit. He has not stopped advising me about the slaves, to the point where I thought that they would be freed once they reached a certain time. He did not stop advising me about the toothstick, to the point where I thought that he would make it an obligation. He did not stop advising me about standing at night in prayer, to the point where I thought that the best of my Nation would not sleep. Surely, whoever does not take the affairs of a poor Muslim seriously, Allah will not take his rights seriously, and Allah will not take his affairs seriously on the Day of Resurrection, unless he repents.” He (s) said: “Whoever is generous to a poor Muslim, he will meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection, and He will be pleased with him.” He (s) said: “Whoever is presented with an indecency or a temptation and avoids them out of the fear of Allah, Allah will forbid the Fire from him. He will safeguard him from the Great Dismay, and He will reward him with what He promised in His Book, in His saying, ‘For he who fears standing before his Lord is two gardens.’ (55:46)” Surely, whoever is presented with this world and the Hereafter, and he chooses this world over the Hereafter, he will meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection without a good deed to prevent him from the Fire. Whoever chooses the Hereafter over this world, Allah will be pleased with him, and He will forgive him of his sinful actions. Whoever fills his eye with forbidden things, Allah will fill his eye with fire on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever attaches himself to a woman that is forbidden to him, he will be in a ring of fire with Satan, and they will be cast into the Fire. Whoever cheats a Muslim in buying or selling is not of us, and he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection with the Jews, because they cheat the Muslims the most among the creation. The Messenger of Allah (s) prohibited depriving anyone of kindness. He said: “Whoever deprives his neighbour of kindness, Allah will deprive him of His goodness on the Day of Resurrection. He will assign him to himself, and whoever is assigned to himself will be in the worst condition!” He (s) said: “When a woman harms her husband with her tongue, Allah does not accept her compulsory, voluntary, or good deeds until she pleases him; even if she fasts during the day, prays during the night, frees slaves, and mounts a horse [to fight] in the cause of Allah, she will be the first to be sent to the Fire. It is the same for the man if was oppressive toward her.” Surely, whoever strikes the cheek or the face of a Muslim, Allah will scatter his bones on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be resurrected chained up until he enters Hell, unless he repents. Whoever goes to sleep while having cheated his brother in his heart has slept upon the indignation of Allah and will awake thereupon until he repents. He prohibited backbiting. \r\nHe said: “Whoever backbites a Muslim person will have invalidated his fasting and cancelled out his ablution. He will be brought on the Day of Resurrection smelling like a corpse. His smell will harm the people of the stand. If he dies before he repents, he will die allowing that which was forbidden by Allah.” He (s) said: “Whoever forbears an oppression while he is capable of enforcing [his right], Allah gives him the reward of a martyr.” Surely, whoever refutes the backbiting of his brother in a gathering, Allah repels seventy gates of harm from him in this world and the Hereafter. If he does not refute it while he is able to, then he will have the sin of one who backbites seventy times. The Messenger of Allah (s) prohibited betrayal. He said: “Whoever betrays a trust in this world and does not give it to its rightful owner, then dies, will have died upon a creed other than mine. He will meet Allah while He is angry.” He (s) said: “Whoever bears false witness over one of the people, his tongue will be hung with the hypocrites in the lowest depth of the Fire.” Whoever knowingly hires a betrayer, then he is like the betrayer. Whoever withholds a right of his Muslim brother, Allah will forbid the blessing of sustenance from him, unless he repents. Surely, whoever hears of an indecency and spreads it, then he is like the one that did it. Whoever is approached by his Muslim brother for a loan, and he is capable of giving it but he does not, Allah will forbid the fragrance of Paradise from him. Whoever exercises patience over the poor manners of a woman, seeking a reward [from Allah], Allah will give him the rewards of the thankful in the Hereafter. Surely, if a woman is not compassionate with her spouse, and she makes him do that which he cannot handle, her good deeds will not be accepted, and she will meet Allah while He is angry. Surely, whoever is generous to his Muslim brother is being generous to Allah. The Messenger of Allah (s) prohibited leading a community [in prayer] without their permission. He said: “Whoever leads a community and they are pleased with him, and he gives them his time, and beautifies his prayer in his standing, his recitation, his bowing, his prostration, and his sitting, then he will have a reward like that of the community without decreasing anything of their reward. Surely, whoever leads a community and does not perfect his prayer with him, and does not beautify his humility [before Allah], his bowing, his prostration, and his recitation, his prayer will be rejected and it will not rise above his position. His status will be like that of an oppressive and aggressive leader that cannot rectify his flock and cannot establish any right in them and did not establish an order in them.” He said: “Whoever walks to his relative with his self and his wealth to connect his blood ties, Allah gives him the reward of one hundred martyrs. He will be given one thousand good deeds for every step that he takes, and forty thousand sins will be erased from him, and he will be raised in rank in proportion to that. It will be as though he worshiped Allah for one hundred years in patience and anticipation.\r\nWhoever takes up a need of a blind person and continues until Allah fulfills the need for him, Allah will dissociate him from hypocrisy and dissociate him from the Fire; and He will fulfill seventy needs for him from the needs of this world, and he will remain in the mercy of Allah until he returns [to Allah]. Whoever becomes ill for a day and a night and does not complain to his visitors, Allah raises him on the Day of Resurrection with His Friend Ibrahim the Friend of the Merciful, until he passes through the Path like a bolt of lightening. Whoever goes intending to fulfill a need for an ill person, and fulfills it or does not fulfill it, he will come out of his sins [and be sinless] like the day his mother gave birth to him.”\r\nSo, a man from the Ansar said: “May my mother and my father be your sacrifice, O Messenger of Allah! If the ill person were from his family, is there not a greater reward for him who strives to fulfill a need for his family?” He said: “Yes. Surely, whoever relieves a believer of a burden from the burdens of this world, Allah relieves him of seventy-two burdens from the burdens of the Hereafter, and He relieves him of the pain of seventy-two burdens of this world.” He said: “Whoever invalidates the right of a rightful person when he is capable of fulfilling his need will have tens of sins every day. Surely, whoever whips [a person] in front of a tyrant, Allah will make that whip into a serpent of fire that will be seventy cubits long, and he will be whipped with it in the Fire in the misery of fate. Whoever constrains a good from coming to his brother, Allah invalidates his deeds, makes his sin resolute, and does not thank him for his endeavour.”\r\nThen, he (s) said: “Allah says: ‘Paradise is forbidden for one who is wealthy yet stingy; as well as for the backbiter, who is the gossiper.’ Surely, whoever gives in charity, each silver coin that he gives will be a blessing in Paradise, the weight of each of which is like that of Mount Uhud. Whoever brings a charity [of someone else] to a needy person, he will have the reward of the owner [of the charity] without decreasing a thing of his reward. Whoever prays over a deceased person, seventy-thousand angels will pray over him, and Allah will forgive all his past sins. Whoever attends [the funeral] until he is buried and dirt is thrown onto him, he will be rewarded with a carat for each step that he took; each carat will be like Mount Uhud. Surely, whoever sheds a tear in humility before Allah, he will have a palace in Paradise for each tear, decked with pearl and jewels – in it will be that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human heart has imagined. \r\nSurely, whoever goes to the mosque seeking congregational prayer will receive seventy thousand good deeds with each step, and he will be raised in rank in proportion to that. If he dies while doing that, Allah will assign one thousand angels to visit him in his grave. They will bring comfort to him in his solitude, and they will seek forgiveness on his behalf until he is resurrected. Surely, whoever gives the call to prayer in anticipation, seeking the face of Allah with it, Allah will grant him the reward of forty thousand martyrs and forty thousand saints. His intercession will encompass forty thousand people from my Nation, and they will go to Paradise. Surely, when the mu’adhin says: ‘I bear witness that there is no god but Allah’, ninety thousand angels will bless him and ask for forgiveness on his behalf. On the Day of Resurrection, he will be in the shade of the Throne until the creatures are finished with the judgment. When he says: ‘I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah’, forty thousand angels will record his deeds. Whoever secures the first row and the first takbir, and does not harm a Muslim, Allah will reward him with that which is given to the mu’adhins in this world and the Hereafter. Surely, whoever aligns with a fortune-teller, Allah will imprison him at the edge of Hell. For every day [he went, he will be there for] one thousand years. He will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment with his hands chained to his neck. When he stands to be judged by Allah, Allah will cast him away. If he was oppressive, he will be sent to the Fire in the misery of fate.”\r\nHe (s) said: “Do not underestimate evil, not matter how small it is in your eyes, and do not overestimate goodness, no matter how much of it is in your eyes. There is nothing too big for repentance, and there is nothing too small for persistence.”\r\nMuhammad b. Zakariyya al-Ghilabi said: I asked Shu`ayb al-Muzni (the narrator) about the length of this report, so he said to me: O Aba `Abdillah! I asked al-Husayn b. Zayd about the length of this hadith, so he said: Ja`far b. Muhammad b. `Ali b. al-Husayn b. `Ali b. Abi Talib (as) narrated to me that he gathered this hadith from a book that was the dictations of the Messenger of Allah (s) and the handwriting of `Ali b. Abi Talib (as).",

    "englishText": "Abu Ja`far Muhammad b. `Ali b. al-Husayn b. Musa b. Babuwayh al-Qummi (rh) narrated to us. He said: `Ali b. al-Husayn b. Shadhuwayh al-Mu’addab and Ja`far b. Muhammad b. Masrur (ra) narrated to us. They said: Muhammad b. `Abdullah b. Ja`far al-Himyari narrated to us from his father from al-Rayyan b. al-Salt. He said: Al-Rida (as) attended a gathering with al-Ma’mun in Marv, who had gathered a group of scholars from the people of Iraq and Khurasan. So, al-Ma’mun said: Inform me of the meaning of this verse, “Then, We bequeathed the Book to Our chosen servants.” (35:32) So, the scholars said: By this, Allah meant this entire Nation (Umma). So, al-Ma’mun said: What do you say, Aba’l Hasan? So, al-Rida (as) said: I do not say as they have said, but rather I say: Allah meant the pure progeny (al-`itra al-tahira). So, al-Ma’mun said: How could have He meant the progeny without the Nation? So, al-Rida (as) said to him: Had He meant the Nation, then it would be going to Paradise in its entirety, as per the saying of Allah, “Some of them wrong themselves, some follow a middle course, and some are foremost in good deeds by the permission of Allah. That is the greatest bounty.” (35:32) Then, He included all of them in Paradise, saying, “They will enter the Gardens of Eternity, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold” (35:33). Therefore, the bequeathal is to the pure progeny, not to others. Then, al-Ma’mun said: Who are the pure progeny? So, al-Rida (as) said: Those whom Allah described in His Book. \u003Cbr\u003E He says, “Surely, Allah only wishes to remove uncleanliness from you, O Ahl al-Bayt, and purify you with a thorough purification.” (33:33) They are the ones about whom the Messenger of Allah (s) said: “Surely, I leave behind the two heavyweights among you: (1) the Book of Allah, and (2) my progeny, my Ahl al-Bayt. Surely, they will not separate until they return to me at the Pond. So, watch how you handle them after me. O people! Do not teach them, for they know more than you.” The scholars said: Inform us, Aba’l Hasan, about the progeny – are they the Family (al-Aal) or are they different than the Family? So, al-Rida (as) said: They are the Family. So, the scholars said: It is reported that the Messenger of Allah (s) said: “My Nation is my Family.” His companions have thoroughly reported that the Family of Muhammad is his Nation, to a point where it cannot be denied. So, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Inform me: is charity not forbidden for the Family? They said: Yes. He said: So, is it forbidden for the Nation? They said: No. He said: This is a difference that distinguishes the Family from the Nation. Woe to you for where you have been taken to! Have you deviated from the remembrance of the page (the Quran)? Are you an extravagant people?! Do you not know that [these verses on] bequeathal and purity apply to the chosen, guided ones and not the rest of you? They said: From where [did you read this], Aba’l Hasan? He said: From the saying of Allah, “We have sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and We have placed prophethood and the Book in their descendants. Among them are those who are guided, but many of them are transgressors.” (57:26) The inheritors of prophethood and the Book went to those who are guided, not the transgressors. Do you not know that, when Nuh (as) asked his Lord, “So, he said: My Lord! Surely, my son is from my family, and surely, Your promise is true, and You are the most just of the judges.” (11:45) That was when Allah promised to save him and his family. So, his Lord said to him, “O Nuh! He is not of your family. Surely, he is one whose work was other than righteous; so do not ask about that which you have no knowledge of. I exhort you from being of the ignorant.” (11:46) Then, al-Ma’mun said: Has Allah favoured the progeny over the rest of the people? So, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Surely, Allah demonstrated the favour of the progeny over the rest of the people in the decisive [verses] of His Book. \u003Cbr\u003E So, al-Ma’mun said to him: Where is that in the Book of Allah? So, a-Rida (as) said: In His saying, “Surely, Allah has chosen Adam, Nuh, the Family of Ibrahim, and the Family of `Imran over the people. Offspring, one of the other.” (3:33-34) He said in another place, “Do they envy what Allah has given them of His favour? We have given the Family of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them great authority.” (4:54) Then, He proceeded to address the rest of the believers in context to this, “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and the Masters of Authority among” (4:59) – meaning, those whom We bestowed with the Book and the wisdom, and they were envied upon that. So, His saying, “Do they envy what Allah has given them of His favour? We have given the Family of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them great authority” (4:54) refers to obedience to the chosen and pure ones. Authority here refers to obedience to them. The scholars said: Inform us: Has Allah explained chosenness in His Book? \u003Cbr\u003E So, al-Rida (as) said: He explained this chosenness in twelve apparent places, not including [any] esoteric [places]. The first of those is His saying, “Warn your closest relatives *and your chosen group*” (26:214) – this is in the recitation of Ubay b. Ka`b, and it is firm in the codex of `Abdullah b. Mas`ud. This is an elevated rank, a great favour, and an exalted honour that Allah used when referring to this Family. He mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (s) – and this is the first [verse]. The second verse in relation to chosenness is His saying, “Surely, Allah only wishes to remove uncleanliness from you, O Ahl al-Bayt, and purify you with a thorough purification.” (33:33) This is a favour that no stubborn person is ignorant of, because favour comes after purity.  As for the third, it is when Allah distinguished the pure ones from His creation and ordered His Prophet to the imprecation (mubahala) in the Verse of Imprecation. He said: Say, O Muhammad, “Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, our selves and your selves. Then, we will imprecate, and we will put the curse of Allah over the liars.” (3:61) \u003Cbr\u003E So, the Prophet (s) honoured `Ali, al-Hasan, al-Husayn, and Fatima (s) and compared their selves to his self. Do you comprehend the meaning of His saying, “our selves and your selves”? The scholars said: It means themselves. \u003Cbr\u003E So, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: You are incorrect. Surely, it only refers to `Ali b. Abi Talib (as). The saying of the Prophet (s) indicates this when he said: “Banu Wali`a will stop or I will send them a man like myself” – meaning, `Ali b. Abi Talib (as). This specifically [is a virtue] that none surpass him in, and a favour that no human will follow him in, and an honour that no creature preceded him in; that he positioned `Ali to his own self – this is the third.  As for the fourth: he (s) ordered the people to leave his Mosque with exception to the progeny. The people talked about that, and [even] al-`Abbas [b. `Abd al-Muttalib] talked about it. He said: “O Messenger of Allah! You have left `Ali and you have ordered us to leave!” \u003Cbr\u003E So, the Messenger of Allah (s) said: “It was not I who left him and ordered you to leave, but rather it was Allah that left him and ordered you to leave.” In this is an elucidation of his saying to `Ali (as): “You are to me as Harun was to Musa.” The scholars said: Where is this in the Quran? Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Shall I bring it to you from the Quran and recite it to you? They said: Bring it. He said: The saying of Allah, “We revealed to Musa and his brother: settle your people in houses in Egypt and make your houses the qibla.” (10:87) In this verse is the status of Harun to Musa, and likewise therein is the status of `Ali (as) to the Messenger of Allah (s). From this is a clear indication regarding the saying of the Messenger of Allah (s) when he said: “Surely, none can be in a state of janaba in this Mosque except Muhammad and his Family.” \u003Cbr\u003E So, the scholars said: O Aba’l Hasan! This interpretation and elucidation is not found except with you, the Ahl al-Bayt of the Messenger of Allah (s). So, he said: Who denies that of us? The Messenger of Allah (s) said: “I am the City of Wisdom and `Ali is its Gate, so whoever wants the City must come to it by its Gate.” We have clarified and explained this favour, honour, pre-eminence, chosenness, and purity in a way that cannot be denied by a stubborn person; and praise be to Allah for that – this is the fourth. The fifth verse is the saying of Allah, “Give those near in kin their right” (17:26) – Allah the Glorious and Powerful specified them in it, and He chose them over the Nation. When this verse was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (s), he said: “Call to Fatima for me.” \u003Cbr\u003E So, she was called for him, then he said: “O Fatima!” She said: “I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah.” So, he (s) said: “Fadak is that which no horse nor camel rushed upon [to seize]. It belongs to me alone and not the Muslims. I have given it to you when Allah commanded me to. So, take it for yourself and your children” – this is the fifth. The sixth verse is the saying of Allah, “Say: I do not ask you for a reward for it except to love those near in kin.” (42:23) This is specifically for the Prophet (s) until the Day of Resurrection, and specifically to the Family and not anyone else. This is because Allah reported what Nuh (as) had said in His Book, “And O my people, I ask not of you for it any wealth. My reward is not but from Allah. And I am not one to drive away those who have believed. Surely, they will meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly.” (11:29) He reported what Hud (as) had said, “I do not ask you for any reward. My reward is only from the one who created me. Do you, then, not understand?” (11:51) He said to His Prophet (s), “Say” – O Muhammad – “I do not ask you for a reward for it except to love those near in kin.” (42:23) Allah would not obligate their love without knowing that they will not ever apostate from the religion, nor will they ever go back to misguidance. A man may love a man, but if he is an enemy to a family member of his, the man’s heart will not be at peace with him. \u003Cbr\u003E So, Allah did not want anything of malice in the heart of the Messenger of Allah (s) for the believers, thus he obligated loving those near in kin. Whoever fulfills this, loves the Messenger of Allah (s), and loves his Ahl al-Bayt, the Messenger of Allah (s) will not be able to hate him; but whoever abandons this, and does not fulfill it, and hates his Ahl al-Bayt, then it is incumbent on the Messenger of Allah (s) to hate him, for he will have abandoned an obligation set by Allah. \u003Cbr\u003E So, what favour and what honour supersedes or [even] comes close to this? When Allah revealed this verse upon His Prophet (s), “Say: I do not ask you for a reward for it except to love those near in kin.” (42:23), the Messenger of Allah (s) stood among his companions, praised Allah and commended Him, and said: “O people! Allah has obligated something for me upon you. Will you fulfill it?” None answered him. Then, he said: “O people! It is not [something fulfilled] by gold, silver, food, or drink. \u003Cbr\u003E So, they said: “Give it.” So, he recited this verse, and they said: “As for this, then yes.” However, most of them did not fulfill it. Allah did not send a prophet except that he revealed to him that he is to not ask for a reward from his people, because Allah fulfills the reward of the prophets. For Muhammad (s), Allah obligated the love for his kin for his Nation, and He commanded him to make his reward with them their love for him through his relatives. [This can only be] by recognizing their favour, which Allah obligated for them, for love can only be at the level of recognition of their favour. When Allah obligated this, it was as heavy as the obligation of obeying them. Some who took a covenant with Allah held onto this to fulfill the promise, but the people of discord and hypocrisy were stubborn and disbelieved in it. They took it beyond the limit that Allah limited it with, and they said: “The kin are all the Arabs and the people he called to.” Upon this, the two opinions came about. We know that the love is for the related, and the most related of them to the Prophet (s) is the most rightful of them to the love. The closer the relation is, the more love is in proportion to it. They were unjust to the Prophet of Allah (s) in honouring him and being affectionate to him and that which Allah [obligated] his Nation with regards to him and thanking him in a way that tongues cannot describe. They did not love him through his descendants and his Ahl al-Bayt, and they did not confer a status to them like that of the eye to the head, as a trust to the Messenger of Allah (s) and out of love for His Prophet. How is this when the Quran speaks about it and calls to it? The reports are sound that they are the people of this love, and they are the ones whose love Allah obligated. He promised the reward upon this – there is not one sincere, believing person in this love except that Paradise becomes obligatory for him, as per the saying of Allah in this verse, “And those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens [in Paradise] having whatever they will in the presence of their Lord. That is what is the great bounty. That is the good news that Allah gives to His servants who believed and did righteous deeds. Say, “I do not ask you any fee for it, except the love of kinship” (42:22-23) – interpreted and clarified. Then, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: My father narrated to me from my grandfather from his forefathers from al-Husayn b. `Ali (as). He said: The Muhajirin and the Ansar gathered to the Messenger of Allah (s) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, you have difficulties and expenses with regards to those who visit you. Here is our wealth and our blood, so manage it how you will in righteousness and reward – give what you wish and withhold what you wish, regardless of any need.” He said: So, Allah sent the Trustworthy Spirit down to him, who said: “O Muhammad! ‘Say: I do not ask you for a reward for it except to love those near in kin.’ (42:23)” – meaning, love my kin after me. \u003Cbr\u003E So, they left. The hypocrites said: “The Messenger of Allah (s) did not abandon what we have presented to him except to urge us [to accept] his kin after him. It is but something that he concocted in his sitting place.” That was a great calumny of theirs, so Allah revealed this verse to Gabriel, “Or do they say that he concocted it? Say: ‘If I have done so, then there is nothing whatsoever you can do to save me from Allah. He knows best what you indulge about it. Sufficient is He as a Witness between you and me. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’” (46:8) \u003Cbr\u003E So, the Prophet (s) sent for them and said: “Did anyone say anything?” They said: “Yes, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah. Some of us said repugnant words that we hated.” So, the Messenger of Allah (s) recited the verse to them, and they wept, and their weeping intensified. Then, Allah revealed, “It is He who accepts repentance from His servants and forgives sins and knows what they do.” (42:25) So, this is the sixth. As for the seventh verse, it is the saying of Allah, “Surely, Allah and His angels bless the Prophet. O you who believe! Bless him and bid peace.” (33:56) Those who were stubborn of them became known when this verse was revealed; it was said: “O Messenger of Allah! We know how to bid you peace (taslim), but how do we bless you?” \u003Cbr\u003E So, he said: “You say: ‘O Allah, bless Muhammad and the Family of Muhammad just as You blessed Ibrahim and the Family of Ibrahim. Surely, You are the Praiseworthy, the Great.’” O people! So, is there any among you who disagrees with this? They said: No. Al-Ma’mun said: There is no disagreement in this anyway, as there is a consensus on it. Do you have anything clearer than this in the Quran about the Family [in particular]? Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Yes. Inform me of the saying of Allah, “Yasin. By the Wise Quran, surely, you are of the messengers, upon a Straight Path.” (36:1-4) What did He mean when He said, “Yasin”? The scholars said: Yasin is Muhammad (s). No one doubts this. Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Surely, Allah has granted Muhammad (s) and the Family of Muhammad a favour that none can comprehend or describe except one who intelligizes it: Allah does not give salaam to anyone [in the Quran] except the prophets (as). He says, “Peace be with Nuh among the worlds” (37:79), and He says, “Peace be with Ibrahim” (37:109), and He says, “Peace be with Musa and Harun” (37:120), but He did not say: “Peace be with the Family of Nuh”, nor did He say: “Peace be with the Family of Musa” nor “with the Family of Ibrahim” – yet He says, “Peace be with the Family of Yasin” (37:130), meaning the Family of Muhammad (s). Then, al-Ma’mun said: I knew that in the goldmine of prophethood there was an explanation and clarification of this – so this is the seventh. As for the eighth, Allah says, “Know that when you gain a thing, then a fifth of it is for Allah, the Messenger, and those near of kin.” (8:41), so He compared the portion of those near of kin to His portion and His Messenger’s portion. This is another difference between the Family and the Nation because Allah placed them in a position and placed the people in another position. He willed for them what He willed for Himself, and He chose them therein. He began with Himself, then His Messenger, then those near of kin in regard to the fay’, the spoils, and other than that, decreeing for them what He decreed for Himself and for them. He says, and His saying is true, “Know that when you gain a thing, then a fifth of it is for Allah, the Messenger, and those near of kin.” (8:41) This is a steadfast guarantee and a standing decree for them until the Day of Resurrection, [written] in the Speaking Book of Allah; which falsehood cannot come to before it or behind it, revealed by the Wise, the Praiseworthy. As for His saying, “and the orphans and the poor” (8:41), when the orphan matures, he does not receive the khums and he does not have a right to it. It is the same with the poor: if his poverty goes, then he will not have a right to the khums, and it will not be permissible to take. The portion of those near in kin is established for them until the Day of Resurrection, whether they are wealthy or poor. There is none wealthier than Allah nor His Messenger (s), so He set a portion for Himself and His Messenger. Whatever He willed for Himself and His Messenger, He willed for them. It is the same with the fay’: what He willed for Himself and His Prophet, He willed for those near in kin. He began with Himself, then His Messenger, then them; and He compared their portion with Allah’s portion and His Messenger’s portion. It is like that in obedience – He says, “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and the Masters of Authority among” (4:59) – He began with Himself, then His Messenger, then his Ah al-Bayt. It is like that in the Verse of Wilaya, “Surely, your wali is only Allah, His Messenger, and those who believe …” (5:55) \u003Cbr\u003E So, He made their wilaya, alongside the obedience owed to the Messenger, like the obedience owed to Him; just as He made their portion alongside the portion of the Messenger like His portion in the spoils and the fay’. May Allah be glorified and exalted for making His blessing over this Ahl al-Bayt great! When the delineation for charity came, He exempted Himself, His Messenger, and his Ahl al-Bayt. He says, “Surely, charity is only for the poor, the needy, those employed to collect it, those whose hearts are attracted [to Islam], for freeing slaves, for those in debt, for Allah’s cause, and for wayfarers. This is obligated by Allah.” (9:60) Do you see anything in this that is apportioned for Himself, His Messenger, or those near of kin? Because when He exempted Himself, His Messenger, and His Ahl al-Bayt from charity, He forbade it for them, for charity is forbidden for Muhammad and His Family. It is the impure [wealth] that is in the hands of the people, and it is forbidden for them, because they are purified from every uncleanliness and dirtiness. When Allah purified and chose them, He willed for them what He willed for Himself, and He disliked for them what He disliked for Himself. So, this is the eighth. As for the ninth: we are the People of the Reminder (Ahl al-Dhikr) about whom Allah says in the decisive [verse] of His Book, “So, ask the People of the Reminder if you do not know.” (16:43) The scholars said: With this, He means the Jews and the Christians. So, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: May Allah be glorified! Is that permissible? They would call us to their religion, and say that it is better than the religion of Islam. Al-Ma’mun said: Do you have an interpretation that opposes what they have said, Aba’l Hasan? So, he (as) said: Yes. The Reminder is the Messenger of Allah (s), and we are his family (ahl). That is clarified in the Book of Allah where He says in Surat al-Talaq, “Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them. \u003Cbr\u003E So, fear Allah, O people of intellect and belief. Allah has bestowed a Reminder unto you; a messenger reciting Allah’s revelation to you, making things clear” (65:10-11) The Reminder is the Messenger of Allah, and we are his family, so this is the ninth. As for the tenth: it is the saying of Allah in the Verse of Prohibition, “Forbidden to you for marriage are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters …” (4:23) – to the end of the verse. \u003Cbr\u003E So, inform me: had the Messenger of Allah (s) been alive, would he be able to marry my daughter or the daughter of my son from the progeny of the Messenger of Allah (s)? They said: No. He said: So, inform me: had the Messenger of Allah (s) been alive, would he be able to marry your daughter or the daughter of your son? They said: Yes. He said: In this is a sign, for I am from his Family, and you are not from his Family. Had you been from the Family, then he would have been prohibited from your daughters just as he is prohibited from my daughters, because I am from his Family and you are from his Nation. \u003Cbr\u003E So, this is a difference between the Family and the Nation, because the Family is from him, and the Nation – those who are not from the Family – are not from him. \u003Cbr\u003E So, this is the tenth. As for the eleventh: it is the saying of Allah in Surat al-Mu’min, which speaks about a believing man from the Family of Pharaoh, “A believing man from Pharaoh’s Family, who was hiding his faith, argued, ‘Will you kill a man for saying: My Lord is Allah, while he has in fact come to you with clear proofs from your Lord? …’” (40:28) – to the end of the verse. He was maternal cousin of Pharaoh. He is related to Pharaoh in lineage but not in religion [and was called his Family member]. This is how we were specified as being part of the Family of the Messenger of Allah (s) through our birth from him. We are of the same religion as the people, but this is a distinction between the Family and the Nation. \u003Cbr\u003E  So, this is the eleventh. As for the twelfth: it is the saying of Allah, “And enjoin prayer upon your family and be steadfast therein.” (20:132) Allah specified us in particular. He ordered us to establish prayer along with the Nation, then He specified us without the Nation. The Messenger of Allah (s) would come to the door of `Ali and Fatima for nine months after this verse was revealed, at the call to the five daily prayers. He would say: “The prayer – may Allah have mercy on you.” Allah did not honour anyone of the descendants of the prophets in the way that He honoured us; and he specified us among all the people of his household. \u003Cbr\u003E So, al-Ma’mun and the scholars said: On behalf of this Nation, may Allah reward you, the Ahl al-Bayt of your Prophet, with goodness. We did not find an explanation or an elucidation to quell our doubts except with you.",
    "arabicText": "1 - حدثنا الشيخ الجليل أبو جعفر محمد بن علي بن الحسين بن موسى ابن بابويه القمي (رحمه الله)، قال: حدثنا علي بن الحسين بن شاذويه المؤدب وجعفر بن محمد بن مسرور (رضي الله عنهما)، قالا: حدثنا محمد بن عبد الله بن جعفر الحميري، عن أبيه، عن الريان بن الصلت، قال: حضر الرضا (عليه السلام) مجلس المأمون بمرو، وقد اجتمع في مجلسه جماعة من علماء أهل العراق والخراسان، فقال المأمون: أخبروني عن معنى هذه الآية (ثم أورثنا الكتاب الذين اصطفينا من عبادنا) (1). فقالت العلماء: أراد الله عز وجل بذلك الامة كلها. فقال المأمون: ما تقول، يا أبا الحسن؟ فقال الرضا (عليه السلام): لا أقول كما قالوا، ولكني أقول: أراد الله العترة الطاهرة. فقال المأمون: وكيف عنى العترة من دون الامة؟ فقال له الرضا (عليه السلام): إنه لو أراد الامة لكانت بأجمعها في الجنة، لقول الله تبارك وتعالى: (فمنهم ظالم لنفسه  ومنهم مقتصد ومنهم سابق بالخيرات بإذن الله ذلك هو الفضل الكبير) (1) ثم جمعهم كلهم في الجنة فقال: (جنات عدن يدخلونها يحلون فيها من أساور من ذهب) (2) فصارت الوراثة للعترة الطاهرة لا لغيرهم. فقال المأمون: من العترة الطاهرة؟ فقال الرضا (عليه السلام): الذين وصفهم الله في كتابه، فقال عز وجل: (إنما يريد الله ليذهب عنكم الرجس أهل البيت ويطهركم تطهيرا) (3)، وهم الذين قال رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله): إني مخلف فيكم الثقلين، كتاب الله، وعترتي أهل بيتي، وإنهما لن يفترقا حتى يردا علي الحوض، فانظروا كيف تخلفوني فيهما، أيها الناس لا تعلموهم فإنهم أعلم منكم. قالت العلماء: أخبرنا - يا أبا الحسن - عن العترة، أهم الآل، أو غير الآل؟ فقال الرضا (عليه السلام): هم الآل. فقال العلماء: فهذا رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) يؤثر عنه أنه قال: امتي آلي. وهؤلاء أصحابه يقولون بالخبر المستفاض الذي لا يمكن دفعه: آل محمد امته. فقال أبو الحسن (عليه السلام): أخبروني هل تحرم الصدقة على الآل؟ قالوا: نعم. قال: فتحرم على الامة؟ قالوا: لا. قال: هذا فرق ما بين الآل والامة، ويحكم أين يذهب بكم، أضربتم عن الذكر صفحا، أم أنتم قوم مسرفون! أما علمتم أنه وقعت الوارثة والطهارة على المصطفين المهتدين دون سائرهم؟ قالوا: ومن أين يا أبا الحسن؟ قال: من قول الله عز وجل: (ولقد أرسلنا نوحا وإبراهيم وجعلنا في ذريتهما النبوة والكتاب فمنهم مهتد وكثير منهم فاسقون) (4) فصارت وارثة النبوة والكتاب للمهتدين دون الفاسقين، أما علمتم أن نوحا (عليه السلام) حين سأل ربه: (فقال رب إن ابني من أهلي وإن وعدك الحق وأنت أحكم  الحاكمين) (1) وذلك أن الله عز وجل وعده أن ينجيه وأهله، فقال له ربه: (يا نوح إنه ليس من أهلك إنه عمل غير صالح فلا تسئلن ما ليس لك به علم إني أعظك أن تكون من الجاهلين) (2). فقال المأمون: هل فضل الله العترة على سائر الناس؟ فقال أبو الحسن (عليه السلام): إن الله عز وجل أبان فضل العترة على سائر الناس في محكم كتابه. فقال له المأمون: أين ذلك من كتاب الله؟ فقال له الرضا (عليه السلام): في قوله عز وجل: (إن الله اصطفى آدم ونوحا وآل إبراهيم وآل عمران على العالمين * ذرية بعضها من بعض) (3)، وقال عز وجل: في موضع آخر: (أم يحسدون الناس على ما أتاهم الله من فضله فقد آتينا آل إبراهيم الكتاب والحكمة وءاتيناهم ملكا عظيما) (4)، ثم رد المخاطبة في إثر هذا إلى سائر المؤمنين فقال: (يا أيها الذين آمنوا أطيعوا الله وأطيعوا الرسول وأولي الامر منكم) (5) يعني الذي قرنهم بالكتاب والحكمة وحسدوا عليهما، فقوله: (أم يحسدون الناس على ما أتاهم الله من فضله فقد آتينا آل إبراهيم الكتاب والحكمة وءاتيناهم ملكا عظيما) يعني الطاعة للمصطفين الطاهرين، فالملك ها هنا هو الطاعة لهم. قالت العلماء: فأخبرنا هل فسر الله عز وجل الاصطفاء في الكتاب؟ فقال الرضا (عليه السلام): فسر الاصطفاء في الظاهر سوى الباطن في اثني عشر موضعا وموطنا، فأول ذلك قوله عز وجل: (وأنذر عشيرتك الاقربين ورهطك المخلصين) (6) هكذا في قراءة أبي بن كعب، وهي ثابتة في مصحف عبد الله بن مسعود، وهذه منزلة رفيعة  وفضل عظيم وشرف عال حين عنى الله عز وجل بذلك الآل، فذكره لرسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله)، فهذه واحدة. والآية الثانية في الاصطفاء، قوله عز وجل: (إنما يريد الله ليذهب عنكم الرجس أهل البيت ويطهركم تطهيرا) وهذا الفضل الذي لا يجهله أحد معاند أصلا، لانه فضل بعد طهارة تنتظر، فهذه الثانية. وأما الثالثة: فحين ميز الله الطاهرين من خلقه، فأمر نبيه (صلى الله عليه وآله) بالمباهلة في آية الابتهال، فقال عز وجل: قل يا محمد (تعالوا ندع أبناءنا وأبناءكم ونساءنا ونساءكم وأنفسنا وأنفسكم ثم نبتهل فنجعل لعنت الله على الكاذبين) (1) فأبرز النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله) عليا والحسن والحسين وفاطمة (صلوات الله وسلامه عليهم) وقرن أنفسهم بنفسه، فهل تدرون ما معنى قوله عز وجل: (وأنفسنا وأنفسكم)؟ قالت العلماء: عنى به نفسهم. فقال أبو الحسن (عليه السلام): غلطتم، إنما عنى بها علي بن أبي طالب (عليه السلام)، ومما يدل على ذلك، قول النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله) حين قال: لينتهين بنو وليعة أو لابعثن إليهم رجلا كنفسي، يعني علي بن أبي طالب (عليه السلام)، فهذه خصوصية لا يتقدمه فيها أحد، وفضل لا يلحقه فيه بشر، وشرف لا يسبقه إليه خلق أن جعل نفس علي كنفسه، فهذه الثالثة. وأما الرابعة: فإخراجه (صلى الله عليه وآله) الناس من مسجده ما خلا العترة حتى تكلم الناس في ذلك وتكلم العباس، فقال: يا رسول الله، تركت عليا وأخرجتنا! فقال رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله): ما أنا تركته وأخرجتكم، ولكن الله تركه وأخرجكم. وفي هذا تبيان قوله لعلي (عليه السلام): أنت مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى. قالت العلماء: فأين هذا من القرآن؟ قال أبو الحسن (عليه السلام) أو جدكم في ذلك قرآنا أقرؤه عليكم؟ قالوا: هات. قال قول الله عز وجل: (وأوحينا إلى موسى وأخيه  أن تبوءا لقومكما بمصر بيوتا واجعلوا بيوتكم قبلة) (1) ففي هذه الآية منزلة هارون من موسى، وفيها أيضا منزلة علي (عليه السلام) من رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله)، ومع هذا دليل ظاهر في قول رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله)، حين قال: ألا إن هذا المسجد لا يحل لجنب إلا لمحمد وآله. فقالت العلماء: يا أبا الحسن، هذا الشرح وهذا البيان، لا يوجد إلا عندكم معشر أهل بيت رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله). فقال: ومن ينكر لنا ذلك؟ ورسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) يقول: أنا مدينة الحكمة وعلي بابها، فمن أراد المدينة فليأتها من بابها، ففيما أوضحنا وشرحنا من الفضل والشرف والتقدمة والاصطفاء والطهارة ما لا ينكره معاند، ولله عز وجل الحمد على ذلك، فهذه الرابعة. والآية الخامسة قول الله عز وجل: (وآت ذا القربى حقه) (2) خصوصية خصهم الله العزيز الجبار بها، واصطفاهم على الامة، فلما نزلت هذه الآية على رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) قال: ادعوا لي فاطمة. فدعيت له، فقال: يا فاطمة قالت: لبيك يا رسول الله. فقال (صلى الله عليه وآله): هذه فدك، هي مما لم يوجف عليه بخيل ولا ركاب، وهي لي خاصة دون المسلمين، وقد جعلتها لك لما أمرني الله به، فخذيها لك ولولدك، فهذه الخامسة. والآية السادسة: قول الله جل جلاله: (قل لا اسئلكم عليه أجرا إلا المودة في القربى) (3) وهذه خصوصية للنبي (صلى الله عليه وآله) إلى يوم القيامة، وخصوصية للآل دون غيرهم، وذلك أن الله حكى في ذكر نوح (عليه السلام) في كتابه: (يا قوم لا أسئلكم عليه مالا إن أجري إلا على الله وما أنا بطارد الذين ءامنوا إنهم ملاقوا ربهم ولكني أراكم قوما تجهلون) (4) وحكى عز وجل عن هود (عليه السلام) أنه قال: (لا أسئلكم  عليه أجرا إن أجري إلا على الذي فطرني أفلا تعقلون) (1)، وقال عز وجل لنبيه (صلى الله عليه وآله): (قل) يا محمد (لا أسئلكم عليه أجرا إلا المودة في القربى) ولم يفرض الله مودتهم إلا وقد علم أنهم لا يرتدون عن الدين أبدا، ولا يرجعون إلى ضلال أبدا. وأخرى أن يكون الرجل وادا للرجل، فيكون بعض أهل بيته عدوا له، فلا يسلم قلب الرجل له، فأحب الله عز وجل أن لا يكون في قلب رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) على المؤمنين شئ، ففرض عليهم مودة ذوي القربى، فمن أخذ بها وأحب رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) وأحب أهل بيته، لم يستطع رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) أن يبغضه، ومن تركها ولم يأخذ بها وأبغض أهل بيته، فعلى رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) أن يبغضه لانه قد ترك فريضة من فرائض الله، فأي فضيلة وأي شرف يتقدم هذا أو يدانيه؟ فأنزل الله هذه الآية على نبيه (صلى الله عليه وآله): (قل لا أسئلكم عليه أجرا إلا المودة في القربى) فقام رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) في أصحابه، فحمد الله وأثنى عليه، وقال: أيها الناس، إن الله قد فرض لي عليكم فرضا، فهل أنتم مؤدوه؟ فلم يجبه أحد. فقال: أيها الناس، إنه ليس بذهب ولا فضة، ولا مأكول ولا مشروب. فقالوا: هات إذن. فتلا عليهم هذه الآية، فقالوا أما هذا فنعم، فما وفى بها أكثرهم. وما بعث الله عز وجل نبيا إلا أوحى إليه أن لا يسأل قومه أجرا، لان الله عز وجل يوفي أجر الانبياء، ومحمد (2) (صلى الله عليه وآله) فرض الله عز وجل مودة قرابته على امته، وأمره أن يجعل أجره فيهم ليودوه في قرابته بمعرفة فضلهم الذي أوجب الله عز وجل لهم، فإن المودة إنما تكون على قدر معرفة الفضل. فلما أوجب الله ذلك ثقل لثقل (3) وجوب الطاعة، فتمسك بها قوم أخذ الله  ميثاقهم على الوفاء، وعاند أهل الشقاق والنفاق، وألحدوا في ذلك، فصرفوه عن حده الذي حده الله، فقالوا: القرابة هم العرب كلها وأهل دعوته، فعلى أي الحالتين كان، فقد علمنا أن المودة هي للقرابة، فأقربهم من النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله) أولاهم بالمودة، كلما قربت القرابة كانت المودة على قدرها. وما أنصفوا نبي الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) في حيطته ورأفته، وما من الله به على امته، مما تعجز الالسن عن وصف الشكر عليه، أن لا يودوه في ذريته وأهل بيته، وأن لا يجعلوهم منهم كمنزلة العين من الرأس حفظا لرسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) وحبا لنبيه (1)، فكيف والقرآن ينطق به ويدعو إليه؟ والاخبار ثابتة بأنهم أهل المودة، والذين فرض الله مودتهم، ووعد الجزاء عليها، أنه ما وفى أحد بهذه المودة مؤمنا مخلصا إلا استوجب الجنة، لقول الله عز وجل في هذه الآية: (والذين ءامنوا وعملوا الصالحات في روضات الجنات لهم ما يشاءون عند ربهم ذلك هو الفضل الكبير * ذلك الذى يبشر الله عباده الذين ءامنوا وعملوا الصالحات قل لا أسئلكم عليه أجرا إلا المودة في القربى) (2) مفسرا ومبينا. ثم قال أبو الحسن (عليه السلام): حدثني أبي، عن جدي، عن آبائه، عن الحسين بن علي (عليهم السلام)، قال: اجتمع المهاجرون والانصار إلى رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) فقالوا: إن لك - يا رسول الله - مؤونة في نفقتك وفيمن يأتيك من الوفود، وهذه أموالنا مع دمائنا فاحكم فيها بارا، مأجورا، أعط ما شئت، وأمسك ما شئت، من غير حرج، قال: فأنزل الله عز وجل عليه الروح الامين فقال: يا محمد، (قل لا أسئلكم عليه أجرا إلا المودة في القربى) يعني أن تودوا قرابتي من بعدي، فخرجوا، فقال المنافقون: ما حمل رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) على ترك ما عرضنا عليه إلا ليحثنا على قرابته من بعده، إن هو إلا شئ افتراه في مجلسه، وكان ذلك من قولهم عظيما، فأنزل الله عز وجل  جبرئيل بهذه الآية (أم يقولون افتراه قل إن افتريته فلا تملكون لي من الله شيئا هو أعلم بما تفيضون فيه كفى به شهيدا بيني وبينكم وهو الغفور الرحيم) (1) فبعث إليهم النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله) فقال: هل من حدث؟ فقالوا: إي والله يا رسول الله، لقد قال بعضنا كلاما غليظا كرهناه، فتلا عليهم رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) الآية فبكوا واشتد بكاؤهم، فأنزل الله عز وجل (وهو الذي يقبل التوبة عن عباده ويعفو عن السيئات ويعلم ما تفعلون) (2)، فهذه السادسة. وأما الآية السابعة: فقول الله تبارك وتعالى: (إن الله وملائكته يصلون على النبي يا أيها الذين ءامنوا صلوا عليه وسلموا تسليما) (3) وقد علم المعاندون منهم أنه لما نزلت هذه الآية قيل: يا رسول الله، قد عرفنا التسليم عليك، فكيف الصلاة عليك؟ فقال: تقولون اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد كما صليت على إبراهيم و (4) آل إبراهيم إنك حميد مجيد، فهل بينكم - معاشر الناس - في هذا خلاف؟ قالوا لا. قال المأمون: هذا ما (5) لا خلاف فيه أصلا، وعليه الاجماع، فهل عندك في الآل شئ أوضح من هذا في القرآن؟ قال أبو الحسن (عليه السلام): نعم، أخبروني عن قول الله عز وجل: (يس والقرآن الحكيم * إنك لمن المرسلين * على صراط المستقيم) (6)، فمن عنى بقوله: (يس)؟ قالت العلماء: (يس) محمد (صلى الله عليه وآله)، لم يشك فيه أحد. قال أبو الحسن (عليه السلام): فإن الله أعطى محمدا (صلى الله عليه وآله) وآل محمد من  ذلك فضلا لا يبلغ أحد كنه وصفه إلا من عقله، وذلك أن الله لم يسلم على أحد إلا على الانبياء (صلوات الله عليهم)، فقال تبارك وتعالى: (سلام على نوح في العلمين) (1)، وقال: (سلام على إبراهيم) (2) وقال: (سلام على موسى وهارون) (3)، ولم يقل: سلام على آل نوح، ولم يقل: سلام على آل موسى ولا على آل إبراهيم، وقال: * (سلام على آل ياسين) (4)، يعني آل محمد (صلى الله عليه وآله) - فقال المأمون: قد علمت أن في معدن النبوة شرح هذا وبيانه - فهذه السابعة. وأما الثامنة: فقول الله عز وجل: (واعلموا أنما غنمتم من شئ فأن لله خمسه وللرسول ولذي القربى) فقرن سهم ذي القربى مع سهمه وسهم رسوله، فهذا فصل أيضا بين الآل والامة، لان الله جعلهم في حيز، وجعل الناس في حيز دون ذلك، ورضي لهم ما رضي لنفسه، واصطفاهم فيه، فبدأ بنفسه، ثم برسوله، ثم بذي القربى بكل ما كان من الفئ والغنيمة وغير ذلك مما رضيه عز وجل لنفسه ورضيه لهم، فقال وقوله الحق: (واعلموا أنما غنمتم من شئ فأن لله خمسه وللرسول ولذي القربى) فهذا تأكيد مؤكد وأثر قائم لهم إلى يوم القيامة في كتاب الله الناطق الذي لا يأتيه الباطل من بين يديه ولا من خلفه تنزيل من حكيم حميد. وأما قوله: (واليتامى والمساكين) (5) فإن اليتيم إذا انقطع يتمه خرج من الغنائم، ولم يكن له فيها نصيب، وكذلك المسكين إذا انقطعت مسكنته لم يكن له نصيب من المغنم، ولا يحل له أخذه، وسهم ذي القربى إلى يوم القيامة قائم لهم، للغني والفقير منهم، لانه لا أحد أغنى من الله عز وجل ولا من رسوله (صلى الله عليه وآله)، فجعل لنفسه معهما سهما ولرسوله سهما، فما رضيه لنفسه ولرسوله رضيه لهم.  وكذلك الفئ ما رضيه منه لنفسه ولنبيه رضيه لذي القربى، كما أجراهم في الغنيمة، فبدأ بنفسه جل جلاله، ثم برسوله، ثم بهم، وقرن سهمهم بسهم الله وسهم رسوله. وكذلك في الطاعة، قال: (يا أيها الذين ءامنوا أطيعوا الله وأطيعوا الرسول وأولي الامر منكم) (1)، فبدأ بنفسه، ثم برسوله، ثم بأهل بيته. وكذلك آية الولاية: (إنما وليكم الله ورسوله والذين ءامنوا) (2) فجعل ولايتهم مع طاعة الرسول مقرونة بطاعته، كما جعل سهمهم مع سهم الرسول مقرونا بسهمه في الغنيمة والفئ، فتبارك الله وتعالى ما أعظم نعمته على أهل هذا البيت! فلما جاءت قصة الصدقة نزه نفسه، ونزه رسوله، ونزه أهل بيته، فقال: (إنما الصدقات للفقراء والمساكين والعاملين عليها والمؤلفة قلوبهم وفي الرقاب والغارمين وفي سبيل الله وابن السبيل فريضة من الله) (3) فهل تجد في شئ من ذلك أنه جعل عز وجل سهما لنفسه أو لرسوله أو لذي القربى؟ لانه لما نزه نفسه عن الصدقة ونزه رسوله نزه أهل بيته، لا بل حرم عليهم، لان الصدقة محرمة على محمد وآله، وهي أوساخ أيدي الناس لا تحل لهم، لانهم طهروا من كل دنس ووسخ، فلما طهرهم الله وأصطفاهم رضي لهم ما رضي لنفسه، وكره لهم ما كره لنفسه عز وجل، فهذه الثامنة. وأما التاسعة: فنحن أهل الذكر الذين قال الله في محكم كتابه: (فسئلوا أهل الذكر إن كنتم لا تعلمون) (4) فقالت العلماء: إنما عنى بذلك اليهود والنصارى. فقال أبو الحسن (عليه السلام) سبحان الله! وهل يجوز ذلك؟ إذن يدعونا إلى دينهم. ويقولون: إنه أفضل من دين الاسلام.  فقال المأمون: فهل عندك في ذلك شرح بخلاف ما قالوا، يا أبا الحسن؟ فقال (عليه السلام): نعم، الذكر: رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله)، ونحن أهله، وذلك بين في كتاب الله عز وجل حيث يقول في سورة الطلاق: (فاتقوا الله يا أولى الالباب الذين ءامنوا قد أنزل الله إليكم ذكرا رسولا يتلوا عليكم آيات الله مبينات) (1) فالذكر رسول الله، ونحن أهله، فهذه التاسعة. وأما العاشرة: فقول الله عز وجل في آية التحريم: (حرمت عليكم أمهاتكم وبناتكم وأخواتكم) (2) الآية إلى آخرها، فأخبروني هل تصلح ابنتي أو ابنة ابني وما تناسل من صلبي لرسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) أن يتزوجها لو كان حيا؟ قالوا: لا. قال: فأخبروني هل كانت ابنة أحدكم تصلح له أن يتزوجها لو كان حيا؟ قالوا: لا. قال: ففي هذا بيان، لاني أنا من آله ولستم من آله، ولو كنتم من آله لحرم عليه بناتكم كما حرم عليه بناتي، لاني (3) من آله وأنتم من امته، فهذا فرق ما بين الآل والامة، لان الآل منه، والامة إذا لم تكن من الآل ليست منه، فهذه العاشرة. وأما الحادية عشرة: فقول الله عز وجل في سورة المؤمن حكاية عن قول رجل مؤمن من آل فرعون: (وقال رجل مؤمن من ءال فرعون يكتم إيمانه أتقتلون رجلا أن يقول ربي الله وقد جاءكم بالبينات من ربكم) (4)، تمام الآية، فكان ابن خال فرعون، فنسبه إلى فرعون بنسبه، ولم يضفه إليه بدينه، وكذلك خصصنا نحن إذ كنا من آل رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) بولادتنا منه، وعممنا الناس بالدين، فهذا فرق ما بين الآل والامة، فهذه الحادية عشرة. وأما الثانية عشرة: فقول الله عز وجل: (وأمر أهلك بالصلاة واصطبر  عليها) (1) فخصنا الله بهذه الخصوصية، أن أمرنا مع الامة بإقامة الصلاة، ثم خصنا من دون الامة، فكان رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) يجيئ إلى باب علي وفاطمة بعد نزول هذه الآية تسعة أشهر كل يوم عند حضور كل صلاة خمس مرات، فيقول: الصلاة رحمكم الله. وما أكرم الله أحدا من ذراري الانبياء بمثل هذه الكرامة التي أكرمنا بها، وخصنا من دون جميع أهل بيته. فقال المأمون والعلماء: جزاكم الله أهل بيت نبيكم عن الامة خيرا، فما نجد الشرح والبيان فيما اشتبه علينا إلا عندكم (2).",

    "thaqalaynSanad": "Abu Ja`far Muhammad b. `Ali b. al-Husayn b. Musa b. Babuwayh al-Qummi (rh) narrated to us. He said: `Ali b. al-Husayn b. Shadhuwayh al-Mu’addab and Ja`far b. Muhammad b. Masrur (ra) narrated to us. They said: Muhammad b. `Abdullah b. Ja`far al-Himyari narrated to us from his father from al-Rayyan b. al-Salt. He said: ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "Al-Rida (as) attended a gathering with al-Ma’mun in Marv, who had gathered a group of scholars from the people of Iraq and Khurasan. So, al-Ma’mun said: Inform me of the meaning of this verse, “Then, We bequeathed the Book to Our chosen servants.” (35:32) So, the scholars said: By this, Allah meant this entire Nation (Umma). So, al-Ma’mun said: What do you say, Aba’l Hasan? So, al-Rida (as) said: I do not say as they have said, but rather I say: Allah meant the pure progeny (al-`itra al-tahira). So, al-Ma’mun said: How could have He meant the progeny without the Nation? So, al-Rida (as) said to him: Had He meant the Nation, then it would be going to Paradise in its entirety, as per the saying of Allah, “Some of them wrong themselves, some follow a middle course, and some are foremost in good deeds by the permission of Allah. That is the greatest bounty.” (35:32) Then, He included all of them in Paradise, saying, “They will enter the Gardens of Eternity, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold” (35:33). Therefore, the bequeathal is to the pure progeny, not to others. Then, al-Ma’mun said: Who are the pure progeny? So, al-Rida (as) said: Those whom Allah described in His Book. \u003Cbr\u003E He says, “Surely, Allah only wishes to remove uncleanliness from you, O Ahl al-Bayt, and purify you with a thorough purification.” (33:33) They are the ones about whom the Messenger of Allah (s) said: “Surely, I leave behind the two heavyweights among you: (1) the Book of Allah, and (2) my progeny, my Ahl al-Bayt. Surely, they will not separate until they return to me at the Pond. So, watch how you handle them after me. O people! Do not teach them, for they know more than you.” The scholars said: Inform us, Aba’l Hasan, about the progeny – are they the Family (al-Aal) or are they different than the Family? So, al-Rida (as) said: They are the Family. So, the scholars said: It is reported that the Messenger of Allah (s) said: “My Nation is my Family.” His companions have thoroughly reported that the Family of Muhammad is his Nation, to a point where it cannot be denied. So, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Inform me: is charity not forbidden for the Family? They said: Yes. He said: So, is it forbidden for the Nation? They said: No. He said: This is a difference that distinguishes the Family from the Nation. Woe to you for where you have been taken to! Have you deviated from the remembrance of the page (the Quran)? Are you an extravagant people?! Do you not know that [these verses on] bequeathal and purity apply to the chosen, guided ones and not the rest of you? They said: From where [did you read this], Aba’l Hasan? He said: From the saying of Allah, “We have sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and We have placed prophethood and the Book in their descendants. Among them are those who are guided, but many of them are transgressors.” (57:26) The inheritors of prophethood and the Book went to those who are guided, not the transgressors. Do you not know that, when Nuh (as) asked his Lord, “So, he said: My Lord! Surely, my son is from my family, and surely, Your promise is true, and You are the most just of the judges.” (11:45) That was when Allah promised to save him and his family. So, his Lord said to him, “O Nuh! He is not of your family. Surely, he is one whose work was other than righteous; so do not ask about that which you have no knowledge of. I exhort you from being of the ignorant.” (11:46) Then, al-Ma’mun said: Has Allah favoured the progeny over the rest of the people? So, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Surely, Allah demonstrated the favour of the progeny over the rest of the people in the decisive [verses] of His Book. \u003Cbr\u003E So, al-Ma’mun said to him: Where is that in the Book of Allah? So, a-Rida (as) said: In His saying, “Surely, Allah has chosen Adam, Nuh, the Family of Ibrahim, and the Family of `Imran over the people. Offspring, one of the other.” (3:33-34) He said in another place, “Do they envy what Allah has given them of His favour? We have given the Family of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them great authority.” (4:54) Then, He proceeded to address the rest of the believers in context to this, “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and the Masters of Authority among” (4:59) – meaning, those whom We bestowed with the Book and the wisdom, and they were envied upon that. So, His saying, “Do they envy what Allah has given them of His favour? We have given the Family of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them great authority” (4:54) refers to obedience to the chosen and pure ones. Authority here refers to obedience to them. The scholars said: Inform us: Has Allah explained chosenness in His Book? \u003Cbr\u003E So, al-Rida (as) said: He explained this chosenness in twelve apparent places, not including [any] esoteric [places]. The first of those is His saying, “Warn your closest relatives *and your chosen group*” (26:214) – this is in the recitation of Ubay b. Ka`b, and it is firm in the codex of `Abdullah b. Mas`ud. This is an elevated rank, a great favour, and an exalted honour that Allah used when referring to this Family. He mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (s) – and this is the first [verse]. The second verse in relation to chosenness is His saying, “Surely, Allah only wishes to remove uncleanliness from you, O Ahl al-Bayt, and purify you with a thorough purification.” (33:33) This is a favour that no stubborn person is ignorant of, because favour comes after purity.  As for the third, it is when Allah distinguished the pure ones from His creation and ordered His Prophet to the imprecation (mubahala) in the Verse of Imprecation. He said: Say, O Muhammad, “Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, our selves and your selves. Then, we will imprecate, and we will put the curse of Allah over the liars.” (3:61) \u003Cbr\u003E So, the Prophet (s) honoured `Ali, al-Hasan, al-Husayn, and Fatima (s) and compared their selves to his self. Do you comprehend the meaning of His saying, “our selves and your selves”? The scholars said: It means themselves. \u003Cbr\u003E So, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: You are incorrect. Surely, it only refers to `Ali b. Abi Talib (as). The saying of the Prophet (s) indicates this when he said: “Banu Wali`a will stop or I will send them a man like myself” – meaning, `Ali b. Abi Talib (as). This specifically [is a virtue] that none surpass him in, and a favour that no human will follow him in, and an honour that no creature preceded him in; that he positioned `Ali to his own self – this is the third.  As for the fourth: he (s) ordered the people to leave his Mosque with exception to the progeny. The people talked about that, and [even] al-`Abbas [b. `Abd al-Muttalib] talked about it. He said: “O Messenger of Allah! You have left `Ali and you have ordered us to leave!” \u003Cbr\u003E So, the Messenger of Allah (s) said: “It was not I who left him and ordered you to leave, but rather it was Allah that left him and ordered you to leave.” In this is an elucidation of his saying to `Ali (as): “You are to me as Harun was to Musa.” The scholars said: Where is this in the Quran? Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Shall I bring it to you from the Quran and recite it to you? They said: Bring it. He said: The saying of Allah, “We revealed to Musa and his brother: settle your people in houses in Egypt and make your houses the qibla.” (10:87) In this verse is the status of Harun to Musa, and likewise therein is the status of `Ali (as) to the Messenger of Allah (s). From this is a clear indication regarding the saying of the Messenger of Allah (s) when he said: “Surely, none can be in a state of janaba in this Mosque except Muhammad and his Family.” \u003Cbr\u003E So, the scholars said: O Aba’l Hasan! This interpretation and elucidation is not found except with you, the Ahl al-Bayt of the Messenger of Allah (s). So, he said: Who denies that of us? The Messenger of Allah (s) said: “I am the City of Wisdom and `Ali is its Gate, so whoever wants the City must come to it by its Gate.” We have clarified and explained this favour, honour, pre-eminence, chosenness, and purity in a way that cannot be denied by a stubborn person; and praise be to Allah for that – this is the fourth. The fifth verse is the saying of Allah, “Give those near in kin their right” (17:26) – Allah the Glorious and Powerful specified them in it, and He chose them over the Nation. When this verse was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (s), he said: “Call to Fatima for me.” \u003Cbr\u003E So, she was called for him, then he said: “O Fatima!” She said: “I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah.” So, he (s) said: “Fadak is that which no horse nor camel rushed upon [to seize]. It belongs to me alone and not the Muslims. I have given it to you when Allah commanded me to. So, take it for yourself and your children” – this is the fifth. The sixth verse is the saying of Allah, “Say: I do not ask you for a reward for it except to love those near in kin.” (42:23) This is specifically for the Prophet (s) until the Day of Resurrection, and specifically to the Family and not anyone else. This is because Allah reported what Nuh (as) had said in His Book, “And O my people, I ask not of you for it any wealth. My reward is not but from Allah. And I am not one to drive away those who have believed. Surely, they will meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly.” (11:29) He reported what Hud (as) had said, “I do not ask you for any reward. My reward is only from the one who created me. Do you, then, not understand?” (11:51) He said to His Prophet (s), “Say” – O Muhammad – “I do not ask you for a reward for it except to love those near in kin.” (42:23) Allah would not obligate their love without knowing that they will not ever apostate from the religion, nor will they ever go back to misguidance. A man may love a man, but if he is an enemy to a family member of his, the man’s heart will not be at peace with him. \u003Cbr\u003E So, Allah did not want anything of malice in the heart of the Messenger of Allah (s) for the believers, thus he obligated loving those near in kin. Whoever fulfills this, loves the Messenger of Allah (s), and loves his Ahl al-Bayt, the Messenger of Allah (s) will not be able to hate him; but whoever abandons this, and does not fulfill it, and hates his Ahl al-Bayt, then it is incumbent on the Messenger of Allah (s) to hate him, for he will have abandoned an obligation set by Allah. \u003Cbr\u003E So, what favour and what honour supersedes or [even] comes close to this? When Allah revealed this verse upon His Prophet (s), “Say: I do not ask you for a reward for it except to love those near in kin.” (42:23), the Messenger of Allah (s) stood among his companions, praised Allah and commended Him, and said: “O people! Allah has obligated something for me upon you. Will you fulfill it?” None answered him. Then, he said: “O people! It is not [something fulfilled] by gold, silver, food, or drink. \u003Cbr\u003E So, they said: “Give it.” So, he recited this verse, and they said: “As for this, then yes.” However, most of them did not fulfill it. Allah did not send a prophet except that he revealed to him that he is to not ask for a reward from his people, because Allah fulfills the reward of the prophets. For Muhammad (s), Allah obligated the love for his kin for his Nation, and He commanded him to make his reward with them their love for him through his relatives. [This can only be] by recognizing their favour, which Allah obligated for them, for love can only be at the level of recognition of their favour. When Allah obligated this, it was as heavy as the obligation of obeying them. Some who took a covenant with Allah held onto this to fulfill the promise, but the people of discord and hypocrisy were stubborn and disbelieved in it. They took it beyond the limit that Allah limited it with, and they said: “The kin are all the Arabs and the people he called to.” Upon this, the two opinions came about. We know that the love is for the related, and the most related of them to the Prophet (s) is the most rightful of them to the love. The closer the relation is, the more love is in proportion to it. They were unjust to the Prophet of Allah (s) in honouring him and being affectionate to him and that which Allah [obligated] his Nation with regards to him and thanking him in a way that tongues cannot describe. They did not love him through his descendants and his Ahl al-Bayt, and they did not confer a status to them like that of the eye to the head, as a trust to the Messenger of Allah (s) and out of love for His Prophet. How is this when the Quran speaks about it and calls to it? The reports are sound that they are the people of this love, and they are the ones whose love Allah obligated. He promised the reward upon this – there is not one sincere, believing person in this love except that Paradise becomes obligatory for him, as per the saying of Allah in this verse, “And those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens [in Paradise] having whatever they will in the presence of their Lord. That is what is the great bounty. That is the good news that Allah gives to His servants who believed and did righteous deeds. Say, “I do not ask you any fee for it, except the love of kinship” (42:22-23) – interpreted and clarified. Then, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: My father narrated to me from my grandfather from his forefathers from al-Husayn b. `Ali (as). He said: The Muhajirin and the Ansar gathered to the Messenger of Allah (s) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, you have difficulties and expenses with regards to those who visit you. Here is our wealth and our blood, so manage it how you will in righteousness and reward – give what you wish and withhold what you wish, regardless of any need.” He said: So, Allah sent the Trustworthy Spirit down to him, who said: “O Muhammad! ‘Say: I do not ask you for a reward for it except to love those near in kin.’ (42:23)” – meaning, love my kin after me. \u003Cbr\u003E So, they left. The hypocrites said: “The Messenger of Allah (s) did not abandon what we have presented to him except to urge us [to accept] his kin after him. It is but something that he concocted in his sitting place.” That was a great calumny of theirs, so Allah revealed this verse to Gabriel, “Or do they say that he concocted it? Say: ‘If I have done so, then there is nothing whatsoever you can do to save me from Allah. He knows best what you indulge about it. Sufficient is He as a Witness between you and me. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’” (46:8) \u003Cbr\u003E So, the Prophet (s) sent for them and said: “Did anyone say anything?” They said: “Yes, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah. Some of us said repugnant words that we hated.” So, the Messenger of Allah (s) recited the verse to them, and they wept, and their weeping intensified. Then, Allah revealed, “It is He who accepts repentance from His servants and forgives sins and knows what they do.” (42:25) So, this is the sixth. As for the seventh verse, it is the saying of Allah, “Surely, Allah and His angels bless the Prophet. O you who believe! Bless him and bid peace.” (33:56) Those who were stubborn of them became known when this verse was revealed; it was said: “O Messenger of Allah! We know how to bid you peace (taslim), but how do we bless you?” \u003Cbr\u003E So, he said: “You say: ‘O Allah, bless Muhammad and the Family of Muhammad just as You blessed Ibrahim and the Family of Ibrahim. Surely, You are the Praiseworthy, the Great.’” O people! So, is there any among you who disagrees with this? They said: No. Al-Ma’mun said: There is no disagreement in this anyway, as there is a consensus on it. Do you have anything clearer than this in the Quran about the Family [in particular]? Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Yes. Inform me of the saying of Allah, “Yasin. By the Wise Quran, surely, you are of the messengers, upon a Straight Path.” (36:1-4) What did He mean when He said, “Yasin”? The scholars said: Yasin is Muhammad (s). No one doubts this. Abu’l Hasan (as) said: Surely, Allah has granted Muhammad (s) and the Family of Muhammad a favour that none can comprehend or describe except one who intelligizes it: Allah does not give salaam to anyone [in the Quran] except the prophets (as). He says, “Peace be with Nuh among the worlds” (37:79), and He says, “Peace be with Ibrahim” (37:109), and He says, “Peace be with Musa and Harun” (37:120), but He did not say: “Peace be with the Family of Nuh”, nor did He say: “Peace be with the Family of Musa” nor “with the Family of Ibrahim” – yet He says, “Peace be with the Family of Yasin” (37:130), meaning the Family of Muhammad (s). Then, al-Ma’mun said: I knew that in the goldmine of prophethood there was an explanation and clarification of this – so this is the seventh. As for the eighth, Allah says, “Know that when you gain a thing, then a fifth of it is for Allah, the Messenger, and those near of kin.” (8:41), so He compared the portion of those near of kin to His portion and His Messenger’s portion. This is another difference between the Family and the Nation because Allah placed them in a position and placed the people in another position. He willed for them what He willed for Himself, and He chose them therein. He began with Himself, then His Messenger, then those near of kin in regard to the fay’, the spoils, and other than that, decreeing for them what He decreed for Himself and for them. He says, and His saying is true, “Know that when you gain a thing, then a fifth of it is for Allah, the Messenger, and those near of kin.” (8:41) This is a steadfast guarantee and a standing decree for them until the Day of Resurrection, [written] in the Speaking Book of Allah; which falsehood cannot come to before it or behind it, revealed by the Wise, the Praiseworthy. As for His saying, “and the orphans and the poor” (8:41), when the orphan matures, he does not receive the khums and he does not have a right to it. It is the same with the poor: if his poverty goes, then he will not have a right to the khums, and it will not be permissible to take. The portion of those near in kin is established for them until the Day of Resurrection, whether they are wealthy or poor. There is none wealthier than Allah nor His Messenger (s), so He set a portion for Himself and His Messenger. Whatever He willed for Himself and His Messenger, He willed for them. It is the same with the fay’: what He willed for Himself and His Prophet, He willed for those near in kin. He began with Himself, then His Messenger, then them; and He compared their portion with Allah’s portion and His Messenger’s portion. It is like that in obedience – He says, “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and the Masters of Authority among” (4:59) – He began with Himself, then His Messenger, then his Ah al-Bayt. It is like that in the Verse of Wilaya, “Surely, your wali is only Allah, His Messenger, and those who believe …” (5:55) \u003Cbr\u003E So, He made their wilaya, alongside the obedience owed to the Messenger, like the obedience owed to Him; just as He made their portion alongside the portion of the Messenger like His portion in the spoils and the fay’. May Allah be glorified and exalted for making His blessing over this Ahl al-Bayt great! When the delineation for charity came, He exempted Himself, His Messenger, and his Ahl al-Bayt. He says, “Surely, charity is only for the poor, the needy, those employed to collect it, those whose hearts are attracted [to Islam], for freeing slaves, for those in debt, for Allah’s cause, and for wayfarers. This is obligated by Allah.” (9:60) Do you see anything in this that is apportioned for Himself, His Messenger, or those near of kin? Because when He exempted Himself, His Messenger, and His Ahl al-Bayt from charity, He forbade it for them, for charity is forbidden for Muhammad and His Family. It is the impure [wealth] that is in the hands of the people, and it is forbidden for them, because they are purified from every uncleanliness and dirtiness. When Allah purified and chose them, He willed for them what He willed for Himself, and He disliked for them what He disliked for Himself. So, this is the eighth. As for the ninth: we are the People of the Reminder (Ahl al-Dhikr) about whom Allah says in the decisive [verse] of His Book, “So, ask the People of the Reminder if you do not know.” (16:43) The scholars said: With this, He means the Jews and the Christians. So, Abu’l Hasan (as) said: May Allah be glorified! Is that permissible? They would call us to their religion, and say that it is better than the religion of Islam. Al-Ma’mun said: Do you have an interpretation that opposes what they have said, Aba’l Hasan? So, he (as) said: Yes. The Reminder is the Messenger of Allah (s), and we are his family (ahl). That is clarified in the Book of Allah where He says in Surat al-Talaq, “Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them. \u003Cbr\u003E So, fear Allah, O people of intellect and belief. Allah has bestowed a Reminder unto you; a messenger reciting Allah’s revelation to you, making things clear” (65:10-11) The Reminder is the Messenger of Allah, and we are his family, so this is the ninth. As for the tenth: it is the saying of Allah in the Verse of Prohibition, “Forbidden to you for marriage are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters …” (4:23) – to the end of the verse. \u003Cbr\u003E So, inform me: had the Messenger of Allah (s) been alive, would he be able to marry my daughter or the daughter of my son from the progeny of the Messenger of Allah (s)? They said: No. He said: So, inform me: had the Messenger of Allah (s) been alive, would he be able to marry your daughter or the daughter of your son? They said: Yes. He said: In this is a sign, for I am from his Family, and you are not from his Family. Had you been from the Family, then he would have been prohibited from your daughters just as he is prohibited from my daughters, because I am from his Family and you are from his Nation. \u003Cbr\u003E So, this is a difference between the Family and the Nation, because the Family is from him, and the Nation – those who are not from the Family – are not from him. \u003Cbr\u003E So, this is the tenth. As for the eleventh: it is the saying of Allah in Surat al-Mu’min, which speaks about a believing man from the Family of Pharaoh, “A believing man from Pharaoh’s Family, who was hiding his faith, argued, ‘Will you kill a man for saying: My Lord is Allah, while he has in fact come to you with clear proofs from your Lord? …’” (40:28) – to the end of the verse. He was maternal cousin of Pharaoh. He is related to Pharaoh in lineage but not in religion [and was called his Family member]. This is how we were specified as being part of the Family of the Messenger of Allah (s) through our birth from him. We are of the same religion as the people, but this is a distinction between the Family and the Nation. \u003Cbr\u003E  So, this is the eleventh. As for the twelfth: it is the saying of Allah, “And enjoin prayer upon your family and be steadfast therein.” (20:132) Allah specified us in particular. He ordered us to establish prayer along with the Nation, then He specified us without the Nation. The Messenger of Allah (s) would come to the door of `Ali and Fatima for nine months after this verse was revealed, at the call to the five daily prayers. He would say: “The prayer – may Allah have mercy on you.” Allah did not honour anyone of the descendants of the prophets in the way that He honoured us; and he specified us among all the people of his household. \u003Cbr\u003E So, al-Ma’mun and the scholars said: On behalf of this Nation, may Allah reward you, the Ahl al-Bayt of your Prophet, with goodness. We did not find an explanation or an elucidation to quell our doubts except with you.",

    "chapter": "The meaning of the Infallibility of the Imam",
    "author": "Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq",
    "translator": "Basel Kadem",
    "englishText": "Abu Ja’far, the compiler of this book, said: The evidence to the Imam’s Infallibility is that since every speech that is transmitted of a sayer is possible to have indications of interpretations, and since most of the Qur’an and the Tradition is what sects have gathered upon as being authentic, not having changed, nor replaced, nor having been increased with nor having been deducted from, are possible to have many indications of interpretation, it is necessary for there to be, with that, an informer who is truthful, protected from purposeful lying and mistake, predicting of what Allah and His Messenger meant in the Book and Tradition in its true and real sense. This is because the creation are disputed with regards to interpretation; every sect tendences along with the Qur’an and the Tradition towards its own opinions. If Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, had left them in this case without an informer of His Book who is truthful about it, then He would have justified for them to be disputed in matters of religion, yet He would have called them to it, as He had sent down a Book that is possible to have several interpretations, and as His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, established a Tradition that is possible to have several interpretations, and yet He has ordered them to act in accordance to it. It is as if He said: Interpret and act. In that lies permissibility of acting with contradictions and of relying on the truth and its opposite. Since that is impossible upon Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, it is necessary for there to be along with the Qur’an and the Tradition, in every age, one who clarifies the meanings which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, meant in the Qur’an with His speech with other than what the terms of the Qur’an carries of possible interpretation, and who clarifies the meanings which the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, meant in his Traditions and reports with other than the possible interpretation of the terms of the reports narrated of him, peace be upon him, on whose authenticity of transmission there is a consensus. If it is necessary that there must be a truthful informer, it is necessary for it to be impossible for him to purposely lie and err in his informing of the intention of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, in His Book and the intention of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, in his reports and Traditions. Since this is necessary, it is necessary for him to be Infallible. What affirms this evidence is that it is not permissible to our opponents for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, to have sent down the Qur’an to the people of the era of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, while there was no Prophet among them and that He would command them to act with it in its true and real sense. Hence, if it is not possible that He had sent down the Qur’an upon a people while there is no speaker on its behalf, no expressor on its behalf, nor interpreter of what is obscure of it nor clarifier of its indications, similarly, it is not possible for us to act with it except if there is, along with it, one who takes among us the position of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, in his people and the people of his era with regards to clarifying its abrogator, abrogated, specific and general elements, and the meanings which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, intended with His Speech, with that which does not possibly contain interpretation, like how the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, was a clarifier of all of that to the people of his age. That is a must, as long as they adhere to intellect and religion. If a sayer was to say: That which delivers to us what we need to know of the unclear elements of the Qur’an and of the meanings intended by Allah, with other than that whose terms may not possibly contain of that, is the nation. That which negates this the most is the nation’s dispute and testimony, in consensus, upon itself in many of the verses of the Qur’an to their ignorance of its meaning which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, intended. In that lies clarification that the nation is not the deliverer on behalf of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, which clarifies the Qur’an, and that in that it does not take the position of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. If a daring was to dares and say: Certainly, it would be possible for Him to have sent down the Qur’an on the people of the era of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, while there is no Prophet with them, and that He would command them to act in worship with what is in it, in spite that interpretation is possible in it. It would be said to him: Suppose that this had caused of dispute in its meanings what has occurred in this age, what would they do? If he would say: What they do at this hour. It would be said: What they have done at this hour is for every sect of the nation to take one side of the interpretation and act with it while declaring as aberrant the sect that opposes them in it and testifying against it that it is not on the truth. If he was to say: It is possible for there to have been so during the first stages of Islam, and in that lies wisdom from Allah and justice towards them. He would (in the case of this statement) have performed a major error and which I have not seen any of the creation daring to, and it would be said to him after that: Then tell us, if it was feasible for the fluent Arabs, the people of the language, to interpret the Qur’an and for each one of them to act with what he interprets of the Arabic language, then what will they do, those of the people who do not know the language? And how will they non-Arabs, of the Turks and the Persians, do? And to what thing will they refer back with regards to knowledge of what Allah has obliged upon them in His Book? And from which sect will they accept, with the dispute among sects with regards to interpretation and your declaration of the permissibility for each sect to act in accordance with its interpretation? Hence, it would be a must for you make the non-Arabs and those who do not understand the language follow the path of the people of the language in the sense that they may follow whichever of the sects they wish. Otherwise, if you would bind upon those who do not understand the language to follow some sects and not others, it implies that you place all the truth with that sect and not others. Hence, if you place the truth in, you would have negated what you based your speech upon, and you would need for there to be with that sect a knowledge and proof by that recognize it (as the truth) from others, and that is not of your saying in which you make all sects equal with regards to the truth in spite of the contradiction between their interpretations. It would then be necessary for you to make for the non-Arabs and those who do not understand the language that they follow whichever of the sects they wish. If you do so, it would imply, at this time, that you do not bind upon any of your opponents, from the Shi’a, Khawarij, people of interpretations and everyone who opposes you from those who have a sect and from innovators who do not have a sect, a condemnation. This is a negation of Islam and violation of the consensus, and it will be said to you: Is it not a condemned opinion that Allah commands the creation to act in worship with the content in a Book that is agreed upon, which none is able to read its content, and that He commands them to research and explore, and that each sect acts with what it sees is in the Book? If you had declared this as permissible, you would have declared frivolity as permissible for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, because that is, indeed, among the characteristics of a frivolous. Also, it implies that you declare as permissible for everyone who ponders upon a thing with his intellect and considers something of religion as good, that he believes in it, because it would be equal; He would have permitted them to act with the foundations of what is allowable and forbidden and its branches by their opinions, or he would permit for them to ponder with their intellects into the roots of religion, all of it, and its branches, from its (tenet of) Monotheism and others, and that they also act with what they consider as good and rely on to be true. If you declare that as permissible, you would have declared it possible for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, to allow for the creation that they testify for Him that He is the second of two, to believe in existentialism and to knowingly reject the Creator, Glorious and Exalted is He. This is the last there is of this speech, because the one who declares as possible that Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, commands us to act in worship by the Book whilst there being the possibility of interpretation and there not being an informer who is truthful to us about its meanings, implies that he declares as permissible for the people of the era of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, the same as that, and if he declares the same as that as permissible, it implies that Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, allows for every sect to act in accordance to what it believes and interprets, because they would not have other than that if they were not to have any proof with regards to this interpretation being more correct than that interpretation. If He has allowed that for them, (it implies that) He has allowed for their follower who does not know the knowledge, and if He allows for those as well, it implies that He allows for us in this age. If He allows that for us with regards to the Book, it implies that He allows that for us with regards to the foundations of what is allowable and forbidden and analogies of the intellect, and that is an exiting of the Religion, all of it. If it is necessary with what we have previously mentioned with regards to that there must be an interpreter on behalf of the Qur’an and the reports of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, it is necessary that he is Infallible, in order for it to be obligatory to accept from him, and if it is necessary that he is Infallible, it is invalidated that this applies to the nation due to what we have clarified of its dispute in the interpretation of the Qur’an and the reports, its quarreling with regards to that and its declaration of each other to be disbelievers. If that is affirmed, it is necessary for the Infallible to be the one that we mentioned, and that is the Imam. We have proved that the Imam is not but Infallible, and we have shown that if Infallibility is necessary to be in the Imam, there is no escape from that the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, to have confirmed his case, because Infallibility is not in the apparent disposition by which it is recognized by the creation through observation. Hence, it is obligatory that it is affirmed by the Knower of unseen things, Blessed and Exalted is He, on the tongue of His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and that is because the Imam is not but affirmed of. The affirmation has been authenticated to us, in accordance to what we have clarified of arguments and what we have narrated of authentic reports.",
    "arabicText": "قال أبو جعفر مصنف هذا الكتاب: الدليل على عصمة الامام أنه لما كان كل كلام ينقل عن قائله يحتمل وجوها من التأويل وكان أكثر القرآن والسنة مما أجمعت الفرق على أنه صحيح لم يغير ولم يبدل ولم يزد فيه ولم ينقص منه محتملا لوجوه كثيرة من التأويل وجب أن يكون مع ذلك مخبر صادق معصوم من تعمد الكذب والغلط، منبئ عما عنى الله ورسوله في الكتاب والسنة على حق ذلك وصدقه، لان الخلق مختلفون في التأويل، كل فرقة تميل مع القرآن والسنة إلى مذهبها، فلو كان الله تبارك وتعالى تركهم بهذه الصفة من غير مخبر عن كتابه صادق فيه لكان قد سوغهم الاختلاف في الدين ودعاهم إليه إذ أنزل كتابا يحتمل التأويل وسن نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله سنة يحتمل التأويل وأمرهم بالعمل بهما، فكأنه قال: تأولوا واعملوا. وفي ذلك إباحة العمل بالمتناقضات والاعتماد للحق وخلافه. فلما استحال ذلك على الله عز وجل وجب أن يكون مع القرآن والسنة في كل عصر من يبين عن المعاني التي عناها الله عز وجل في القرآن بكلامه دون ما يحتمله ألفاظ القرآن من التأويل ويبين عن المعاني التي عناها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في سننه وأخباره دون التأويل الذي يحتمله ألفاظ الاخبار المروية عنه عليه السلام المجمع على صحة نقلها، وإذا وجب أنه لا بد من مخبر صادق وجب أن لا يجوز عليه الكذب تعمدا ولا الغلط فيما يخبر به   عن مراد الله عز وجل في كتابه وعن مراد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في أخباره وسننه، و إذا وجب ذلك وجب أنه معصوم. ومما يؤكد هذا الدليل أنه لا يجوز عند مخالفينا أن يكون الله عز وجل أنزل القرآنعلى أهل عصر النبي صلى عليه وآله ولا نبي فيهم ويتعبدهم بالعمل بما فيه على حقه و صدقه فإذا لم يجز أن ينزل القرآن على قوم ولا ناطق به ولا معبر عنه ولا مفسر لما استعجم منه ولا مبين لوجهه فكذلك لا يجوز أن نتعبد نحن به إلا ومعه من يقوم فينا مقام النبي صلى الله عليه وآله في قومه وأهل عصره في التبيين لناسخه ومنسوخه وخاصه وعامه، و المعاني التي عناها الله عز وجل بكلامه، دون ما يحتمله التأويل، كما كان النبي صلى الله عليه وآله مبينا لذلك كله لأهل عصره ولا بد من ذلك ما لزموا العقول والدين. فإن قال قائل: إن المودي إلينا ما نحتاج إلى علمه من متشابه القرآن ومن معانيه التي عناها الله دون ما يحتمله ألفاظه هو الأمة. أكذبه اختلاف   الأمة وشهادتها بأجمعها على أنفسها في كثير من آي القرآن لجهلهم بمعناه الذي عناه الله عز وجل، وفي ذلك بيان أن الأمة ليست هي المؤدية عن الله عز وجل ببيان القرآن، وأنها ليست تقوم في ذلك مقام النبي صلى الله عليه وآله. فإن تجاسر متجاسر فقال: قد كان يجوز أن ينزل القرآن على أهل عصر النبي صلى الله عليه وآله ولا يكون معه نبي ويتعبدهم بما فيه مع احتماله للتأويل. قيل له: فهب ذلك كان قد وقع   من الخلاف في معانيه ما قد وقع في هذا الوقت ما الذي كانوا يصنعون؟ فإن قال: ما قد صنعوا الساعة. قيل: الذي فعلوه الساعة أخذ كل فرقة من الأمة جانبا من التأويل وعمله عليه وتضليل الفرقة المخالفة لها في ذلك وشهادتها عليها بأنها ليست على الحق. فإن قال: إنه كان يجوز أن يكون أول الاسلام كذلك وإن ذلك حكمة من الله و عدل فيهم. ركب خطأ عظيما وما لا أرى أحدا من الخلق يقدم عليه، فيقال له عند ذلك:فحدثنا إذا تهيأ للعرب الفصحاء أهل اللغة أن يتأولوا القرآن ويعمل كل واحد منهم بما يتأوله على اللغة العربية فكيف يصنع من لا يعرف اللغة من الناس؟ وكيف يصنع العجم من الترك والفرس؟ وإلى أي شئ يرجعون في علم ما فرض الله عليهم في كتابه؟ و من أي الفرق يقبلون مع اختلاف الفرق في التأويل وإباحتك كل فرقة أن تعمل بتأويلها فلا بد لك من أن تجري العجم ومن لا يفهم اللغة مجرى أصحاب اللغة من أن لهم أن يتبعوا أي الفرق شاؤوا. و [إلا] إن ألزمت   من لا يفهم اللغة اتباع بعض الفرق دون بعض لزمك أنت تجعل الحق كله في تلك الفرقة دون غيرها، فإن جعلت الحق في فرقة دون فرقة نقضت ما بنيت عليه كلامك واحتجت إلى أن يكون مع تلك الفرقة علم وحجة تبين بها من غيرها وليس هذا من قولك لو جعلت الفرق كلها متساوية في الحق مع تناقض تأويلاتها فيلزمك أيضا أن تجعل للعجم ومن لا يفهم اللغة أن يتبعوا أي الفرق شاؤوا، وإذا فعلت ذلك لزمك في هذا الوقت أن لا تلزم   أحدا من مخالفيك من الشيعة والخوارج وأصحاب التأويلات وجميع من خالفك ممن له فرقة ومن مبتدع لا فرقة له على مخالفيك ذما  ، وهذا نقض الاسلام والخروج من الاجماع، ويقال لك: وما ينكر على هذا الاعطاء   أن يتعبد الله عز وجل الخلق بما في كتاب مطبق لا يمكن أحدا  أن يقرأ ما فيه ويأمر أن يبحثوا ويرتادوا ويعمل كل فرقة بما ترى أنه في الكتاب. فإن أجزت ذلك أجزت على الله عز وجل العبث لان ذلك صفة العابث، ويلزمك أن تجيز على كل من نظر بعقله في شئ واستحسن أمرا من الدين أن يعتقده لأنه سواء أباحهم أن يعملوا في أصول الحلال و الحرام وفروعها بآرائهم [أ] وأباحهم أن ينظروا بعقولهم في أصول الدين كله وفروعه من توحيده وغيره وأن يعملوا أيضا بما استحسنوه وكان عندهم حقا فإن أجزت ذلك أجزت على الله عز وجل أن يبيح الخلق أن يشهدوا عليه أنه ثاني اثنين، وأن يعتقدوا الدهر، وجحدوا البارئ جل وعز. وهذا آخر ما في هذا الكلام لان من أجاز أن يتعبدنا الله عز وجل بالكتاب على احتمال التأويل ولا مخبر صادق لنا عن معانيه لزمه أن يجيز على أهل عصر النبي صلى الله عليه وآله مثل ذلك وإذا أجاز مثل ذلك لزمه أن يبيح الله عز وجل كل فرقة العمل بما رأت وتأولت لأنه لا يكون لهم غير ذلك إذا لم يكن معهم حجة في أن هذا التأويل أصح من هذا التأويل، وإذا أباح ذلك أباح متبعهم   ممن لا يعرف اللغة وإذا أباح أولئك أيضا لزمه أن يبيحنا في هذا العصر، وإذا أباحنا ذلك في الكتاب لزمه أن يبيحنا ذلك في أصول الحلال والحرام ومقائس العقول وذلك خروج من الدين كله، وإذا وجب بما قدمنا ذكره أنه لا بد من مترجم عن القرآن وأخبار النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وجب أن يكون معصوما ليجب القبول منه، فإذا وجب أن يكون معصوما بطل أن يكون هو الأمة لما بينا من اختلافاتها في تأويل القرآن والاخبار وتنازعها في ذلك ومن إكفار بعضها بعضا، وإذا ثبت ذلك وجب أن المعصوم هو الواحد الذي ذكرناه وهو الامام. وقد دللنا على أن الامام لا يكون إلا معصوما وأرينا أنه إذا وجبت العصمة في الامام لم يكن بد من أن ينص النبي صلى الله عليه وآله عليه لان العصمة ليست في ظاهر الخلقة فيعرفها الخلق بالمشاهدة فواجب أن ينص عليها علام الغيوب تبارك وتعالى على لسان نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله وذلك لان الامام لا يكون إلا منصوصا عليه. وقد صح لنا النص بما بيناه من الحجج وبما رويناه من الأخبار الصحيحة.",

And whoever embraces a forbidden woman will be chained with a shackle of fire alongside a devil, and both will be cast into the Fire.\"\n\"Whoever cheats a Muslim in buying or selling is not from us and will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment with the Jews, for they are the most deceitful people towards Muslims.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) forbade anyone from withholding necessary items (ma'oon) from his neighbour and said:\n\"Whoever withholds useful items from his neighbour, Allah (swt) will withhold His (swt) goodness from him on the Day of Judgment and will leave him to his own self.

Even if she fasts during the day, prays during the night, frees slaves, and spends in the way of Allah (swt) by supporting horses for jihad, she will still be among the first to enter the Fire - unless she seeks his satisfaction. Likewise, the same applies to a man if he wrongs his wife.\"\n\"Beware! Whoever slaps the cheek or face of a Muslim, Allah (swt) will scatter his bones on the Day of Judgment, and he will be resurrected in chains until he is thrown into Hell - unless he repents.\"\n\"Whoever sleeps with malice in his heart towards his Muslim brother, he sleeps under the wrath of Allah (swt) and will awaken in the same state until he repents.\"\nHe (sw) also forbade backbiting and said: \"Whoever backbites a Muslim, his fast becomes void, his ablution is invalidated, and he will come on the Day of Judgment with a stench emanating from his mouth more foul than that of a decaying corpse, causing discomfort to the people at the gathering. If he dies before repenting, he dies considering lawful what Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt), peace be upon him and his family, said:\n\"Whoever suppresses his anger while being capable of acting upon it and chooses patience, Allah (swt) will grant him the reward of a martyr.\"\n\"Beware! Whoever defends his brother in his absence when he hears someone backbiting him in a gathering, Allah (swt) will turn away from him a thousand doors of harm in this world and the Hereafter. But if he does not defend him while being capable of doing so, he will bear the sin of backbiting seventy times.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) also forbade betrayal and said:\n\"Whoever betrays a trust in this world and does not return it to its rightful owner, then death overtakes him, he will die outside of my faith and will meet Allah (swt) while He is angry with him.\"\nHe (sw) further said: \"Whoever gives false testimony against someone will be hung by his tongue among the hypocrites in the lowest depths of Hell.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt), peace be upon him and his family, said: \"Whoever purchases something that was acquired through betrayal, knowing its origin, is like the one who committed the betrayal.\"\n\"Whoever withholds a rightful due from his Muslim brother, Allah (swt) will deprive him of the blessings of sustenance - unless he repents.\"\n\"Beware! Whoever hears of an indecent act and spreads it is like the one who committed it.\"\n\"Whoever's Muslim brother is in need of a loan and he has the means but refuses to help, Allah (swt) will forbid him from the fragrance of Paradise.\"\n\"Beware! Whoever patiently endures the bad character of his wife and seeks reward for it, Allah (swt) will grant him the reward of the grateful ones.\"\n\"Beware! Any woman who does not treat her husband kindly and burdens him with what he cannot bear or handle, Allah (swt) will not accept any of her good deeds, and she will meet Allah (swt) while He is angry with her.\"\n\"Beware!

For every step he takes, he will receive forty thousand good deeds, forty thousand sins will be erased from him, and his rank will be elevated by forty thousand degrees. It will be as if he worshiped Allah (swt) for one hundred years with patience and seeking reward.\"\n\"Whoever fulfills the need of a blind person from the needs of this world and walks with him until Allah (swt) fulfills his need, Allah (swt) will grant him freedom from hypocrisy and freedom from the Fire, fulfill seventy of his worldly needs, and he will continue to be immersed in Allah's (swt) mercy until he returns.\"\n\"Whoever falls ill for a day and night and does not complain to his visitors, Allah (swt) will raise him on the Day of Judgment with His close friend, Ibrahim, the Friend of the Most Merciful (as), allowing him to cross the bridge (Sirat) like a flashing lightning bolt.\"\n\"Whoever strives to fulfill the need of a sick person - whether he completes it or not - will leave his sins as pure as the day his mother gave birth to him.\"\nA man from the Ansar said: \"May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O' Messenger of Allah (swt)! If the sick person is from his own household, isn't that more rewarding when he strives to fulfill their need?\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) replied: \"Yes! Indeed, whoever relieves a believer of a worldly hardship, Allah (swt) will relieve him of seventy-two hardships in the Hereafter and seventy-two hardships in this world, the least of which is Abdominal pain.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Whoever delays giving the due right to someone while being capable of fulfilling it, every day that passes upon him will be recorded as the sin of a tax collector (oppressor).\"\n\"Beware! Whoever hangs a whip before a tyrannical ruler (to intimidate others), Allah (swt) will turn that whip into a serpent of fire on the Day of Judgment, seventy cubits long, which Allah (swt) will unleash upon him in the Fire of Hell - and what a terrible destination!\"\n\"Whoever does a good deed for his brother but then reminds him of it (to boast), Allah (swt) will nullify his good deed, record his sin, and will not reward him for his effort.\"\nThen he (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'I have forbidden Paradise to the one who reminds others of his favors, the miser, and the tale-bearer (slanderer).'\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Indeed, whoever gives charity, for every dirham he donates, he will receive in return the equivalent of Mount Uhud from the blessings of Paradise. And whoever personally delivers charity to a needy person will have the same reward as the giver, without the giver's reward being diminished in the slightest.\"\n\"Whoever offers the funeral prayer (Salat Al-Janazah) for a deceased person, seventy thousand angels will pray for him, and Allah (swt) will forgive his past and future sins. If he remains until the deceased is buried and the earth is placed over him, for every step he takes, he will earn a qirat of reward, and one qirat is like Mount Uhud.\"\n\"Whoever sheds tears out of fear of Allah (swt), for every drop of his tears, Allah (swt) will build for him a palace in Paradise adorned with pearls and jewels, filled with what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined.\"\n\"Whoever walks to the mosque seeking to join the congregation, for every step he takes, seventy thousand good deeds will be recorded for him, and his rank will be raised by the same number. If he dies in this state, Allah (swt) will appoint seventy thousand angels to visit him in his grave, to give him glad tidings, comfort him in his loneliness, and seek forgiveness for him until he is resurrected.\"\n\"Whoever calls the Adhan (the call to prayer) sincerely, seeking Allah's (swt) pleasure, Allah (swt) will reward him with the reward of forty thousand martyrs and forty thousand truthful ones (siddeeqin), and through his intercession, forty thousand sinners from my nation will enter Paradise.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Whoever says: 'I bear witness that there is no God but Allah (swt),' seventy thousand angels will send blessings upon him and seek forgiveness for him. On the Day of Judgment, he will be under the shade of the Throne until Allah (swt) completes the reckoning of all creation. And whoever says: 'I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (swt),' forty thousand angels will write the reward for his statement.\"\n\"Whoever maintains the first row (in prayer) and safeguards the first Takbir (opening declaration of prayer) without harming any Muslim, Allah (swt) will grant him the reward equal to that of the callers to prayer (Mu'adhins) in this world and the hereafter.\"\n\"Whoever takes responsibility over a group of people (leadership) will be brought on the Day of Judgment with his hands chained to his neck. If he governed them according to Allah's (swt) command, Allah (swt) will release him. But if he ruled unjustly, he will be cast into the Fire of Hell, and what an evil destination it is.\"\nThe Prophet (peace be upon him and his family) also said: \"Do not belittle any act of evil, even if it seems small in your eyes, and do not think lightly of any act of goodness, even if it appears great in your eyes. For there is no major sin with repentance, and no minor sin with persistence.\"\nShuayb ibn Waqid said: \"I asked Husayn ibn Zayd about the length of this narration, and he replied: ' Imam Jafar ibn Muhammad Al-Sadiq (as) ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) narrated to me that Imam (as) compiled this narration from the book that was dictated by the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) and written in the handwriting of  Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as).'\"",

Even if she fasts during the day, prays during the night, frees slaves, and spends in the way of Allah (swt) by supporting horses for jihad, she will still be among the first to enter the Fire - unless she seeks his satisfaction. Likewise, the same applies to a man if he wrongs his wife.\"\n\"Beware! Whoever slaps the cheek or face of a Muslim, Allah (swt) will scatter his bones on the Day of Judgment, and he will be resurrected in chains until he is thrown into Hell - unless he repents.\"\n\"Whoever sleeps with malice in his heart towards his Muslim brother, he sleeps under the wrath of Allah (swt) and will awaken in the same state until he repents.\"\nHe (sw) also forbade backbiting and said: \"Whoever backbites a Muslim, his fast becomes void, his ablution is invalidated, and he will come on the Day of Judgment with a stench emanating from his mouth more foul than that of a decaying corpse, causing discomfort to the people at the gathering.

Whoever honors his Muslim brother is indeed honoring Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) also forbade a man from leading a group in prayer without their permission and said:\n\"Whoever leads a group in prayer with their permission, and they are pleased with him, and he is moderate in leading them - perfecting his prayer with proper standing, recitation, bowing, prostration, and sitting - will receive a reward equal to theirs, without their reward being diminished in the least.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Whoever goes to visit a relative, using himself and his wealth to maintain family ties, Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, will grant him the reward of one hundred martyrs. For every step he takes, he will receive forty thousand good deeds, forty thousand sins will be erased from him, and his rank will be elevated by forty thousand degrees. It will be as if he worshiped Allah (swt) for one hundred years with patience and seeking reward.\"\n\"Whoever fulfills the need of a blind person from the needs of this world and walks with him until Allah (swt) fulfills his need, Allah (swt) will grant him freedom from hypocrisy and freedom from the Fire, fulfill seventy of his worldly needs, and he will continue to be immersed in Allah's (swt) mercy until he returns.\"\n\"Whoever falls ill for a day and night and does not complain to his visitors, Allah (swt) will raise him on the Day of Judgment with His close friend, Ibrahim, the Friend of the Most Merciful (as), allowing him to cross the bridge (Sirat) like a flashing lightning bolt.\"\n\"Whoever strives to fulfill the need of a sick person - whether he completes it or not - will leave his sins as pure as the day his mother gave birth to him.\"\nA man from the Ansar said: \"May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O' Messenger of Allah (swt)! If the sick person is from his own household, isn't that more rewarding when he strives to fulfill their need?\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) replied: \"Yes! Indeed, whoever relieves a believer of a worldly hardship, Allah (swt) will relieve him of seventy-two hardships in the Hereafter and seventy-two hardships in this world, the least of which is Abdominal pain.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Whoever delays giving the due right to someone while being capable of fulfilling it, every day that passes upon him will be recorded as the sin of a tax collector (oppressor).\"\n\"Beware! Whoever hangs a whip before a tyrannical ruler (to intimidate others), Allah (swt) will turn that whip into a serpent of fire on the Day of Judgment, seventy cubits long, which Allah (swt) will unleash upon him in the Fire of Hell - and what a terrible destination!\"\n\"Whoever does a good deed for his brother but then reminds him of it (to boast), Allah (swt) will nullify his good deed, record his sin, and will not reward him for his effort.\"\nThen he (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'I have forbidden Paradise to the one who reminds others of his favors, the miser, and the tale-bearer (slanderer).'\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Indeed, whoever gives charity, for every dirham he donates, he will receive in return the equivalent of Mount Uhud from the blessings of Paradise.

    "englishText": "Hadith.5150 - Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Fadhal narrated from Zharif ibn Nasih from Abdullah ibn Ayyub, who said Al-Husayn Al-Rawwasi narrated to me from Ibn Abi Umayr, the physician, who said: I presented this narration to Abu Abdullah (as), and Imam(as) said:\n\"Yes, it is true. Indeed, the Commander of the Faithful (as) used to instruct his officials with this.\"\nHe said:\n\"Imam (as) gave a ruling that for every bone that contains marrow, there is a specified obligatory compensation if it is broken and healed without any defect or flaw.\nImam (as) divided the obligatory blood money (diyyah) into six parts and established for wounds, the fetus, the eyelashes, paralysis, limbs, and the thumb, assigning six categories for each.\nFetus\nHe set the blood money for a fetus at one hundred dinars.\nFor the sperm of a man until it becomes a fetus, he set five parts, and when it becomes a fetus before the soul enters it, he set it at one hundred dinars.\nHe allocated twenty dinars for the sperm drop (nutfah), which refers to a man discharging with his wife who does not desire it. Thus, the Commander of the Faithful (as) set this ruling for it.\"\nHe (as) set the compensation for the nutfah (sperm drop) at twenty dinars, which is equivalent to one-fifth (khumus), and for the clot of blood (alaqah), he set it at two-fifths of that, forty dinars. This ruling also applies if a woman is struck or harmed and subsequently miscarries.\n- For the muḍghah (chewed-like lump of flesh), he established sixty dinars if she also miscarried under similar circumstances.\n- For the bone stage (idham), he set eighty dinars if the woman miscarried.\n- For the fully formed fetus (janin), he set one hundred dinars if an enemy attacked them, causing the women to miscarry. He obligated this compensation upon the women from the responsible family (aqilah) accordingly.\nIf a child is born alive and cries (istihlal, the first cry), and they were attacked during the night, leading to the killing of the children, the compensation for each male child is one thousand dinars, and for each female child, it is calculated accordingly at five hundred dinars.\nAs for a woman who is killed while pregnant with a fully formed fetus, and the fetus does not miscarry, and it is unknown whether the fetus is male or female, and whether it died before or after the mother, then the compensation for the fetus is half of the male blood money and half of the female blood money, while the woman's full blood money remains obligatory.\nHe (as) also ruled regarding a man who discharges outside his wife during intercourse without her consent. In this case, he imposed half of one-fifth of the fetus's blood money, amounting to ten dinars.\nIf he discharges inside her without her consent, the compensation is twenty dinars.\nHe established retaliation (qisas) for injuries and the related compensation according to the extent of the blood money, which is one hundred dinars.\nHe ruled on the blood money for fetal injuries proportionally from the scale of one hundred dinars, corresponding to what applies to the injuries of a man or a woman in full.\nSensory Organs and Paralysis\nHe (as) also gave rulings concerning the body.\nHe (as) established six obligatory compensations: life (nafs), vision (baṣar), hearing (samʿ), speech (kalam), impairment of voice due to nasal sound (ghanan) or hoarseness (bahah), and paralysis of the hands and legs.\nHe aligned these rulings with the same principles as the previous laws. Additionally, he prescribed the practice of qasamah (oath-taking) for each of these matters, proportional to the amount of blood money owed.\nFor intentional murder, qasamah involves fifty men, and for accidental killing, twenty-five men, corresponding to the blood money of one thousand dinars for life.\nFor wounds requiring qasamah, six people are involved, and anything less follows this calculation.\nThe qasamah applies to life, hearing, vision, intellect, voice due to hoarseness or harshness, and the loss of hands and legs. These are the six major parts of a person.\nDiyyah - Blood Money\nThe blood money for;\n- a life is one thousand dinars,\n- for the Nose (if completely severed) one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete Total loss of voice (ghanan or bahah) one thousand dinars,\n- for paralysis of both hands one thousand dinars,\n- for the total loss of hearing one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete loss of vision one thousand dinars,\n- for loss of both legs together one thousand dinars,\n- for the Total removal of both lips one thousand dinars,\n- for a severe bent hunchback of the back thousand dinars,\n- for the Complete severance of the male genital organ one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete removal of the tongue one thousand dinars,\n- for Loss of both testicles one thousand dinars.\nInjuries; amputation, fractures, cracks, depressions, open wounds (muḍihah), bleeding wounds (damiyah), dislocation of bones, and deep wounds (naqibah)\nHe (as) also established the compensation for injuries to all body parts - whether on the head, face, or the rest of the body - including the senses of hearing, vision, and voice.\nHe (as) also established rulings for the intellect (Aql), the hands, and the legs concerning cases of amputation, fractures, cracks, depressions, open wounds (muḍihah), bleeding wounds (damiyah), dislocation of bones, and deep wounds (naqibah).\nIf a bone is broken and heals without any deformity or defect and without any bone being displaced, its compensation is clearly defined.\nIn the case of an open wound (muḍihah) where the bone is exposed but not displaced, both the compensation for the fracture and the open wound are due.\nFor every bone that is broken, there is a set compensation, and for the dislocation of bones, half of the compensation for a fracture is due.\nThe compensation for a visible wound (mudihah) is one-fourth of the compensation for a fracture, particularly for those body parts covered by clothing, except for the two forearm bones (qaṣabatay Al-saʿid) and the fingers.\nFor an ulcer (qarhah) that does not heal, the compensation is one-third of the blood money of the bone where the ulcer is located.\nVision\nIf a man suffers an injury to one of his eyes, its compensation is measured by placing an eggshell over the injured eye and determining the range of vision of the healthy eye. Then, the healthy eye is covered, and the range of vision of the injured eye is assessed. Compensation is calculated based on this comparison.\nThe practice of qasamah (oath-taking) applies in these six categories, involving six individuals according to the degree of injury to the eye.\n- If one-sixth of the vision is lost, the individual alone swears an oath and receives the compensation.\n- If one-third of the vision is lost, he and another man swear and receive the compensation.\n- If half of the vision is lost, he and two other men swear.\n- If two-thirds of the vision is lost, he and three other men swear.\n- If four-fifths of his vision was lost, he would swear an oath along with four other men.\n- If all of his vision was lost, he would swear an oath along with five other men.\nThis was the ruling of qasamah (oath-taking) in the matter of the eye.\nHe (as) also ruled that if someone had no one to swear an oath with him and he was not trusted regarding the extent of his vision loss, the number of oaths he would take would be increased.\n- If one-sixth of his vision was lost, he would swear once;\n- if one-third, he would swear twice;\n- if half, he would swear three times;\n- if two-thirds, he would swear four times;\n- if five-sixths, he would swear five times;\n- and if all of his vision was lost, he would swear six times, after which he would be granted compensation.\nHowever, if he refused to swear, he would only be granted compensation corresponding to what he had sworn for and was trusted upon.\nThe governor (wali) would assist in this matter by investigating, questioning, and verifying in cases of retaliation (qisas), legal punishments (hudud), and equivalent retribution (qawad).\nHearing\nIf a person suffered any harm to his hearing, a similar method would be applied. An object would be used to measure the extent of his hearing loss, and compensation would be determined accordingly. If all of his hearing was lost, it would be handled in the same manner.\nIf there was suspicion of dishonesty, the individual would be left alone until he was caught off-guard, then someone would call out to him. If he responded, his opponents would bring the case back to the judge. The judge would act based on his judgment and could reduce part of the compensation taken.\nThigh or Upper Arm\nIf the damage was in the thigh (fakhidh) or upper arm (Aḍud), it would be measured with a thread by comparing the healthy leg or arm to the injured one to determine the extent of the loss. If the injury was to the shin (saq) or forearm (saʿid), the comparison would be made using the thigh or upper arm.\nThe judge would assess the extent of the injury to the thigh.\nTemple\nHe (as) ruled that if a man sustained an Injury to the Temple (Ṣudgh), causing him to be unable to turn his head except by shifting his entire body, half of the full blood money (diyyah) was due, which is five hundred dinars. If the injury was less severe, the compensation would be calculated accordingly.\nUpper Eyelid\nHe (as) ruled that if the Upper Eyelid (Shufr Al-Ayn Al-Ala) was injured and split, its compensation was one-third of the blood money for the eye, amounting to one hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nLower Eyelid\nIf the Lower Eyelid (Shufr Al-Ayn Al-Asfal) was injured, its compensation was half of the blood money for the eye, which is two hundred fifty dinars.\nEyebrow\nIf the eyebrow (Al-hajib) was injured and all its hair was lost, the compensation was half of the blood money for the eye, amounting to two hundred fifty dinars. For any partial damage, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nNasal Cartilage\nIf the Nasal Cartilage (Rawthah Al-Anf) of the nose was cut off, the compensation was five hundred dinars, which is half of the full blood money.\nThe compiler of this book (may Allah (swt) have mercy on him) explained that the rawthah is the soft, flexible part of the nose.\nNose\nIf there was a penetrating wound in the Nose (Nafidhah) that could not heal, caused by an arrow or spear, the compensation was three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nHowever, if the wound healed completely, the compensation was one-fifth of the blood money for the rawthah of the nose, which is one hundred dinars, with proportional compensation for lesser injuries.\nIf the penetrating wound affected one nostril and extended to the nasal septum (khayshoom), the divider between the nostrils, the compensation was one-tenth of the blood money for the rawthah, which is fifty dinars because the septum represents half.\nIf a projectile passed through one nostril, the septum, and exited through the other nostril, the compensation was sixty-six dinars.\nUpper Lip\nIf the Upper Lip (Al-Shafah Al-Ulya) was completely cut off, its compensation was half of the full blood money, amounting to five hundred dinars.\nFor any portion that was cut, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nIf the upper lip was split and the teeth became visible but the wound healed and closed, the compensation for the injury was one-fifth of the blood money for the lip, which is one hundred dinars. The compensation for any portion of it would be determined accordingly.\nIf the lip was split and became severely disfigured, its compensation was one hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nThe compiler of this book (may Allah (swt) have mercy on him) explained that shatar refers to the splitting of the lip from its lower part, either naturally or due to an injury. A lip in such a condition is referred to as shafah shatraa.\nLower Lip\nIf the Lower Lip (Al-Shafah Al-Sufla) was completely cut off, its compensation was two-thirds of the full blood money, amounting to six hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nFor any part of it that was cut, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nIf it was split, exposing the teeth, and then healed and closed, the compensation was one hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nIf the injury caused severe and ugly disfigurement, the compensation was three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nI asked Abu Jafar Imam Muhammad ibn Ali Al-Baqir (as) about this, and he said: \"It has reached us that the Commander of the Faithful (as) favored the lower lip in compensation because it holds water and food along with the teeth. For this reason, he gave it greater compensation in his rulings.\"\nCheek\nIf there was a penetrating wound in the Cheek (Al-Khadd) that exposed the inside of the mouth, its compensation was one hundred dinars.\nIf the wound healed but left a clear and severe disfigurement, the compensation was fifty dinars.\nIf both cheeks had penetrating wounds, the compensation was one hundred dinars, which is half the compensation for a wound that exposes the mouth.\nWounds with Blades or Arrows\nIf a sharp object, like an arrowhead, became lodged in the bone and penetrated to the palate, the compensation was one hundred fifty dinars - fifty dinars for the visible wound (mudihah) and the rest for the deeper injury.\nIf it was a deep wound (naqibah) that did not fully penetrate, the compensation was one hundred dinars.\nFor any visible wound (mudihah) on the face, the compensation was fifty dinars.\nIf this wound caused disfigurement, the compensation for the disfigurement was one-fourth of the blood money for the visible wound.\nIf there was a wound that did not expose the bone but healed, leaving a scar on the cheeks, the compensation was ten dinars.\nHead and Skull Injuries\nIf there was a fracture (ṣadʿ) in the face, the compensation was eighty dinars.\nIf a piece of flesh fell off without exposing the bone, about the size of a dirham or larger, the compensation was thirty dinars.\nFor a wound that exposed the bone (mudihah) on the body, the compensation was forty dinars, and for the same injury on the head, it was fifty dinars.\nIf the bone was displaced due to the injury, the compensation was one hundred fifty dinars.\nIf there was a penetrating skull wound (naqibah) reaching the brain, known as ma'mumah, and the compensation was one-third of the full blood money, amounting to three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nTeeth Injuries\nFor each tooth that was lost, the compensation was fifty dinars, and all teeth were treated equally in compensation;\n- the compensation for the central incisor (thaniyyah) was set at fifty dinars.\n- the compensation for the lateral incisor (rabaʿiyyah) was forty dinars,\n- for the canine tooth (nawb) it was thirty dinars,\n- and for the molar tooth (dars) it was twenty-five dinars.\n- If a tooth turned black within a year but did not fall out, its compensation was equal to that of a

from the fifty dinars.\n- If the tooth later fell out while it was blackened, the compensation was twenty-five dinars.\n- If it was cracked while blackened, the compensation was twelve and a half dinars.\n- For any portion that broke off, the compensation was calculated proportionally from the twenty-five dinars.\nCollarbone (Tarquwah) Injuries\nRegarding the collarbone (tarquwah);\n- if it was broken and healed without any deformity or defect, the compensation was forty dinars.\n- If it was fractured, the compensation was four-fifths of the full compensation for its break, which is

ten dinars.\nShoulder (Mankib) Injuries\nThe compensation for a broken shoulder (mankib) was set at one-fifth of the blood money for the hand, amounting to one hundred dinars.\n- If there was a fracture (ṣadʿ) in the shoulder, the compensation was four-fifths of the compensation for its break, which is eighty dinars.\n- If there was a visible wound (muḍihah), the compensation was one-fourth of the compensation for its break, totaling twenty-five dinars.\n- If the bones were displaced, the compensation was one hundred seventy-five dinars, divided as follows: one hundred dinars for the

    "thaqalaynSanad": "Hadith.5150 - Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Fadhal narrated from Zharif ibn Nasih from Abdullah ibn Ayyub, who said Al-Husayn Al-Rawwasi narrated to me from Ibn Abi Umayr, the physician, who said: I presented this narration to Abu Abdullah (as), and Imam(as) said:\n",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "\"Yes, it is true. Indeed, the Commander of the Faithful (as) used to instruct his officials with this.\"\nHe said:\n\"Imam (as) gave a ruling that for every bone that contains marrow, there is a specified obligatory compensation if it is broken and healed without any defect or flaw.\nImam (as) divided the obligatory blood money (diyyah) into six parts and established for wounds, the fetus, the eyelashes, paralysis, limbs, and the thumb, assigning six categories for each.\nFetus\nHe set the blood money for a fetus at one hundred dinars.\nFor the sperm of a man until it becomes a fetus, he set five parts, and when it becomes a fetus before the soul enters it, he set it at one hundred dinars.\nHe allocated twenty dinars for the sperm drop (nutfah), which refers to a man discharging with his wife who does not desire it. Thus, the Commander of the Faithful (as) set this ruling for it.\"\nHe (as) set the compensation for the nutfah (sperm drop) at twenty dinars, which is equivalent to one-fifth (khumus), and for the clot of blood (alaqah), he set it at two-fifths of that, forty dinars. This ruling also applies if a woman is struck or harmed and subsequently miscarries.\n- For the muḍghah (chewed-like lump of flesh), he established sixty dinars if she also miscarried under similar circumstances.\n- For the bone stage (idham), he set eighty dinars if the woman miscarried.\n- For the fully formed fetus (janin), he set one hundred dinars if an enemy attacked them, causing the women to miscarry. He obligated this compensation upon the women from the responsible family (aqilah) accordingly.\nIf a child is born alive and cries (istihlal, the first cry), and they were attacked during the night, leading to the killing of the children, the compensation for each male child is one thousand dinars, and for each female child, it is calculated accordingly at five hundred dinars.\nAs for a woman who is killed while pregnant with a fully formed fetus, and the fetus does not miscarry, and it is unknown whether the fetus is male or female, and whether it died before or after the mother, then the compensation for the fetus is half of the male blood money and half of the female blood money, while the woman's full blood money remains obligatory.\nHe (as) also ruled regarding a man who discharges outside his wife during intercourse without her consent. In this case, he imposed half of one-fifth of the fetus's blood money, amounting to ten dinars.\nIf he discharges inside her without her consent, the compensation is twenty dinars.\nHe established retaliation (qisas) for injuries and the related compensation according to the extent of the blood money, which is one hundred dinars.\nHe ruled on the blood money for fetal injuries proportionally from the scale of one hundred dinars, corresponding to what applies to the injuries of a man or a woman in full.\nSensory Organs and Paralysis\nHe (as) also gave rulings concerning the body.\nHe (as) established six obligatory compensations: life (nafs), vision (baṣar), hearing (samʿ), speech (kalam), impairment of voice due to nasal sound (ghanan) or hoarseness (bahah), and paralysis of the hands and legs.\nHe aligned these rulings with the same principles as the previous laws. Additionally, he prescribed the practice of qasamah (oath-taking) for each of these matters, proportional to the amount of blood money owed.\nFor intentional murder, qasamah involves fifty men, and for accidental killing, twenty-five men, corresponding to the blood money of one thousand dinars for life.\nFor wounds requiring qasamah, six people are involved, and anything less follows this calculation.\nThe qasamah applies to life, hearing, vision, intellect, voice due to hoarseness or harshness, and the loss of hands and legs. These are the six major parts of a person.\nDiyyah - Blood Money\nThe blood money for;\n- a life is one thousand dinars,\n- for the Nose (if completely severed) one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete Total loss of voice (ghanan or bahah) one thousand dinars,\n- for paralysis of both hands one thousand dinars,\n- for the total loss of hearing one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete loss of vision one thousand dinars,\n- for loss of both legs together one thousand dinars,\n- for the Total removal of both lips one thousand dinars,\n- for a severe bent hunchback of the back thousand dinars,\n- for the Complete severance of the male genital organ one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete removal of the tongue one thousand dinars,\n- for Loss of both testicles one thousand dinars.\nInjuries; amputation, fractures, cracks, depressions, open wounds (muḍihah), bleeding wounds (damiyah), dislocation of bones, and deep wounds (naqibah)\nHe (as) also established the compensation for injuries to all body parts - whether on the head, face, or the rest of the body - including the senses of hearing, vision, and voice.\nHe (as) also established rulings for the intellect (Aql), the hands, and the legs concerning cases of amputation, fractures, cracks, depressions, open wounds (muḍihah), bleeding wounds (damiyah), dislocation of bones, and deep wounds (naqibah).\nIf a bone is broken and heals without any deformity or defect and without any bone being displaced, its compensation is clearly defined.\nIn the case of an open wound (muḍihah) where the bone is exposed but not displaced, both the compensation for the fracture and the open wound are due.\nFor every bone that is broken, there is a set compensation, and for the dislocation of bones, half of the compensation for a fracture is due.\nThe compensation for a visible wound (mudihah) is one-fourth of the compensation for a fracture, particularly for those body parts covered by clothing, except for the two forearm bones (qaṣabatay Al-saʿid) and the fingers.\nFor an ulcer (qarhah) that does not heal, the compensation is one-third of the blood money of the bone where the ulcer is located.\nVision\nIf a man suffers an injury to one of his eyes, its compensation is measured by placing an eggshell over the injured eye and determining the range of vision of the healthy eye. Then, the healthy eye is covered, and the range of vision of the injured eye is assessed. Compensation is calculated based on this comparison.\nThe practice of qasamah (oath-taking) applies in these six categories, involving six individuals according to the degree of injury to the eye.\n- If one-sixth of the vision is lost, the individual alone swears an oath and receives the compensation.\n- If one-third of the vision is lost, he and another man swear and receive the compensation.\n- If half of the vision is lost, he and two other men swear.\n- If two-thirds of the vision is lost, he and three other men swear.\n- If four-fifths of his vision was lost, he would swear an oath along with four other men.\n- If all of his vision was lost, he would swear an oath along with five other men.\nThis was the ruling of qasamah (oath-taking) in the matter of the eye.\nHe (as) also ruled that if someone had no one to swear an oath with him and he was not trusted regarding the extent of his vision loss, the number of oaths he would take would be increased.\n- If one-sixth of his vision was lost, he would swear once;\n- if one-third, he would swear twice;\n- if half, he would swear three times;\n- if two-thirds, he would swear four times;\n- if five-sixths, he would swear five times;\n- and if all of his vision was lost, he would swear six times, after which he would be granted compensation.\nHowever, if he refused to swear, he would only be granted compensation corresponding to what he had sworn for and was trusted upon.\nThe governor (wali) would assist in this matter by investigating, questioning, and verifying in cases of retaliation (qisas), legal punishments (hudud), and equivalent retribution (qawad).\nHearing\nIf a person suffered any harm to his hearing, a similar method would be applied. An object would be used to measure the extent of his hearing loss, and compensation would be determined accordingly. If all of his hearing was lost, it would be handled in the same manner.\nIf there was suspicion of dishonesty, the individual would be left alone until he was caught off-guard, then someone would call out to him. If he responded, his opponents would bring the case back to the judge. The judge would act based on his judgment and could reduce part of the compensation taken.\nThigh or Upper Arm\nIf the damage was in the thigh (fakhidh) or upper arm (Aḍud), it would be measured with a thread by comparing the healthy leg or arm to the injured one to determine the extent of the loss. If the injury was to the shin (saq) or forearm (saʿid), the comparison would be made using the thigh or upper arm.\nThe judge would assess the extent of the injury to the thigh.\nTemple\nHe (as) ruled that if a man sustained an Injury to the Temple (Ṣudgh), causing him to be unable to turn his head except by shifting his entire body, half of the full blood money (diyyah) was due, which is five hundred dinars. If the injury was less severe, the compensation would be calculated accordingly.\nUpper Eyelid\nHe (as) ruled that if the Upper Eyelid (Shufr Al-Ayn Al-Ala) was injured and split, its compensation was one-third of the blood money for the eye, amounting to one hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nLower Eyelid\nIf the Lower Eyelid (Shufr Al-Ayn Al-Asfal) was injured, its compensation was half of the blood money for the eye, which is two hundred fifty dinars.\nEyebrow\nIf the eyebrow (Al-hajib) was injured and all its hair was lost, the compensation was half of the blood money for the eye, amounting to two hundred fifty dinars. For any partial damage, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nNasal Cartilage\nIf the Nasal Cartilage (Rawthah Al-Anf) of the nose was cut off, the compensation was five hundred dinars, which is half of the full blood money.\nThe compiler of this book (may Allah (swt) have mercy on him) explained that the rawthah is the soft, flexible part of the nose.\nNose\nIf there was a penetrating wound in the Nose (Nafidhah) that could not heal, caused by an arrow or spear, the compensation was three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nHowever, if the wound healed completely, the compensation was one-fifth of the blood money for the rawthah of the nose, which is one hundred dinars, with proportional compensation for lesser injuries.\nIf the penetrating wound affected one nostril and extended to the nasal septum (khayshoom), the divider between the nostrils, the compensation was one-tenth of the blood money for the rawthah, which is fifty dinars because the septum represents half.\nIf a projectile passed through one nostril, the septum, and exited through the other nostril, the compensation was sixty-six dinars.\nUpper Lip\nIf the Upper Lip (Al-Shafah Al-Ulya) was completely cut off, its compensation was half of the full blood money, amounting to five hundred dinars.\nFor any portion that was cut, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nIf the upper lip was split and the teeth became visible but the wound healed and closed, the compensation for the injury was one-fifth of the blood money for the lip, which is one hundred dinars. The compensation for any portion of it would be determined accordingly.\nIf the lip was split and became severely disfigured, its compensation was one hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nThe compiler of this book (may Allah (swt) have mercy on him) explained that shatar refers to the splitting of the lip from its lower part, either naturally or due to an injury. A lip in such a condition is referred to as shafah shatraa.\nLower Lip\nIf the Lower Lip (Al-Shafah Al-Sufla) was completely cut off, its compensation was two-thirds of the full blood money, amounting to six hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nFor any part of it that was cut, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nIf it was split, exposing the teeth, and then healed and closed, the compensation was one hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nIf the injury caused severe and ugly disfigurement, the compensation was three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nI asked Abu Jafar Imam Muhammad ibn Ali Al-Baqir (as) about this, and he said: \"It has reached us that the Commander of the Faithful (as) favored the lower lip in compensation because it holds water and food along with the teeth. For this reason, he gave it greater compensation in his rulings.\"\nCheek\nIf there was a penetrating wound in the Cheek (Al-Khadd) that exposed the inside of the mouth, its compensation was one hundred dinars.\nIf the wound healed but left a clear and severe disfigurement, the compensation was fifty dinars.\nIf both cheeks had penetrating wounds, the compensation was one hundred dinars, which is half the compensation for a wound that exposes the mouth.\nWounds with Blades or Arrows\nIf a sharp object, like an arrowhead, became lodged in the bone and penetrated to the palate, the compensation was one hundred fifty dinars - fifty dinars for the visible wound (mudihah) and the rest for the deeper injury.\nIf it was a deep wound (naqibah) that did not fully penetrate, the compensation was one hundred dinars.\nFor any visible wound (mudihah) on the face, the compensation was fifty dinars.\nIf this wound caused disfigurement, the compensation for the disfigurement was one-fourth of the blood money for the visible wound.\nIf there was a wound that did not expose the bone but healed, leaving a scar on the cheeks, the compensation was ten dinars.\nHead and Skull Injuries\nIf there was a fracture (ṣadʿ) in the face, the compensation was eighty dinars.\nIf a piece of flesh fell off without exposing the bone, about the size of a dirham or larger, the compensation was thirty dinars.\nFor a wound that exposed the bone (mudihah) on the body, the compensation was forty dinars, and for the same injury on the head, it was fifty dinars.\nIf the bone was displaced due to the injury, the compensation was one hundred fifty dinars.\nIf there was a penetrating skull wound (naqibah) reaching the brain, known as ma'mumah, and the compensation was one-third of the full blood money, amounting to three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nTeeth Injuries\nFor each tooth that was lost, the compensation was fifty dinars, and all teeth were treated equally in compensation;\n- the compensation for the central incisor (thaniyyah) was set at fifty dinars.\n- the compensation for the lateral incisor (rabaʿiyyah) was forty dinars,\n- for the canine tooth (nawb) it was thirty dinars,\n- and for the molar tooth (dars) it was twenty-five dinars.\n- If a tooth turned black within a year but did not fall out, its compensation was equal to that of a

from the fifty dinars.\n- If the tooth later fell out while it was blackened, the compensation was twenty-five dinars.\n- If it was cracked while blackened, the compensation was twelve and a half dinars.\n- For any portion that broke off, the compensation was calculated proportionally from the twenty-five dinars.\nCollarbone (Tarquwah) Injuries\nRegarding the collarbone (tarquwah);\n- if it was broken and healed without any deformity or defect, the compensation was forty dinars.\n- If it was fractured, the compensation was four-fifths of the full compensation for its break, which is thirty-two dinars.\n- If there was a visible wound (mudihah) on it, the compensation was twenty-five dinars, which is five-eighths of its full compensation for a break.\n- If the bone was displaced, the compensation was half the blood money for its break, amounting to twenty dinars.\n- If it was deeply wounded (naqibah), the compensation was one-fourth of the blood money for its break, totaling ten dinars.\nShoulder (Mankib) Injuries\nThe compensation for a broken shoulder (mankib) was set at one-fifth of the blood money for the hand, amounting to one hundred dinars.\n- If there was a fracture (ṣadʿ) in the shoulder, the compensation was four-fifths of the compensation for its break, which is eighty dinars.\n- If there was a visible wound (muḍihah), the compensation was one-fourth of the compensation for its break, totaling twenty-five dinars.\n- If the bones were displaced, the compensation was one hundred seventy-five dinars, divided as follows: one hundred dinars for the break, fifty dinars for the displacement of the bones, and twenty-five dinars for the visible wound.\n- If there was a deep wound (naqibah), the compensation was one-fourth of the compensation for the break, which is twenty-five dinars.\n- If the shoulder was crushed, resulting in deformity, the compensation was one-third of the full blood money for life, amounting to three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\n- If it was merely loosened (fukk), the compensation was thirty dinars.\nUpper Arm (Adud) Injuries\nFor the upper arm (Adud);\n- if it was broken and healed without deformity or

    "englishText": "Hadith.5834 - The Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, said in his will to his son Muhammad ibn Al-Hanafiyyah, may Allah (swt) be pleased with him:\n\"O' my son, beware of relying on vain hopes, for they are the merchandise of the foolish and a hindrance from the Hereafter.\nOne of the best fortunes a person can have is a righteous companion - sit with the people of goodness, and you will be one of them; separate yourself from the people of evil.\nKeep away from those who divert you from the remembrance of Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, and the remembrance of death with embellished falsehoods and fabricated rumors.\nDo not let ill thoughts about Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, overpower you, for they will not leave any reconciliation between you and your friend.\nDiscipline your heart with good manners as fire is kindled with wood, for good manners are a great aid for one's nature, and experiences are a guide for the wise.\nCombine the opinions of different men, then choose the one closest to correctness and farthest from doubt.\nO' my son, there is no honor higher than Islam,\nno dignity greater than piety, n\no stronghold more secure than restraint,\nno intercessor more effective than repentance,\nno garment more beautiful than well-being,\nno protection stronger than safety,\nand no treasure wealthier than contentment.\nAnd there is no wealth that removes poverty better than contentment with sustenance.\nWhoever suffices with the bare necessities has attained ease and settled in comfort.\nGreed leads to plunging into sins.\nCast away intrusive worries with firm resolve in patience.\nAccustom yourself to patience, for it is the best of manners, and endure the hardships and concerns of this world.\nThe successful ones have triumphed, and those for whom Allah (swt) has decreed goodness have been saved, for patience is a shield against poverty.\nEntrust all your affairs to Allah (swt), the One (swt), the All-Dominant (swt), for in doing so, you take refuge in a fortified cave, a secure stronghold, and an invincible protector.\nSincerely direct your supplications to your Lord (swt), for in His (swt) hands are all good and evil, giving and withholding, granting and depriving.\"\nAnd Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as), said in this will:\n\"O' my son, sustenance is of two kinds: one that you seek, and one that seeks you. If you do not go to it, it will come to you. So do not burden yourself with the worries of your entire year upon the concern of your day; each day is sufficient with what it holds.\nIf the year is part of your life, then Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, will bring to you each day what He (swt) has apportioned for you.\nAnd if the year is not part of your life, then why concern yourself with grief and anxiety over what is not yours?\nKnow that no seeker can overtake you in your sustenance, nor can anyone overpower you in it, and what has been decreed for you will not be kept from you. How many seekers have you seen exhausting themselves, yet their provision remains restricted, while others who seek with moderation find that destiny aids them? And everything is accompanied by its end.\nToday is yours, but you have no certainty of reaching tomorrow. How many have awaited a day they never lived to see? How many were envied at the beginning of a night, yet by its end, they were mourned? So do not be deceived by the prolonged presence of blessings from Allah (swt) or by the delay in the arrival of punishment, for if He (swt) feared missing the opportunity, He (swt) would hasten the punishment before death.\nO' my son, accept the wisdom of the wise, reflect upon their judgments, and be the one who adheres most to what you command others and refrains most from what you forbid.\nEnjoin what is good so that you may be among its people, for the completion of matters lies with Allah (swt), Blessed and Exalted.\"\nEnjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and seek understanding in religion, for the jurists are the inheritors of the prophets. The prophets did not leave behind dinars or dirhams, but rather, they left behind knowledge, and whoever takes from it has taken a great share.\nKnow that the seeker of knowledge is prayed for by those in the heavens and the earth, even the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea. The angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of pleasure for him. In knowledge, there is the honor of this world and success in Paradise on the Day of Judgment, for the jurists are the callers to Paradise and the guides to Allah (swt), Blessed and Exalted.\nTreat all people kindly just as you would like to be treated, and be pleased for them with what you are pleased with for yourself.\nDislike for yourself what you dislike in others, and perfect your character with all people so that if you are absent, they long for you, and if you die, they weep for you and say, 'Indeed, we belong to Allah (swt), and indeed, to Him we shall return.'\"\nAnd do not be among those about whom it is said at their death: 'All praise is due to Allah (swt), the Lord of the worlds.' (being grateful of your demise)\nKnow that the essence of intellect, after faith in Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, is managing relationships with people. There is no good in one who does not deal kindly with those whom he must interact with, until Allah (swt) provides a way for deliverance from them. Indeed, I have found that everything by which people live and associate with one another fills a measure - two-thirds of it is appreciation, and one-third of it is overlooking faults.\nAllah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, has created nothing better than speech, and nothing more disgraceful than it. With speech, faces are brightened, and with speech, faces are blackened.\nKnow that speech remains under your control as long as you have not spoken it, but once you have spoken it, you become under its control. So guard your tongue as you would guard your gold and silver, for the tongue is a vicious dog - if you release it, it will bite. Many a word has stripped a person of blessings.\nWhoever lets go of his restraint is led to every undesirable and disgraceful act, and he will not be saved from his time except with the wrath of Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic and blame from people will follow the one who risks himself by relying solely on his own opinion.\nWhoever considers multiple perspectives will recognize where mistakes lie.\nWhoever rushes into matters without looking at the consequences exposes himself to devastating calamities.\nPlanning before action protects you from regret.\nThe intelligent one is he who learns from experiences, for in experiences lies new knowledge, and in the changes of circumstances lies the knowledge of the true nature of men.\nThe passing of days reveals hidden secrets.\nUnderstand this will of mine, and do not disregard it, for the best speech is that which benefits. Know, O' my son, that you must carefully seek provision and take only what is necessary while keeping your burden light. Do not load upon your back more than you can bear, lest it becomes a heavy burden upon you in your resurrection on the Day of Judgment.\nThe worst provision for the Hereafter is oppression against the servants of Allah (swt).\nKnow that ahead of you are dangers, pitfalls, bridges, and a steep ascent, which you will inevitably descend. Its descent will either lead to Paradise or to Hell. So prepare yourself before you reach it. If you find among those in need someone who can carry your provision to the Hereafter, so that he may deliver it to you when you are in dire need of it, then take advantage of this opportunity, and let him carry it for you while you have the ability. Perhaps a time will come when you seek such an opportunity but will not find it.\nBeware of entrusting your provisions to one who lacks piety and honesty, lest your condition be like that of a thirsty person who sees a mirage, but when he reaches it, he finds nothing, and so he remains stranded in the Hereafter with nothing to sustain him.\"\nAnd Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said in this will:\n\"O' my son, oppression leads to ruin.\nNo one will perish who knows his own worth.\nWhoever safeguards his desires preserves his dignity.\nThe worth of every person is in what they excel at.\nReflection brings guidance.\nThe noblest wealth is to abandon false hopes.\nGreed is present poverty.\nAffection is an acquired kinship.\nYour true friend is your brother from your father and mother, but not every sibling from your parents is your friend.\nDo not take the enemy of your friend as a friend, lest you become an enemy to your own friend.\nHow many distant people are closer to you than those who are near?\nA generous yet poor person is better than a wealthy but rude one.\nAdmonition is a refuge for those who heed it.\nWhoever boasts of his favor (to others) spoils it (their reward).\nWhoever has bad manners torments himself, and resentment is more fitting for him.\nIt is unjust to judge based on suspicion when trust is required.\nHow ugly is arrogance in victory, despair in hardship, cruelty to a neighbor, betrayal of a companion, breaking an oath by a noble person, and treachery from a ruler.\nDenying blessings leads to destruction, and keeping company with a fool is misfortune.\nAcknowledge the right of those who uphold it, whether they are noble or lowly.\nWhoever abandons moderation goes astray.\nWhoever oversteps justice finds his path narrow. How many ailing people have survived, and how many healthy ones have perished? Sometimes despair leads to success, and greed leads to destruction.\nReconcile with those whom you hope will accept your apology.\nNever sleep with betrayal in your heart toward anyone, for betrayal is the worst trait of a Muslim.\nWhoever betrays is likely to never be trusted again.\nCorruption ruins abundance, while moderation increases little.\nOf nobility is fulfilling covenants.\nWhoever is generous will lead, and whoever seeks understanding will increase in wisdom.\nBe sincere in advising your brother and support him in all matters, as long as he does not lead you into disobedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic.\"\nStay with your brother wherever he goes. Do not sever ties with him over doubt, nor cut him off without first seeking reconciliation - perhaps he has an excuse while you blame him.\nAccept the apology of one who seeks pardon, so that intercession may reach you.\nHonor those through whom you gain strength, and lengthen your companionship with them in kindness, respect, reverence, and esteem.\nThe recompense of one who elevates your status is not that you lower his, and the reward of one who brings you joy is not that you cause him sorrow.\nShow as much kindness as you can to your companion, for when you wish, you will find his guidance.\nThe faults of one clothed in modesty remain hidden from sight.\nWhoever maintains moderation finds his burdens lightened. Whoever does not grant his soul its desires attains wisdom.\nWith every hardship, there is ease, and with every meal, there may be choking. No blessing is attained except after hardship.\nBe gentle with one who angers you, and you will achieve your goal.\nThe hours of distress are hours of atonement, and time gradually consumes your life.\nThere is no good in a pleasure that is followed by the Fire. And no good is truly good if it is followed by the Fire, and no evil is truly evil if it is followed by Paradise.\nEvery pleasure besides Paradise is insignificant, and every hardship besides the Fire is a form of well-being.\nDo not neglect your brother's right, relying on the bond between you and him, for he is not truly your brother if you disregard his right.\nDo not let your brother be stronger in cutting ties with you than you are in maintaining them, nor let him be more capable of harming you than you are of showing kindness to him.\nO' my son, when you are strong, then be strong in obedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, and when you are weak, then let your weakness be in avoiding disobedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic.\nIf you can, do not grant a woman authority over her affairs beyond herself, for that preserves her beauty longer, brings her more peace of mind, and improves her condition.\nA woman is like a delicate flower, not a steward - so treat her kindly in every situation, and be good in your companionship with her so that your life may be peaceful.\nAccept fate with contentment.\nIf you wish to gather the best of this world and the Hereafter, then cut your expectations from what is in the hands of people.\nAnd peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah (swt), and His (swt) blessings.\"",

    "thaqalaynMatn": "\"O' my son, beware of relying on vain hopes, for they are the merchandise of the foolish and a hindrance from the Hereafter.\nOne of the best fortunes a person can have is a righteous companion - sit with the people of goodness, and you will be one of them; separate yourself from the people of evil.\nKeep away from those who divert you from the remembrance of Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, and the remembrance of death with embellished falsehoods and fabricated rumors.\nDo not let ill thoughts about Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, overpower you, for they will not leave any reconciliation between you and your friend.\nDiscipline your heart with good manners as fire is kindled with wood, for good manners are a great aid for one's nature, and experiences are a guide for the wise.\nCombine the opinions of different men, then choose the one closest to correctness and farthest from doubt.\nO' my son, there is no honor higher than Islam,\nno dignity greater than piety, n\no stronghold more secure than restraint,\nno intercessor more effective than repentance,\nno garment more beautiful than well-being,\nno protection stronger than safety,\nand no treasure wealthier than contentment.\nAnd there is no wealth that removes poverty better than contentment with sustenance.\nWhoever suffices with the bare necessities has attained ease and settled in comfort.\nGreed leads to plunging into sins.\nCast away intrusive worries with firm resolve in patience.\nAccustom yourself to patience, for it is the best of manners, and endure the hardships and concerns of this world.\nThe successful ones have triumphed, and those for whom Allah (swt) has decreed goodness have been saved, for patience is a shield against poverty.\nEntrust all your affairs to Allah (swt), the One (swt), the All-Dominant (swt), for in doing so, you take refuge in a fortified cave, a secure stronghold, and an invincible protector.\nSincerely direct your supplications to your Lord (swt), for in His (swt) hands are all good and evil, giving and withholding, granting and depriving.\"\nAnd Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as), said in this will:\n\"O' my son, sustenance is of two kinds: one that you seek, and one that seeks you. If you do not go to it, it will come to you. So do not burden yourself with the worries of your entire year upon the concern of your day; each day is sufficient with what it holds.\nIf the year is part of your life, then Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, will bring to you each day what He (swt) has apportioned for you.\nAnd if the year is not part of your life, then why concern yourself with grief and anxiety over what is not yours?\nKnow that no seeker can overtake you in your sustenance, nor can anyone overpower you in it, and what has been decreed for you will not be kept from you. How many seekers have you seen exhausting themselves, yet their provision remains restricted, while others who seek with moderation find that destiny aids them? And everything is accompanied by its end.\nToday is yours, but you have no certainty of reaching tomorrow. How many have awaited a day they never lived to see? How many were envied at the beginning of a night, yet by its end, they were mourned? So do not be deceived by the prolonged presence of blessings from Allah (swt) or by the delay in the arrival of punishment, for if He (swt) feared missing the opportunity, He (swt) would hasten the punishment before death.\nO' my son, accept the wisdom of the wise, reflect upon their judgments, and be the one who adheres most to what you command others and refrains most from what you forbid.\nEnjoin what is good so that you may be among its people, for the completion of matters lies with Allah (swt), Blessed and Exalted.\"\nEnjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and seek understanding in religion, for the jurists are the inheritors of the prophets. The prophets did not leave behind dinars or dirhams, but rather, they left behind knowledge, and whoever takes from it has taken a great share.\nKnow that the seeker of knowledge is prayed for by those in the heavens and the earth, even the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea. The angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of pleasure for him. In knowledge, there is the honor of this world and success in Paradise on the Day of Judgment, for the jurists are the callers to Paradise and the guides to Allah (swt), Blessed and Exalted.\nTreat all people kindly just as you would like to be treated, and be pleased for them with what you are pleased with for yourself.\nDislike for yourself what you dislike in others, and perfect your character with all people so that if you are absent, they long for you, and if you die, they weep for you and say, 'Indeed, we belong to Allah (swt), and indeed, to Him we shall return.'\"\nAnd do not be among those about whom it is said at their death: 'All praise is due to Allah (swt), the Lord of the worlds.' (being grateful of your demise)\nKnow that the essence of intellect, after faith in Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, is managing relationships with people. There is no good in one who does not deal kindly with those whom he must interact with, until Allah (swt) provides a way for deliverance from them. Indeed, I have found that everything by which people live and associate with one another fills a measure - two-thirds of it is appreciation, and one-third of it is overlooking faults.\nAllah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, has created nothing better than speech, and nothing more disgraceful than it. With speech, faces are brightened, and with speech, faces are blackened.\nKnow that speech remains under your control as long as you have not spoken it, but once you have spoken it, you become under its control. So guard your tongue as you would guard your gold and silver, for the tongue is a vicious dog - if you release it, it will bite. Many a word has stripped a person of blessings.\nWhoever lets go of his restraint is led to every undesirable and disgraceful act, and he will not be saved from his time except with the wrath of Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic and blame from people will follow the one who risks himself by relying solely on his own opinion.\nWhoever considers multiple perspectives will recognize where mistakes lie.\nWhoever rushes into matters without looking at the consequences exposes himself to devastating calamities.\nPlanning before action protects you from regret.\nThe intelligent one is he who learns from experiences, for in experiences lies new knowledge, and in the changes of circumstances lies the knowledge of the true nature of men.\nThe passing of days reveals hidden secrets.\nUnderstand this will of mine, and do not disregard it, for the best speech is that which benefits. Know, O' my son, that you must carefully seek provision and take only what is necessary while keeping your burden light. Do not load upon your back more than you can bear, lest it becomes a heavy burden upon you in your resurrection on the Day of Judgment.\nThe worst provision for the Hereafter is oppression against the servants of Allah (swt).\nKnow that ahead of you are dangers, pitfalls, bridges, and a steep ascent, which you will inevitably descend. Its descent will either lead to Paradise or to Hell. So prepare yourself before you reach it. If you find among those in need someone who can carry your provision to the Hereafter, so that he may deliver it to you when you are in dire need of it, then take advantage of this opportunity, and let him carry it for you while you have the ability. Perhaps a time will come when you seek such an opportunity but will not find it.\nBeware of entrusting your provisions to one who lacks piety and honesty, lest your condition be like that of a thirsty person who sees a mirage, but when he reaches it, he finds nothing, and so he remains stranded in the Hereafter with nothing to sustain him.\"\nAnd Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said in this will:\n\"O' my son, oppression leads to ruin.\nNo one will perish who knows his own worth.\nWhoever safeguards his desires preserves his dignity.\nThe worth of every person is in what they excel at.\nReflection brings guidance.\nThe noblest wealth is to abandon false hopes.\nGreed is present poverty.\nAffection is an acquired kinship.\nYour true friend is your brother from your father and mother, but not every sibling from your parents is your friend.\nDo not take the enemy of your friend as a friend, lest you become an enemy to your own friend.\nHow many distant people are closer to you than those who are near?\nA generous yet poor person is better than a wealthy but rude one.\nAdmonition is a refuge for those who heed it.\nWhoever boasts of his favor (to others) spoils it (their reward).\nWhoever has bad manners torments himself, and resentment is more fitting for him.\nIt is unjust to judge based on suspicion when trust is required.\nHow ugly is arrogance in victory, despair in hardship, cruelty to a neighbor, betrayal of a companion, breaking an oath by a noble person, and treachery from a ruler.\nDenying blessings leads to destruction, and keeping company with a fool is misfortune.\nAcknowledge the right of those who uphold it, whether they are noble or lowly.\nWhoever abandons moderation goes astray.\nWhoever oversteps justice finds his path narrow. How many ailing people have survived, and how many healthy ones have perished? Sometimes despair leads to success, and greed leads to destruction.\nReconcile with those whom you hope will accept your apology.\nNever sleep with betrayal in your heart toward anyone, for betrayal is the worst trait of a Muslim.\nWhoever betrays is likely to never be trusted again.\nCorruption ruins abundance, while moderation increases little.\nOf nobility is fulfilling covenants.\nWhoever is generous will lead, and whoever seeks understanding will increase in wisdom.\nBe sincere in advising your brother and support him in all matters, as long as he does not lead you into disobedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic.\"\nStay with your brother wherever he goes. Do not sever ties with him over doubt, nor cut him off without first seeking reconciliation - perhaps he has an excuse while you blame him.\nAccept the apology of one who seeks pardon, so that intercession may reach you.\nHonor those through whom you gain strength, and lengthen your companionship with them in kindness, respect, reverence, and esteem.\nThe recompense of one who elevates your status is not that you lower his, and the reward of one who brings you joy is not that you cause him sorrow.\nShow as much kindness as you can to your companion, for when you wish, you will find his guidance.\nThe faults of one clothed in modesty remain hidden from sight.\nWhoever maintains moderation finds his burdens lightened. Whoever does not grant his soul its desires attains wisdom.\nWith every hardship, there is ease, and with every meal, there may be choking. No blessing is attained except after hardship.\nBe gentle with one who angers you, and you will achieve your goal.\nThe hours of distress are hours of atonement, and time gradually consumes your life.\nThere is no good in a pleasure that is followed by the Fire. And no good is truly good if it is followed by the Fire, and no evil is truly evil if it is followed by Paradise.\nEvery pleasure besides Paradise is insignificant, and every hardship besides the Fire is a form of well-being.\nDo not neglect your brother's right, relying on the bond between you and him, for he is not truly your brother if you disregard his right.\nDo not let your brother be stronger in cutting ties with you than you are in maintaining them, nor let him be more capable of harming you than you are of showing kindness to him.\nO' my son, when you are strong, then be strong in obedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, and when you are weak, then let your weakness be in avoiding disobedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic.\nIf you can, do not grant a woman authority over her affairs beyond herself, for that preserves her beauty longer, brings her more peace of mind, and improves her condition.\nA woman is like a delicate flower, not a steward - so treat her kindly in every situation, and be good in your companionship with her so that your life may be peaceful.\nAccept fate with contentment.\nIf you wish to gather the best of this world and the Hereafter, then cut your expectations from what is in the hands of people.\nAnd peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah (swt), and His (swt) blessings.\"",

    "englishText": "Muhammad b. al-Hasan b. Ahmad b. al-Walid narrated to me. He said: Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-Saffar narrated to me. He said: `Ali b. Hassan al-Wasiti narrated to us from his uncle `Abd al-Rahman b. Kathir al-Hashimi from Ja`far b. Muhammad from his father (as). He said: A man from the companions of Amir al-Mu’minin (as) called Hammam, who was a worshiper, stood up and said: O Amir al-Mu’minin! Describe the Godfearing ones to me in such a way that it is as though I am looking at them. So, Amir al-Mu’minin (as) did not reply. Then, he said to him: Woe to you, Hammam, fear Allah and beautify, for Allah is with the Godfearing who beautify. So, Hammam said: O Amir al-Mu’minin! I ask you by Him who honoured you with that which He distinguished you with, and preferred you with what He gave you, and granted you with what you describe to me. So, Amir al-Mu’minin (as) stood on his feet, praised Allah and commended Him, blessed the Prophet and his Family, then said: As for that which comes after: Surely, Allah created the creation, and He was needless of their obedience and safe from their disobedience; for the disobedience of one who disobeys Him does not harm Him, and the obedience of one who obeys Him does not benefit Him. He apportioned their livelihood between them and placed them in their position in the world. Surely, Allah only caused Adam and Hawwa’ (as) to fall from Paradise as a punishment for what they had done when He prohibited them [from the fruit] and they defied Him; when He commanded them and they disobeyed Him. The pious therein (in the world) are of the people of virtue – their logic is sound, their apparel is prudence, and their sojourn is humility. They humble themselves before Allah through obedience, and they empty themselves [of this world]. They lower their gaze from that which Allah forbade them from. Their ears are set upon knowledge. They remedy their souls in calamity just as they remedy their souls in tranquility. They are content with the predestination of Allah. Had it not been for the time that Allah has ordained for them, their souls would not remain in their bodies for [the duration of] a twinkling of the eye out of desire for reward and fear of punishment. The greatness of the Creator is in their souls, and everything else is insignificant in their eyes. It is as though they could see Paradise and are reclining in it. It is as though they could see the Fire and are suffering in it. Their hearts are in grief, their evil is harmless, their bodies are thin, their needs are trivial, their souls are pure, and their restraint from this world is great. They are patient for a short number of days, followed by [a] long [period of] rest – [it is a] good trade that the Generous Lord eased for them. This world wanted them, but they did not want it; it sought them, but they escaped it.  At night, they line up their legs and recite and hymn sections (ajza’) of the Quran. With it, they bring grief to their souls, and they use it to treat their ailments, the agitation of their grief, their weeping over their sins, and the pain of their wounds. When they come across a verse that frightens, they attend to it with their hearts and their sights. Their skin shudders from it, their hearts tremble from it, and they feel as though the roar, exhalation, and inhalation of Hell is in their ears. When they come across a verse that gives glad tidings, they incline toward it with hope, their souls [almost] leave [their body] out of desire for it, and they feel as though it is before their eyes. They kneel, glorifying the Great and Powerful God, [prostrating with] their foreheads, hands, knees, and the tips of their feet. Their tears flow down their cheeks, pleading to Allah that He unfastens their necks. In the day, they are wise, scholarly, righteous, and pious. Fear has made them thin like arrows. When one looks at them, he will think that they are ill, even though they are not ill; or he will say: “they are bewildered”, and [yes,] they are bewildered by a great matter. When they think about the greatness of Allah and the intensity of His power along with their bewilderment at the thought of death and the horrors of the Resurrection, their hearts panic. So, their thoughts become overwhelmed and their minds become astounded. When they awake, they hasten to Allah with pure deeds. They are not satisfied with doing few deeds for Allah, and they do not regard their many deeds as great. They cast blame on their own selves, and they pity their own deeds. If one of them is praised [by the people], he fears what they say, and he repents to Allah for what they do not know about, and he says: “I know more about myself than others, and Allah knows more about me than myself. O Allah! Do not hold me account to what they say, make me better than what they think, and forgive me of that which they do not know about me, for You are the Knower of the Unseen and the Concealer of Flaws.” One of their signs is that you will see that they have strength in religion, determination with leniency, faith with certainty, protectiveness over knowledge, the comprehension of understanding, knowledge with forbearance, favourable in good times, sorrowful in loss, moderate when they are wealthy, humble in worship, elegant in poverty, patient in tough times, graceful in effort, giving in the rights [of others], friendly in good times, seeking the permissible, lively in guidance, ashamed of greediness, healed by uprightness, and neglectful of desires. He is not deceived by the compliments of those ignorant of him, and he does not stop counting his deeds. He takes his time in his deeds, and he does righteous deeds whilst he is fearful. When he sleeps, his concern is gratitude, and when he awakes, he busies himself with the remembrance [of Allah]. He sleeps with caution lest he becomes heedless, and he becomes happy when he receives bounties and grace. When his soul burdens him, he does not give it that which ails it. His happiness is in the Immortal and the Everlasting. The joy of his eye is in Him who does not recede. His desire is in Him who remains. He is ascetic to that which is fleeting. He intertwines knowledge with forbearance, and he intertwines forbearance with intellect. You find him far removed from laziness, for he is always active. He inclines toward hope. He makes few slips. He is expectant of his death. He humbles his heart. He remembers his Lord. He fears his sin. He is content in his soul. His ignorance is absent. His demeanor is easygoing. He is protective of his religion. His lust is deadened. He withholds his wrath. His character is serene. His neighbours are safe from him. His arrogance is feeble. His patience is strong. His remembrance [of his Lord] is much. He is orderly. He does not speak about that which his friends have entrusted him with, and he does not hide what he sees of the enemy. He does not do the right thing to flaunt. Modesty never leaves him. Goodness is expected from him, and [people consider themselves] safe from his evil. When he is heedless, he is considered among those who remember; and when he is considered among those who remember, he will not be considered heedless. He forgives those who wrong him, he gives to those who deprive him, and he connects to those who cut him off. He does not cease in his forbearance. He does not come down on those who doubt him, and he pardons them once they see him [properly]. His ignorance is far removed. His speech is tender. His plotting is absent. His established virtues are imminent. His speech is honest. His actions are beautiful. His goodness is accepted [by Allah]. He has turned away from evil. In earthquakes, he is solemn. In bad times, he is patient. In relaxation, he is thankful. He does not treat one that he hates unfairly. He does not harm one that he loves. He does not claim what does not belong to him. He does not deny a right that he must give [to others]. He confesses to the truth before witnesses testify against him. He does not lose what he is entrusted with. He does not call people by hateful nicknames. He does not betray anyone. He does not concern himself with envy. He does not harm the neighbour. He does not gloat over misfortunes. He is quick to reason. He fulfills trusts. He avoids evil. He enjoins in the established virtues and prohibits evil. He does not enter matters ignorantly, and he does not depart from the truth out of weakness. When he is silent, silence does not overwhelm him, and when he speaks, he does not speak wrongly. When he laughs, his voice is not heard. He is content with what has been apportioned for him. Anger does not build up in him, nor is he overcome by desire. He is not overwhelmed by scarcity, nor does he covet that which is not his. He mixes with the people so that he may learn. He is silent so that he may be peaceable. He asks so that he may understand. He seeks so that he may learn. He does not harken to goodness to seek pride from it, nor does he speak of it to coerce others to behave like him. When he is betrayed, he is patient, so that Allah may be the one to seek vengeance for him. He troubles over himself, while the people are at rest because of him. He tires himself for the Hereafter, while the people are at rest because of him. His keeping away from those who distance themselves from him is asceticism and purification. His nearness to those who draw near to him is lenience and grace. Thus, his distancing is not out of arrogance or haughtiness, nor is his nearness out of trickery or manipulation. Rather, he behaves like the people of goodness before him, and thusly, he becomes an example for the people of righteousness after him. He said: So, Hammam swooned to the point where his soul passed with it. So, Amir al-Mu’minin (as) said: By Allah, I feared that this may happen to him. So, he called for his [funeral] preparation and prayed over him. Then, he said: This is what goodly exhortations do when they reach their rightful audience. So, a person said: Why hasn’t this happened to you, Amir al-Mu’minin? So, he said: Woe to you! For every person is an apportioned time that cannot be surpassed and a cause that cannot be exceeded. So, be at ease, and do not repeat this, for Satan has placed this saying upon your tongue.",
    "arabicText": "897 / 2 - حدثني محمد بن الحسن بن أحمد بن الوليد، قال: حدثني محمد  ابن الحسن الصفار، قال: حدثنا علي بن حسان الواسطي، عن عمه عبد الرحمن بن كثير الهاشمي، عن جعفر بن محمد، عن أبيه (عليه السلام)، قال: قام رجل من أصحاب أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) يقال له همام وكان عابدا، فقال له: يا أمير المؤمنين، صف لي المتقين حتى كأني أنظر إليهم، فتثاقل أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) عن جوابه، ثم قال له: ويحك يا همام، اتق الله، وأحسن، فإن الله مع الذي اتقوا والذين هم محسنون. فقال همام: يا أمير المؤمنين، أسألك بالذي أكرمك بما خصك به وحباك وفضلك بما آتاك وأعطاك لما وصفتهم لي. فقام أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) قائما على قدميه (1) فحمد الله وأثنى عليه، وصلى على النبي وآله، ثم قال: أما بعد، فإن الله عزوجل خلق الخلق حيث خلقهم غنيا عن طاعتهم، آمنا لمعصيتهم، لانه لا تضره معصية من عصاه منهم، ولا تنفعه طاعة من أطاعه منهم، وقسم بينهم معايشهم، ووضعهم من (2) الدنيا مواضعهم، وإنما أهبط الله آدم وحواء (عليهما السلام) من الجنة عقوبة لما صنعا، حيث نهاهما فخالفاه، وأمرهما فعصياه. فالمتقون فيها من أهل الفضائل، منطقهم الصواب، وملبسهم الاقتصاد، ومشيهم التواضع. خشعوا (3) لله عزوجل بالطاعة فتهبوا (4)، فهم غاضون أبصارهم عما حرم الله عليهم، واقفين أسماعهم على العلم، نزلت أنفسهم منهم في البلاء كالتي  نزلت منهم الرخاء، رضا منهم عن الله بالقضاء، ولولا الآجال التي كتب الله (1) عليهم لم تستقر أرواحهم في أجسادهم طرفة عين، شوقا إلى الثواب، وخوفا من العقاب. عظم الخالق في أنفسهم، ووضع (2) ما دونه في أعينهم، فهم والجنة كمن رآها، فهم فيها متكئون، وهم والنار كمن رآها، فهم فيها معذبون، قلوبهم محزونة، وشرورهم مأمونة، وأجسادهم نحيفة، وحوائجهم خفيفة، وأنفسهم عفيفة، ومؤنتهم من الدنيا عظيمة، صبروا أياما قصارا أعقبتهم راحة طويلة، تجارة مربحة يسرها لهم رب كريم، أرادتهم الدنيا فلم يريدوها، وطلبتهم فأعجزوها. أما الليل فصافون أقدامهم، تالين لاجزاء القرآن، يرتلونه ترتيلا، يحزنون به أنفسهم، ويستثيرون به دواء دائهم ويهيج أحزانهم، بكاء على ذنوبهم ووجع كلوم جراحهم، فإذا مروا بآية فيها تخويف، أصغوا إليها مسامع قلوبهم وأبصارهم، فاقشعرت منها جلودهم، ووجلت منها قلوبهم، فظنوا أن صهيل جهنم وزفيرها وشهيقها في أصول آذانهم، وإذا مروا بآية فيها تشويق ركنوا إليها طمعا، وتطلعت انفسهم إليها شوقا، وظنوا أنها نصب أعينهم، جاثين على أوساطهم، يمجدون جبارا عظيما، مفترشين جباههم وأكفهم وركبهم وأطراف أقدامهم، تجري دموعهم على خدودهم، يجأرون إلى الله في فكاك رقابهم. أما النهار فحلماء علماء بررة أتقيا، قد براهم الخوف، فهم أمثال القداح، ينظر إليهم الناظر فيحسبهم مرضى وما بالقوم من مرض، أو يقول: قد خولطوا فقد خالط القوم أمر عظيم، إذا فكروا في عظمة الله وشدة سلطانه مع ما يخالطهم من ذكر الموت وأهوال القيامة، فزع ذلك قلوبهم، فطاشت حلومهم، وذهلت عقولهم، فإذا استفاقوا بادروا إلى الله عزوجل بالاعمال الزكية.  لا يرضون لله بالقليل، ولا يستكثرون له الجزيل، فهم لانفسهم متهمون، ومن أعمالهم مشفقون، إن زكي أحدهم خاف مما يقولون، ويستغفر الله مما لا يعلمون، وقال: أنا أعلم بنفسي من غيري، وربي أعلم مني بنفسي (1)، اللهم لا تؤاخذني بما يقولون، و اجعلني خيرا مما يظنون، واغفر لي مالا يعلمون، فإنك علام الغيوب، وساتر العيوب. ومن علامة أحدهم أنك ترى له قوة في دين، وحزما في لين، وإيمانا في يقين، وحرصا على العلم، وفهما في فقه، وعلما في حلم، وكسبا في رفق، وشفقة في نفقة، وقصدا في غنى، وخشوعا في عبادة، وتجملا في فاقة، وصبرا في شدة، و رحمة للمجهود، وإعطاه في حق، ورفقا في كسب، وطلبا للحلال، ونشاطا في الهدى، وتحرجا عن الطمع، وبرأ في استقامة، وإغماضا عند شهوة. لا يغره ثناء من جهله، ولا يدع إحصاء عمله (2)، مستبطئا لنفسه في العمل، ويعمل الاعمال الصالحة وهو على وجل، يمسي وهمه الشكر، ويصبح وشغله الذكر، يبيت حذرا لما حذر من الغفلة، فرحا لما أصاب من الفضل والرحمة، إن استصعب عليه نفسه لم يعطها سؤلها فيما فيه مضرته، ففرحه فيما يخلد ويدوم، وقرة عينه فيما لا يزول، ورغبة فيما يبقى، وزهادته فيما يفنى، يمرج العلم بالحم، ويمزج الحلم بالعقل. تراه بعيد كسله، دائما نشاطه، قريبا أمله، قليلا زلوله، متوقعا أجله، خاشعا قلبه، ذاكرا ربه، خائفا ذنبه، قانعة نفسه، متغيبا جهله، سهلا أمره، حريزا لدينه، ميتة شهوته، كاظما غيظه، صافيا خلقه، آمنا منه جاره، ضعيفا كبره، متينا صبره، كثيرا ذكره، محكما أمره. لا يحدث بما يؤتمن عليه الاصدقاء ولا يكتم شهادته الاعداء، ولا يعمل شيئا  من الحق، رياء، ولا يتركه حياء الخير منه مأمول، والشر منه مأمون، إن كان من الغافلين كتب من الذاكرين، وإن كان من الذاكرين لم يكتب من الغافلين. يعفو عمن ظلمه، ويعطي من حرمه، ويصل من قطعه، ولا يعزب حلمه، ولا يعجل فيما يريبه، ويصفح عما قد تبين له، بعيدا جهله، لينا قوله، غائبا مكره، قريبا معروفه، صادقا قوله، حسنا فعله، مقبلا خيره، مدبرا شره، فهو في الزلازل وقور، وفي المكاره صبور، وفي الرخاء شكور، لا يحيف على من يبغض، ولا يأثم فيمن يحب، ولا يدعي ما ليس له، ولا يجحد حقا هو عليه، يعترف بالحق قبل أن يشهد عليه، لا يضيع ما استحفظ، ولا يتنابز بالالقاب، لا يبغي على أحد، ولا يهم بالحسد، ولا يضر بالجار، ولا يشمت بالمصائب، سريع إلى الصواب، مؤد للامانات، بطئ عن المنكرات. يأمر بالمعروف، وينهى عن المنكر، لا يدخل في الامور بجهل، ولا يخرج عن الحق بعجز، إن صمت لم يغمه الصمت، وإن نطق لم يقل خطأ، وإن ضحك لم يعد صوته سمعه، قانعا بالذي قدر له، لا يجمع به الغيظ، ولا يغلبه الهوى، ولا يقهره الشح، ولا يطمع فيما ليس له، يخالط الناس ليعلم، ويصمت ليسلم، ويسأل ليفهم، ويبحث ليعلم، لا ينصت للخير ليفخر به، ولا يتكلم به ليتجبر على من سواه، إن بغي عليه صبر حتى يكون الله [ هو ] (1) الذي ينتقم له. نفسه منه في عناء والناس منه في راحة، أتعب نفسه لآخرة، وأراح الناس من نفسه، بعده ممن تباعد عنه زهد ونزاهة، ودونه ممن دنا منه لين ورحمة، فليس تباعده بكبر ولا عظمة، ولا دنوه لخديعة ولا خلابة (2)، بل يقتدي بمن كان قبله من أهل الخير، فهو إمام لمن خلفه من أهل البر. قال: فصعق همام صعقة كانت نفسه فيها، فقال أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام): أما والله لقد كنت أخافها عليه. وأمر به فجهز وصلى عليه، وقال: هكذا تصنع المواعظ  البالغة بأهلها. فقال قائل: فما بالك أنت يا أمير المؤمنين؟ فقال: ويلك! إن لكل أجلا لن يعدوه، وسببا لا يجاوزه، فمهلا لا تعد، فإنه إنما نفث هذا القول على لسانك الشيطان (1).",

This world wanted them, but they did not want it; it sought them, but they escaped it.  At night, they line up their legs and recite and hymn sections (ajza’) of the Quran. With it, they bring grief to their souls, and they use it to treat their ailments, the agitation of their grief, their weeping over their sins, and the pain of their wounds. When they come across a verse that frightens, they attend to it with their hearts and their sights. Their skin shudders from it, their hearts tremble from it, and they feel as though the roar, exhalation, and inhalation of Hell is in their ears. When they come across a verse that gives glad tidings, they incline toward it with hope, their souls [almost] leave [their body] out of desire for it, and they feel as though it is before their eyes. They kneel, glorifying the Great and Powerful God, [prostrating with] their foreheads, hands, knees, and the tips of their feet. Their tears flow down their cheeks, pleading to Allah that He unfastens their necks. In the day, they are wise, scholarly, righteous, and pious. Fear has made them thin like arrows. When one looks at them, he will think that they are ill, even though they are not ill; or he will say: “they are bewildered”, and [yes,] they are bewildered by a great matter. When they think about the greatness of Allah and the intensity of His power along with their bewilderment at the thought of death and the horrors of the Resurrection, their hearts panic. So, their thoughts become overwhelmed and their minds become astounded. When they awake, they hasten to Allah with pure deeds. They are not satisfied with doing few deeds for Allah, and they do not regard their many deeds as great. They cast blame on their own selves, and they pity their own deeds. If one of them is praised [by the people], he fears what they say, and he repents to Allah for what they do not know about, and he says: “I know more about myself than others, and Allah knows more about me than myself. O Allah! Do not hold me account to what they say, make me better than what they think, and forgive me of that which they do not know about me, for You are the Knower of the Unseen and the Concealer of Flaws.” One of their signs is that you will see that they have strength in religion, determination with leniency, faith with certainty, protectiveness over knowledge, the comprehension of understanding, knowledge with forbearance, favourable in good times, sorrowful in loss, moderate when they are wealthy, humble in worship, elegant in poverty, patient in tough times, graceful in effort, giving in the rights [of others], friendly in good times, seeking the permissible, lively in guidance, ashamed of greediness, healed by uprightness, and neglectful of desires. He is not deceived by the compliments of those ignorant of him, and he does not stop counting his deeds. He takes his time in his deeds, and he does righteous deeds whilst he is fearful. When he sleeps, his concern is gratitude, and when he awakes, he busies himself with the remembrance [of Allah]. He sleeps with caution lest he becomes heedless, and he becomes happy when he receives bounties and grace. When his soul burdens him, he does not give it that which ails it. His happiness is in the Immortal and the Everlasting. The joy of his eye is in Him who does not recede. His desire is in Him who remains. He is ascetic to that which is fleeting. He intertwines knowledge with forbearance, and he intertwines forbearance with intellect. You find him far removed from laziness, for he is always active. He inclines toward hope. He makes few slips. He is expectant of his death. He humbles his heart. He remembers his Lord. He fears his sin. He is content in his soul. His ignorance is absent. His demeanor is easygoing. He is protective of his religion. His lust is deadened. He withholds his wrath. His character is serene. His neighbours are safe from him. His arrogance is feeble. His patience is strong. His remembrance [of his Lord] is much. He is orderly. He does not speak about that which his friends have entrusted him with, and he does not hide what he sees of the enemy. He does not do the right thing to flaunt. Modesty never leaves him. Goodness is expected from him, and [people consider themselves] safe from his evil. When he is heedless, he is considered among those who remember; and when he is considered among those who remember, he will not be considered heedless. He forgives those who wrong him, he gives to those who deprive him, and he connects to those who cut him off. He does not cease in his forbearance. He does not come down on those who doubt him, and he pardons them once they see him [properly]. His ignorance is far removed. His speech is tender. His plotting is absent. His established virtues are imminent. His speech is honest. His actions are beautiful. His goodness is accepted [by Allah]. He has turned away from evil. In earthquakes, he is solemn. In bad times, he is patient. In relaxation, he is thankful. He does not treat one that he hates unfairly. He does not harm one that he loves. He does not claim what does not belong to him. He does not deny a right that he must give [to others]. He confesses to the truth before witnesses testify against him. He does not lose what he is entrusted with. He does not call people by hateful nicknames. He does not betray anyone. He does not concern himself with envy. He does not harm the neighbour. He does not gloat over misfortunes. He is quick to reason. He fulfills trusts. He avoids evil. He enjoins in the established virtues and prohibits evil. He does not enter matters ignorantly, and he does not depart from the truth out of weakness. When he is silent, silence does not overwhelm him, and when he speaks, he does not speak wrongly. When he laughs, his voice is not heard. He is content with what has been apportioned for him. Anger does not build up in him, nor is he overcome by desire. He is not overwhelmed by scarcity, nor does he covet that which is not his. He mixes with the people so that he may learn. He is silent so that he may be peaceable. He asks so that he may understand. He seeks so that he may learn. He does not harken to goodness to seek pride from it, nor does he speak of it to coerce others to behave like him. When he is betrayed, he is patient, so that Allah may be the one to seek vengeance for him. He troubles over himself, while the people are at rest because of him. He tires himself for the Hereafter, while the people are at rest because of him. His keeping away from those who distance themselves from him is asceticism and purification. His nearness to those who draw near to him is lenience and grace. Thus, his distancing is not out of arrogance or haughtiness, nor is his nearness out of trickery or manipulation. Rather, he behaves like the people of goodness before him, and thusly, he becomes an example for the people of righteousness after him. He said: So, Hammam swooned to the point where his soul passed with it. So, Amir al-Mu’minin (as) said: By Allah, I feared that this may happen to him. So, he called for his [funeral] preparation and prayed over him. Then, he said: This is what goodly exhortations do when they reach their rightful audience. So, a person said: Why hasn’t this happened to you, Amir al-Mu’minin? So, he said: Woe to you! For every person is an apportioned time that cannot be surpassed and a cause that cannot be exceeded. So, be at ease, and do not repeat this, for Satan has placed this saying upon your tongue.",

    "englishText": "We would reply: There is no such choice, because a person who doubts the Imamate of Ibn Hasan, the discourse with him must be about the explicit narrations of his Imamate and one must provide him proofs of his Imamate. It is not rational to discuss with him the reason of his occultation while he doubts his very Imamate, because the inquiry of the offshoots is not sensible, but after the authentication of fundamentals. We gave preference to inquiry of his Imamate over the inquiry of his occultation and its wisdom, because his Imamate is based on intellectual matters that are beyond skepticism, whereas, the wisdom of occultation may seem obscure and confusing.",

    "englishText": "ZIYARAT JAMI'A FOR ALL THE IMAMS (as)\nHadith.3213 - It is narrated by Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Barmaki, who said: Musa ibn Abdullah al-Nakha'i narrated, \"I said to Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Imam Musa ibn Jafar Al-Kadhim ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib (as), 'Teach me, O son of the Messenger of Allah (swt), a complete and eloquent phrase to say when I visit any one of you.'\nImam (as) said:\n\"When you reach the entrance, stand and testify to the two testimonies of faith while in a state of ritual purity (ghusl). When you enter and see the grave, stand and say 'Allah (swt) is the Greatest, Allah (swt) is the Greatest' thirty times. Walk forward slowly with tranquility and dignity, keeping your steps close together. Then stand and say 'Allah (swt) is the Greatest' thirty times again. Approach the grave and say 'Allah (swt) is the Greatest' forty times, completing one hundred takbirs. Then say:\nPeace be upon you, O people of the House of Prophethood,\nand the abode of the Message,\nthe place of the angels' frequent visits,\nthe descent of revelation,\nthe source of mercy,\nthe treasures of knowledge,\nthe culmination of forbearance,\nthe foundation of generosity,\nthe leaders of nations,\nthe custodians of blessings,\nthe essence of righteousness,\nthe pillars of virtue,\nthe guides of servants,\nthe anchors of lands,\nthe gates of faith,\nthe trustees of the Most Merciful,\nthe progeny of the Prophets,\nthe chosen ones among the messengers,\nthe family of the best of the Lord (azj) of the Worlds.\nMay Allah’s (swt) mercy and blessings be upon you.\nPeace be upon the Imams of guidance,\nthe lamps in the darkness,\nthe standards of piety,\nthe possessors of wisdom,\nthe masters of intellect,\nthe refuge of humanity,\nthe inheritors of the Prophets,\nthe highest example,\nthe bearers of the best call,\nand the proofs of Allah (swt) for the inhabitants of the world,\nthe Hereafter, and this life.\nMay Allah’s (swt) mercy and blessings be upon you.\"\nPeace be upon the repositories of Allah’s (swt) knowledge,\nand the abodes of Allah’s (swt) blessings,\nand the mines of Allah’s (swt) wisdom,\nand the keepers of Allah’s (swt) secrets,\nand the bearers of Allah’s (swt) Book,\nand the successors of the Prophet of Allah (swt),\nand the progeny of the Messenger of Allah (swt), peace be upon him and his family.\nMay Allah’s (swt) mercy and blessings be upon you.\nPeace be upon the callers to Allah (swt),\nand the guides to Allah’s (swt) pleasure,\nand those who remain steadfast in Allah’s (swt) command,\nand those who are perfect in their love for Allah (swt),\nand those who are sincere in Allah’s (swt) oneness,\nand those who manifest Allah’s (swt) command and prohibition,\nand His honored servants,\n\"who do not precede Him in speech and act according to His command\"\n(May Allah’s (swt) mercy and blessings be upon them).\nPeace be upon the Imams who are callers (to the truth),\nthe leaders of guidance,\nthe noble masters,\nthe protectors and guardians,\nthe people of remembrance,\nthe possessors of authority,\nthe remnant of Allah (swt),\nHis chosen ones,\nHis party,\nthe repository of His knowledge,\nHis proof,\nHis path,\nand His light.\nMay Allah’s (swt) mercy and blessings be upon them.\nI bear witness that there is no god but Allah (swt), alone, without partner,\nas Allah (swt) has testified for Himself,\nand as His angels and those endowed with knowledge among His creation have testified,\n\"There is no god but Him, the Mighty, the Wise.\"\nAnd I bear witness that Muhammad is His chosen servant and His approved Messenger.\nHe sent him \"with guidance and the religion of truth to make it prevail over all religions, even if the polytheists detest it.\"\nAnd I bear witness that you are the rightly guided, rightly guiding Imams,\nthe infallible, the honored, the close to Allah (swt),\nthe pious, the truthful, the chosen,\nobedient to Allah (swt), steadfast in His command,\nacting according to His will, victorious by His grace.\nHe selected you by His knowledge,\napproved you for His unseen matters,\nchose you for His secrets,\nand preferred you by His power.\nHe honored you with His guidance,\ndistinguished you with His proof,\nelected you by His light,\nsupported you by His spirit,\nand was pleased with you as successors on His earth,\nproofs over His creation,\nhelpers of His religion,\nguardians of His secrets,\ntreasurers of His knowledge,\nrepositories of His wisdom,\ninterpreters of His revelation,\npillars of His oneness,\nwitnesses over His creation,\nguiding beacons for His servants,\na shining light in His lands,\nand guides to His path.\nAllah (swt) protected you from errors,\nsecured you from trials,\npurified you from impurity,\nremoved from you any defilement, O People of the House,\nand purified you thoroughly.\nYou have magnified His majesty,\nexalted His status,\nglorified His generosity,\npersisted in remembering Him,\naffirmed His covenant,\nperfected the bond of obedience to Him,\nadvised for Him in private and in public,\nand called to His path.\n\"With wisdom and good counsel,\" you dedicated yourselves to seeking His pleasure,\nyou patiently endured what befell you for His sake,\nyou established prayer, gave zakat, enjoined good, forbade evil,\nand strove \"in the way of Allah (swt) with true striving.\"\nYou proclaimed His call, clarified His obligations,\nupheld His limits, disseminated His laws,\nand revived His traditions. In all this, you sought His approval,\nsubmitted to His decree, and affirmed the truth of His previous messengers.\nThus, whoever deviates from you has gone astray,\nwhoever adheres to you has attained success,\nand whoever falls short in recognizing your rights has perished.\nThe truth is with you, among you, from you, and returns to you.\nYou are its people, its source, and its inheritors.\nThe legacy of prophethood rests with you,\nthe return of creation is toward you,\ntheir reckoning is upon you,\ndecisive judgment lies with you,\nthe signs of Allah (swt) are with you,\nand His resolutions are within you.\nHis light and His proofs are with you,\nand His command belongs to you.\nWhoever befriends you has befriended Allah (swt),\nwhoever opposes you has opposed Allah (swt),\nwhoever loves you has loved Allah (swt),\nand whoever hates you has hated Allah (swt).\nWhoever holds fast to you has clung to Allah (swt).\nYou are the straight path,\nwitnesses in the transient world,\nintercessors in the eternal abode,\nthe constant mercy,\nthe concealed sign,\nthe preserved trust,\nand the gate through which people are tested.\nWhoever comes to you is saved,\nand whoever does not come to you is doomed.\nYou invite to Allah (swt),\nguide toward Him,\nbelieve in Him,\nsubmit to Him,\nact according to His command,\nguide others to His path,\nand judge by His word.\nBlessed is the one who befriends you,\nruined is the one who opposes you,\ndisappointed is the one who denies you,\nmisguided is the one who separates from you,\nand triumphant is the one who clings to you.\nSecure is the one who seeks refuge in you,\nat peace is the one who believes in you,\nand guided is the one who holds on to you.\nWhoever follows you, Paradise is his abode,\nand whoever opposes you, Hell is his destination.\nWhoever denies you is a disbeliever,\nwhoever fights you is a polytheist,\nand whoever rejects you resides in the lowest depths of Hell.\nI bear witness that this (virtue and status) was ordained for you in the past and continues for you in the future. I testify that your souls, your light, and your essence are one, pure and purified, \"one part derived from the other.\"\nAllah (swt) created you as luminous lights, encircling His Throne until He blessed us through you. He placed you \"in houses Allah (swt) permitted to be exalted and His name remembered therein.\"\nHe made our prayers upon you and what He has blessed us with through your guardianship a source of purity for our creation, a cleansing for our souls, an atonement for our sins, and a means of purification for us.\nThus, in His presence, we are recognized for our acceptance of your excellence and our affirmation of your truth. Allah (swt) elevated you to the most exalted station of the honored ones, the highest ranks of the near ones, and the most elevated degrees of the messengers, where none can surpass you, none can precede you, and none can aspire to equal your rank.\nNo angel brought near, no prophet sent forth, no truthful one, no martyr, no scholar, no ignorant person, no lowly one, no virtuous one, no believing righteous person, no sinful wretched person, no oppressive tyrant, no rebellious devil, nor any creation in between bears witness except that they have been made to recognize the majesty of your station, the grandeur of your status, the greatness of your position, the completion of your light, the truth of your seats (in divine presence), the firmness of your standing, the nobility of your rank, your elevated status with Him, your honor before Him, and your nearness to Him.\nMay my father, my mother, my family, my wealth, and my lineage be sacrificed for you.\nI call Allah (swt) to witness, and I call you to witness, that I believe in you and in what you believe in, disbelieve in your enemies and in what they disbelieve in, and have clarity about your status and the misguidance of those who oppose you. I am loyal to you and your friends, and I bear enmity toward your enemies. I am at peace with those who are at peace with you and at war with those who are at war with you. I affirm what you affirm and reject what you reject.\nI obey you, acknowledge your right, admit your superiority, uphold your knowledge, seek protection under your covenant, recognize you, and believe in your return. I affirm your reappearance and await your command. I look forward to your governance, adhere to your word, act upon your instruction, seek refuge with you, and visit you. I seek sanctuary and protection at your graves and seek intercession with Allah (swt), the Exalted, through you. I draw near to Him by your means, and I present you before all my needs, wishes, and aspirations in all my circumstances and affairs.\nI believe in your hidden and manifest (realities), your presence and absence, your first and last. I entrust all matters to you, align myself with you, and my heart is in peace with you. My views follow yours, and my support is prepared for you until Allah (swt) revives His religion through you, returns you in His days (of divine rule), manifests you for His justice, and grants you authority on His earth.\nWith you, with you, not with your enemies! I believe in you and hold your last (Imam) in the same regard as your first, and I distance myself from your enemies and from al-Jibt and al-Taghut, the devils and their followers, the oppressors against you, those who reject your rights, those who deviate from your guardianship, usurpers of your inheritance, those who doubt you, those who turn away from you, and from every entity that substitutes for you, every leader who invites to the fire.\nMay Allah (swt) keep me steadfast throughout my life in your loyalty, love, and religion. May He grant me success in obeying you, provide me with your intercession, and make me among the best of your followers who adhere to what you call towards. May He make me among those who emulate your path, walk in your way, are guided by your guidance, and are gathered in your company. May He return me during your return, allow me to rule during your government, honor me in your well-being, empower me in your days, and let my eyes be delighted tomorrow by seeing you.\nMay my father, mother, self, family, and wealth be ransomed for you. Whoever seeks Allah (swt) begins with you; whoever declares His oneness accepts from you; whoever aims towards Him turns to you. My masters, I cannot count your praises, nor can I reach the depths of your commendation or the height of your description.\nYou are the light of the righteous, guides of the virtuous, and proofs of the Almighty. Through you, Allah (swt) opens and through you, He concludes. Through you, He sends down rain, and through you, He holds the sky from falling on the earth except by His permission.\nThrough you, Allah (swt) alleviates grief and removes hardships. With you rests what His messengers conveyed and what His angels descended with. To your grandfather, the Trustworthy Spirit (Jibreel) was sent, and if the visitation is for Amir al-Mu'minin (as), say: \"To your brother, the Trustworthy Spirit was sent.\" Allah (swt) granted you what He has not granted anyone from the worlds. Every noble being bows before your nobility, every arrogant soul submits to your obedience, every tyrant yields to your excellence, and everything is humbled before you. The earth is illuminated by your light, and the successful ones attain salvation through your guardianship.\nThrough you, the path to divine satisfaction is tread, while upon those who deny your guardianship is the wrath of the Most Merciful.\nMay my father, mother, self, family, and wealth be ransomed for you. Your mention is in the remembrance of those who remember, your names are among the finest of names, your bodies among the most honored of bodies, your souls among the most purified of souls, your selves among the noblest of selves, your legacy among the greatest of legacies, and your graves among the holiest of graves.\nHow sweet are your names, how noble your selves, how exalted your station, how magnificent your rank, how fulfilled your promise! Your words are light, your commands are guidance, your teachings are piety, your actions are goodness, your habit is benevolence, your nature is generosity, your conduct is truth and kindness. Your speech is wisdom and decisive, your judgment is knowledge, patience, and resolve.\nWhen goodness is mentioned, you are its beginning, its origin, its root, its essence, and its ultimate end.\nMay my father, mother, and self be sacrificed for you! How can I describe the beauty of your praise or count the favors you have bestowed? Through you, Allah (swt) removed us from humiliation, relieved us of overwhelming distress, saved us from the brink of destruction, and rescued us from the fire.\nBy my father, mother, and self, through your guardianship, Allah (swt) taught us the principles of our religion and rectified what was corrupted in our worldly matters.\nThrough your guardianship, the word of Allah (swt) was fulfilled, the blessings became magnified, and divisions were united. By your guardianship, the obligatory acts of worship are accepted. For you is the obligatory love, the elevated ranks, the praiseworthy station, and the well-known position before Allah (swt), the Mighty and Glorious. You possess the grand intercession, the great honor, and the lofty status.\n“Our Lord (azj), we have believed in what You have revealed and have followed the Messenger, so register us among the witnesses.”\n“Our Lord (azj), do not let our hearts deviate after You have guided us, and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower.”\n“Glory to our Lord (azj); indeed, the promise of our Lord (azj) is ever fulfilled.”\nO Wali of Allah (swt), there are sins between me and Allah (swt), the Mighty and Glorious, that no one can absolve except your satisfaction. By the right of the one who entrusted you with His secrets, appointed you as caretakers of His creation, and linked obedience to you with obedience to Him, I plead with you to intercede for my sins and be my intercessors. I pledge my obedience to you; whoever obeys you has obeyed Allah (swt), and whoever disobeys you has disobeyed Allah (swt). Whoever loves you loves Allah (swt), and whoever harbors hatred toward you harbors hatred toward Allah (swt).\nO Allah (swt), if I could find intercessors closer to You than Muhammad and his purified household, the righteous Imams, I would make them my intercessors. By their right, which You have made obligatory upon Yourself, I ask You to include me among those who recognize their rank and are graced by their intercession. Indeed, You are the Most Merciful of the merciful. May Allah’s (swt) blessings and peace be upon Muhammad and his family abundantly. “Sufficient for us is Allah (swt), and He is the best disposer of affairs.”",

Allah (swt) elevated you to the most exalted station of the honored ones, the highest ranks of the near ones, and the most elevated degrees of the messengers, where none can surpass you, none can precede you, and none can aspire to equal your rank.\nNo angel brought near, no prophet sent forth, no truthful one, no martyr, no scholar, no ignorant person, no lowly one, no virtuous one, no believing righteous person, no sinful wretched person, no oppressive tyrant, no rebellious devil, nor any creation in between bears witness except that they have been made to recognize the majesty of your station, the grandeur of your status, the greatness of your position, the completion of your light, the truth of your seats (in divine presence), the firmness of your standing, the nobility of your rank, your elevated status with Him, your honor before Him, and your nearness to Him.\nMay my father, my mother, my family, my wealth, and my lineage be sacrificed for you.\nI call Allah (swt) to witness, and I call you to witness, that I believe in you and in what you believe in, disbelieve in your enemies and in what they disbelieve in, and have clarity about your status and the misguidance of those who oppose you.

I affirm what you affirm and reject what you reject.\nI obey you, acknowledge your right, admit your superiority, uphold your knowledge, seek protection under your covenant, recognize you, and believe in your return. I affirm your reappearance and await your command. I look forward to your governance, adhere to your word, act upon your instruction, seek refuge with you, and visit you. I seek sanctuary and protection at your graves and seek intercession with Allah (swt), the Exalted, through you. I draw near to Him by your means, and I present you before all my needs, wishes, and aspirations in all my circumstances and affairs.\nI believe in your hidden and manifest (realities), your presence and absence, your first and last. I entrust all matters to you, align myself with you, and my heart is in peace with you. My views follow yours, and my support is prepared for you until Allah (swt) revives His religion through you, returns you in His days (of divine rule), manifests you for His justice, and grants you authority on His earth.\nWith you, with you, not with your enemies! I believe in you and hold your last (Imam) in the same regard as your first, and I distance myself from your enemies and from al-Jibt and al-Taghut, the devils and their followers, the oppressors against you, those who reject your rights, those who deviate from your guardianship, usurpers of your inheritance, those who doubt you, those who turn away from you, and from every entity that substitutes for you, every leader who invites to the fire.\nMay Allah (swt) keep me steadfast throughout my life in your loyalty, love, and religion. May He grant me success in obeying you, provide me with your intercession, and make me among the best of your followers who adhere to what you call towards. May He make me among those who emulate your path, walk in your way, are guided by your guidance, and are gathered in your company. May He return me during your return, allow me to rule during your government, honor me in your well-being, empower me in your days, and let my eyes be delighted tomorrow by seeing you.\nMay my father, mother, self, family, and wealth be ransomed for you. Whoever seeks Allah (swt) begins with you; whoever declares His oneness accepts from you; whoever aims towards Him turns to you. My masters, I cannot count your praises, nor can I reach the depths of your commendation or the height of your description.\nYou are the light of the righteous, guides of the virtuous, and proofs of the Almighty. Through you, Allah (swt) opens and through you, He concludes. Through you, He sends down rain, and through you, He holds the sky from falling on the earth except by His permission.\nThrough you, Allah (swt) alleviates grief and removes hardships. With you rests what His messengers conveyed and what His angels descended with. To your grandfather, the Trustworthy Spirit (Jibreel) was sent, and if the visitation is for Amir al-Mu'minin (as), say: \"To your brother, the Trustworthy Spirit was sent.\" Allah (swt) granted you what He has not granted anyone from the worlds. Every noble being bows before your nobility, every arrogant soul submits to your obedience, every tyrant yields to your excellence, and everything is humbled before you. The earth is illuminated by your light, and the successful ones attain salvation through your guardianship.\nThrough you, the path to divine satisfaction is tread, while upon those who deny your guardianship is the wrath of the Most Merciful.\nMay my father, mother, self, family, and wealth be ransomed for you. Your mention is in the remembrance of those who remember, your names are among the finest of names, your bodies among the most honored of bodies, your souls among the most purified of souls, your selves among the noblest of selves, your legacy among the greatest of legacies, and your graves among the holiest of graves.\nHow sweet are your names, how noble your selves, how exalted your station, how magnificent your rank, how fulfilled your promise! Your words are light, your commands are guidance, your teachings are piety, your actions are goodness, your habit is benevolence, your nature is generosity, your conduct is truth and kindness. Your speech is wisdom and decisive, your judgment is knowledge, patience, and resolve.\nWhen goodness is mentioned, you are its beginning, its origin, its root, its essence, and its ultimate end.\nMay my father, mother, and self be sacrificed for you! How can I describe the beauty of your praise or count the favors you have bestowed? Through you, Allah (swt) removed us from humiliation, relieved us of overwhelming distress, saved us from the brink of destruction, and rescued us from the fire.\nBy my father, mother, and self, through your guardianship, Allah (swt) taught us the principles of our religion and rectified what was corrupted in our worldly matters.\nThrough your guardianship, the word of Allah (swt) was fulfilled, the blessings became magnified, and divisions were united. By your guardianship, the obligatory acts of worship are accepted. For you is the obligatory love, the elevated ranks, the praiseworthy station, and the well-known position before Allah (swt), the Mighty and Glorious. You possess the grand intercession, the great honor, and the lofty status.\n“Our Lord (azj), we have believed in what You have revealed and have followed the Messenger, so register us among the witnesses.”\n“Our Lord (azj), do not let our hearts deviate after You have guided us, and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower.”\n“Glory to our Lord (azj); indeed, the promise of our Lord (azj) is ever fulfilled.”\nO Wali of Allah (swt), there are sins between me and Allah (swt), the Mighty and Glorious, that no one can absolve except your satisfaction. By the right of the one who entrusted you with His secrets, appointed you as caretakers of His creation, and linked obedience to you with obedience to Him, I plead with you to intercede for my sins and be my intercessors. I pledge my obedience to you; whoever obeys you has obeyed Allah (swt), and whoever disobeys you has disobeyed Allah (swt). Whoever loves you loves Allah (swt), and whoever harbors hatred toward you harbors hatred toward Allah (swt).\nO Allah (swt), if I could find intercessors closer to You than Muhammad and his purified household, the righteous Imams, I would make them my intercessors. By their right, which You have made obligatory upon Yourself, I ask You to include me among those who recognize their rank and are graced by their intercession. Indeed, You are the Most Merciful of the merciful. May Allah’s (swt) blessings and peace be upon Muhammad and his family abundantly. “Sufficient for us is Allah (swt), and He is the best disposer of affairs.”",

Abu Muhammad Ja`far ibn `Ali ibn Ahmad the Jurist (RA) said: Abu Muhammad al-Hasan‬‬ ‫‪ibn Muhammad ibn `Ali ibn Sadaqah al-Qummi reported to us that Abu `Amr Muhammad ibn‬‬ ‫‪`Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz al-Ansari al-Kajji related to me that one who heard from al-Hasan ibn‬‬ ‫‪Muhammad al-Nawfali related to me that‬‬ Sulayman al-Marwazi, the theologian in Khurasan went to see al-Ma`mun. He honored him, granted him gifts and said: “My cousin `Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS) has come here from Hejaz. He likes theology and theologians. Thus, it would not be any trouble if you came on the Day of Tarwiyah to have a debate with him.” Sulayman said: “O Commander of the Faithful! I dislike questioning him in your session and among a group of Hashimites. The people will regard him as incapable when he debates with me on theology. Incapabilities are not permissible for him.” Al-Ma`mun said: “I have invited you because of my recognition of your strength. I have no intentions except for you t silence him in an argument.” Sulayman said: “O Commander of the Faithful! I will do it for you. Just bring us together, sit down, and watch.” Then al-Ma`mun sent someone after al-Rida (AS) and said: “A man from Marw who has no equal in Khurasan in theology has come, and asked for you to come to us. Come here if you do not mind.” The Imam (AS) made ablution and told us to go ahead. `Imran the Sabian was with us. We went until we arrived at al-Ma`mun’s court. Yasir and Khalid took me by the hand, and led me in to al-Mamun. When I greeted him, he asked, “Where is my brother Abu alHasan? May Allah keep him alive!” I said: “When we were coming he was putting on his clothes. He ordered us to go ahead.” Then I added, “O Commander of the Faithful! Your servant `Imran is also with me. He is right outside.” He asked, “Who is `Imran?” I answered, “He is the Sabian who became a Muslim because of you.” He said: “Let him in.” Then `Imran came in. Al-Ma`mun welcomed him, and then told him, “O Imran! You joined the Hashimites before your death!” `Imran said: “O Commander of the Faithful! Praise be to Allah who honored me by you.” Al-Ma`mun said: “O `Imran! This is Sulayman al-Marwazi, who is the theologian from Khurasan.” `Imran said: “O Commander of the Faithful! He thinks that he is the only one in Khurasan versed in theoretical principles, and he refutes appearance [bada`].” Al-Ma`mun said: “Why do you not debate with him?” `Imran said: “This depends on him.” Then al-Rida (AS) came in and asked, “What were you discussing?” `Imran said: “O son of the Prophet of Allah! This is Sulayman al-Marwazi.” Sulayman said to `Imran. “Will you be pleased with Abu al-Hasan and what he says about appearance.” `Imran said: “Yes. I will, if he presents argument like those I can present when I debate with other theologians like myself.” Al-Ma`mun said: “O Abu al-Hasan! What is your opinion regarding what they argue about?” The Imam (AS) said: O Sulayman! How could you not believe in appearance while Allah, the Mighty and High, said: But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing? And the Mighty and High said: It is He who originates the creation, then He causes it to recur again, and says: Originator of the heavens and the earth. Moreover, the Mighty and High said: He began the creation of man from clay. Also the mighty and High says: And others are mate to await Allah’s Command, whether He will chastise them, or turn in mercy to them. And the Mighty and High says: None ages, nor any diminishes from one’s life except what is in a Book. Sulayman asked, “Has anything been narrated to you on this issue from your forefathers?” The Imam (AS) said: Yes. It has been narrated on the authority of Abu `Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) who said: Verily, Allah, the Mighty and High, possesses two types of knowledge: a Guarded or Hidden Knowledge, which no one knows but He. Appearance is rooted in that knowledge. And He possesses a second type of knowledge which he has taught to His Angels (AS) and his Messengers (AS), and which the learned members of the Household of the Prophet (AS) also know. Sulayman said: “I would like you to present this from the Book of Allah, the mighty and High.” The Imam (AS) said: That is the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High to His Prophet (SA0: So turn you back upon them for you are not to be blamed. Allah first intended to destroy them, then it appeared for Allah so He said: And remind them, for verily reminding avails the believers. Sulayman said: “May I be your ransom! Tell me more.” Then al-Rida (AS) said: My father (AS) informed me on the authority of his forefathers (AS) that the Messenger of Allah (SA) said: Verily, Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to one of His Prophets to let one of the kings know that I will take away his life at such and such a time. The Prophet went to see the King and told him that. Then the King pleaded to Allah, while he was on his until he fell off of it. He said: “O Lord! Postpone m demise until I see my son grow up to undertake my affairs.” Then Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to that Prophet, “Go to that king and inform him that I have decided to postpone his death. I have added fifteen years to his life.” The Prophet said: “O Lord! You know very well that I have never lied.” Then Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to him, “Verily, you are a servant ordained. Therefore, announce this to him. Allah is never questioned about what He does.” Then the Imam (AS) turned towards Sulayman and said: “I think you have the same opinion as the Jews in this regard.” Sulayman said: “I seek refuge in Allah from such a thing. What have the Jews said?” The Imam (AS) said: The Jews say, `God’s hand is tied up. They mean that Allah has finished working, is sitting back, and does not create anything else. However, Allah, the Mighty and High, has given them the following answer: Be their hands tied up, and be they cursed for what they say. I have also heard a group of people asking my father Musa ibn Ja`far (AS) about appearance, so he said: “What do the people refute from the appearance, while Allah mighty delay the affairs of some people for a decision regarding them?” Sulayman asked, “can you tell me for what has the following verse been revealed? Verily, We have revealed this (Qur’an) in the Night of Power. The Imam (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Allah, the Mighty and High, decides the destiny for that year including life or death, good or evil, and sustenance on the Night of Power. Whatever He destines on that night comes to be.” Sulayman said: “Now I understand. May I be your ransom! Please tell me more.” The Imam (AS) said: O Sulayman! Some of the affairs are up to Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, and what He wills. He can expedite what He wills, and delay what He wills. O Sulayman, `Ali (AS) used to say, “Knowledge is of two types: Knowledge which Allah has taught His Angels and His Messengers, and knowledge which He has hidden, and of which none of His Creation is aware. What Allah has taught His Angels and His Messengers will be done, for He does not belie Himself, His Angels or His Messengers. It is through His Hidden Knowledge that He expedites or delays what He wills, removes what He wills, and asserts what He wishes to assert. Sulayman told al-Ma`mun, “O Commander of the Faithful! Allah willing, from this day on I will not refute or deny the doctrine of appearance.” Al-Ma`mun said: ”O Sulayman! Ask Abu al-Hasan whatever you wish. Just listen carefully and be fair.” Sulayman said: “O my Mater! May I question you?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Ask whatever you wish.” Sulayman said, “What is your view about someone who considers the Divine Will to be a name or an attribute like the `Ever-Living,’ the `All-Hearing,’ the `All-Seeing,’ and the `Omnipotent’?” Al-Rida (AS) replied, You claim that things have emerged and become different because He so willed and intended. However, you do not say that things have emerged and become different, because He is All-Hearing and All-Seeing. This is a proof that they (i.e. Will and Intent) are not similar to attributes such as the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and the Omnipotent. Sulayman said: “He has always been an Intender.” The Imam (AS) answered him, “O Sulayman! Is His Intent something other than Him?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (A) said: “Then you have proved that there has always been something alongwith Him forever.” Sulayman said: “No. I have not.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Has intent emerged?” Sulayman said: “No. It has not emerged.” Then al-Ma`mun shouted at him and said: “O Sulayman! Are you showing obstinacy, and giving vague answers to such a person as him. You must be fair. Do not you see that you are surrounded by intellectuals?” Then he said: “O Abu al-Hasan! Continue your speech, since he is the theologian of Khurasan.” So the Imam (AS) repeated his question, “O Sulayman! Has it (the intent) emerged? For verily, if a thing is not sempiternal, then it has emerged, and if it has not emerged, then it is sempiternal.” Sulayman said: “His Intent is from Him just as His Hearing, His Seeing and His Knowledge are from Him.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “then is He the same as His Intent?” Sulayman answered, “No.” The Imam (AS) said: “Therefore, the intender is not like the hearing and the seeing.” Sulayman said: “surely, He intended Himself, in the same way that He heard Himself, that He was Himself, and that He knew Himself.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “What is the meaning of `He intended Himself? Did He intend to be a Thing? Did He intend to be All-Living, All-Hearing, All-Seeing or All-Powerful?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Did that occur through His Intent?” Sulayman answered, “No.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Then your statement, `He intended to be All-Living, All-Hearing, and All-Seeing’ does not make any sense, since they were not done through His Intent.” Sulayman said: “Yes. That was through His Intent.” Then al-Ma`mun and the people around him, burst into laughter. Al-Rida (AS) laughed as well and said: “Do not be too hard on the theologian from Khurasan. O Sulayman! Do you think that He has altered from state to state, and changed due to it? This is something by which Allah, the Mighty and High, cannot be described.” Sulayman remained silent. Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! May I ask you a question?” The Imam (AS) said: “Tell me about you and your companions: Do you debate with the people on theology according to what you understand and know or according to what you do not understand and do not know?” Sulayman said: “Yes! According to what w understand and know.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “What the people know is that the intender is different from the intent. The intender exists before the intent. The subject is before the object. This disproves y our statement, `The intender and the intended are the same thing.’” Sulayman said: “May I be your ransom! This is not what the people know about and understand.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “I think you have claimed to have knowledge without understanding it. You have said: `Intending is like hearing and seeing’ while this view is not based on knowledge and intellect.” Sulayman could not answer. Then Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Does Allah, the Mighty and High, have knowledge of all that is in Paradise and the Fire?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: “If Allah, the Mighty and High, knows that something will be created in the future, will He actually create it?” Sulayman answered, “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: “If it is done to the extent that nothing else remains, can He add more to it or will He stop doing so?” Sulayman said: “He will add to them.” The Imam (AS) said: “then based on what you have said: He adds to them what He did not know would be crated.” He responded, “May I be your ransom! There is no limit for adding.” The Imam (AS) said: Then in your opinion His Knowledge does not encompass what is in the two (Paradise and Hell)_, since He does not know the limit of that. IF His Knowledge does not encompass what is therein, then He would not know what will be there before it existed. Exalted is Allah, the Elevated and High, from that! Sulayman said: “When I said he does not know about them, it was because they have no limit, and Allah, the Mighty and High, Himself has described them as eternal. Therefore, we do not want to assume an end for them.” Al-Rida (AS) said: His Knowledge of them will not limit them. There are many instances of which He has knowledge, then He adds to them, and does not take away what He has added to them. These are supported by the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High, in His Book: As often as their skins are burned away, We will change them for other skins, so that they may taste the torment. And the Mighty and High says to the inhabitants of Paradise: An unceasing gift. And the Mighty and High said: And abundant fruit, neither failing (be season) not forbidden. Therefore, the High and Mighty knows about these, and does not prevent them from accessing what is added. Will He not replace what the inhabitants of Paradise eat and drink? Sulayman said: “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: “Does the fact that he replaces the consumed food and drink mean that He has stopped granting?” Sulayman said: “No.” The Imam (AS) said: “Therefore, when whatever is consume in Paradise, Allah will replace it with other things. And the inhabitants of paradise will not be prevented from consuming them.” Sulayman said: “Well. He will limit what is added to them, and he will not give them anything else.” Al-Rida (AS) said: Then whatever is in Paradise and hell will end. O Sulayman! This is against eternity and the Book since Allah, the Mighty and High, says: For them therein shall be whatever they desire, and with Us is yet eve more. The Mighty and High says: An unceasing gift. And the Mighty and High says: Not shall they (ever) be asked to leave. And the Mighty and High says: To abide therein forever. And the Mighty and High says: And abundant fruit, nether failing (by season) nor forbidden. Sulayman remained silent. Then al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman, tell me about the intent: Is it an action or is it not?” Sulayman said: “It is an action.” The Imam (AS) said: “therefore, it has emerged, for all actions have emerged.” Sulayman said: “It is not an action.” The Imam (AS) said: “Has there then been something else with Him that is eternal?” Sulayman said: “Intending is the same as originating.” The Imam (AS) said: O Sulayman! This is exactly what you criticized of Dirar and his companions when they said that everything that Allah, the Mighty and High, has created in the heavens, the earth, the oceans or on land, such as dogs, pigs, monkeys, humans or animals, forms part of the Intent of Allah, the Mighty and High, and that Allah’s Intent lives, dies, goes away, eats , drinks, marries, gives birth, oppresses, commits immoral acts, disbelieves, and become a polytheist. You denounce this view, and oppose it. This is its limit. Sulayman said: “The intent is like hearing, seeing, and knowledge.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “You just returned to what you said before. Tell me: are hearing, seeing and knowledge created?” Sulayman said: “No.” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “How do you then refute Him? At times you say that He did not intend. At other times you say that He intended, and that His Intent is not His Action?” Sulayman said: “Surely, that is like saying, He sometimes knows, and sometimes does not know!” Al-Rida (AS) said: That is not the same, for negating the known is not like negating knowledge. However, negating the intended is negating the intent, for if the thing is not intended, there will be no intent. However, sometimes there is knowledge, but there may be no known thing. This is like seeing. Man may be able to see, but there may be nothing there for him to see. Likewise, there may be knowledge, while there is nothing to be known. Sulayman said: “the intent is created.” The Imam (AS) said: “Therefore, it has emerged, and is not like hearing and seeing, for hearing and seeing are not created, and the intent is created.” Sulayman said: “The Intent is one of His Eternal Attributes.” The Imam (AS) answered, “Therefore, man must be eternal, for his attribute is eternal.” Sulayman said: “No, because He has not carried out of the intent.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Khurasani! How often you make mistakes! Are things not made according to His Intent and His Words?” Sulayman said: “No.” The Imam (AS) said: If things are not made according to His Intent or Will, nor His Command or His Practice, then how are they made? Exalted is Allah from that!” Sulayman could not respond. Then al-Rida (AS) asked, “Will you not tell me about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: When We intend to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to those of its people who lead easy lives (to obey Us), and yet they transgress in it. By this `We intend’ He means that He emerges the intent?” Sulayman said to him, “Yes.” The Imam (AS) replied to him, “If He crates the intent, then your statement that `the intent is He Himself or is a part of Him is futile, for it is not possible that He emerged Himself as His State never changes. Exalted is Allah from that!” Sulayman asked, “Does He not mean by that that He caused the intent to emerge?” The Imam (AS) asked, “What would He man by that?” Sulayman said: “He means doing something.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Woe unto you! How many times have you repeated this issue? I have told you that the intent is emerged, since the action of a thing is emerged.” Sulayman said: “Then this has no meaning.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Do you then think that He describes Himself with intent which has no meaning? If the intent has no eternal or emerged meaning, then that will nullify your statement, `Allah has always been the Intender.” Sulayman said: “I meant to say that the intent is one of the Eternal Actions of Allah.” The Imam (AS) said; “Do you know the eternal cannot be created or emerged and eternal simultaneously?” Sulayman could not answer. Al-Rida (AS) continued, “Never mind! Complete your questions.” Sulayman said: “Did you say that intent is one of His Attributes?” Al-Rida (AS) said; “How many times will you repeat that the intent is one of His Attributes. Are His Attributes emerged or are they eternal?” Sulayman said: “they are emerged.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Allah is the Greatest! You are telling me that the intent in emerged, even though it is one of His Eternal Attributes. Therefore, He has not intended anything!” The Imam (AS) added, Whatever is eternal is not created.” Sulayman said: “Things are not the same as the intent, and He did not intend anything.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Are you suggesting that He created what He did not intend to create? This is an attribute of someone who does not know what he is doing. Exalted is Allah from that!” Sulayman said: “O my Master! I have already informed you that the intent is like hearing, seeing and knowing.” Al-Ma`mun said: “O Sulayman! Woe unto you! How often have you erred, and how often have you repeated yourself! Cease and address another issue since you seem unable to provide a proper answer.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Commander of the Faithful! Leave him alone! Do not interrupt his questions, since then he will regard it as an argument (against me). O Sulayman! Speak.” Sulayman said: “I have already informed you that the intent is like hearing, seeing and knowing.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Never mind! Tell me whether the intent has one meaning or several meanings.” Sulayman said: “It has one meaning.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Is the meaning of all the intents then the same?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: If its meanings are the same, then it must be that the intent to stand up is the same as the intent to sit down, or that the intent to live is the same as the intent to die. If His Intent is all one thing, then none of His Desires will take precedence over any others. None will be any different from any others. They will all be one thing. Sulayman replied, “Surely, the meanings are different.” The Imam (AS) said: “Then, tell me about the Intender. Is it the same as the intent or is it something else?” Sulayman said: “Yes. It is the same as the intent.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Then according to you the intender is something else, since it is the same as the intent.” Sulayman said: “O my Master! The intent is not the same as the intender.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Then the intent is emerged. Otherwise, it must be that something else existed along with Him. Understand this well, and continue on with your questions.” Sulayman said: “The intent is one of His Names.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Did He give Himself that name?” Sulayman replied, “No, He did not give Himself that name.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Therefore, you have not right to give Him a name which He did not give to Himself?” Sulayman said: “But He has described Himself as the Intender.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “the fact that He has described Himself as the Intender does not mean that He wanted to inform us that He is the Intent, or that the Intent is one of His Names.” Sulayman said: “that is because His Intent is the same as His Knowledge.” AlRida (AS) said: “O ignorant man! If He knows something, does that not mean that He has intended it?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” The Imam (AS) asked, “However, if He does not intent something, does that mean that He does not know it?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: What is your source for that statement? What proof do you have that His Intent is the same as His Knowledge? He may know something, but never intent it. This is supported by His Word the Mighty and High: If We wished, We would certainly take away that which We revealed to you. He knows how to take it away, but He never will. Sulayman said: “That is because He has finished administering the affairs of creation, and will not add anything to what He has destined.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “this is what the Jews say. Then how has the Mighty and High said: Call unto Me; I will answer you. Sulayman said: “He means that He has the power to do so.” The Imam (AS) said: Does He make a promise that He will not fulfill? And if so, then why has He said that He adds to creation whatever He wills. And the Mighty and High said: Allah effaces (of it) whatever He pleases, and confirms (what He wi9lls); with Him is the mother of the Book. Has He finished administering the affairs of creation?” Sulayman could not answer. Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Does He know that a human being will come into existence, while He does not intend to create a human being ever again? Can a person die today, while He does not intend for him to die today?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “Does He know what He intends exists? And does He know that what He has not intended does not exist?” Sulayman said: “He knows that both of them exist.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Therefore, He knows that man is simultaneously alive and dead, is standing and sitting, is blind and seeing. This is impossible.” Sulayman said: “May I be your ransom! He knows that one of them will exist.” The Imam (AS) said: “Do not worry. Which one will exist? The one which He intended or the one which He did not intended?” Sulayman said: “The one He intended will exist!” Al-Rida (AS), al-Ma`mun, and the scholars started to laugh. Al-Rida (AS) said: You have erred and strayed from your initial argument that `He knows that some people will die today, while He has not intended to make them die today, and that He creates creatures, while He does not intend to created them.’ If you hold that knowledge does not apply to what He has not intended, then He alone know what He has intended. Sulayman said; “My statement is that the intent is neither Him nor something other than Him!” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O ignorant man! If you say that He is separate from His Intent, then you are saying that His Intent is something other than Him. If you say that He is not separate from His Intent, then you have regarded His Intent equal to Him.” Sulayman asked, “Does He know hoe He creates things?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Yes.” Sulaymand said: “surely this establishes something.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “what you have said is impossible because a man may know how to build a wall without building a wall; a man may know how to sew without sewing anything; or a man may know how t do something well without making it. Then al-Rida (AS) added, “O Sulayman! Does He know that He is One without anything with Him?” Sulayman replied, “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Does this establish something?” Sulayman said: “He does not know that He is One without anything with Him.” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “Do you know that?” Sulayman replied, “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Therefore, you are more knowledgeable than Him!” Sulayman said: “This is impossible.” The Imam (AS) said: “Is it impossible in your view that He is One without anything with Him, that He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing, All-Wise, All-Knowing, and All-Powerful?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: Then how did Allah, the Mighty and High, inform that He is One, Ever-Living, AllHearing, All-Seeing, All-Knowing, All-Aware, if He did not know that? This rejects and belies what He has said. Exalted is Allah from that!” Then Al-Rida (AS) asked him, “How does He intend to make something He does not know how to make? If a creator does not know how to create something before he creates it, then he is perplexed. Exalted is Allah from that! Sulayman said: “Intent is the same as Omnipotence.” Al-Rida (AS) said: He, the Mighty and High, has power over what He does not intend. There is no escape from that for He, the Blessed and Exalted, said: If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent by inspiration. If intent is the same as omnipotence, He had intend to take it away for His Omnipotence. Sulayman remained silent. At this time Al-Ma`mun said: “O Sulayman! This is the most learned of the Hashimites!” Then the people dispersed. The Compiler of this book says: Al-Ma`mun was bringing together theologians of various schools of Islam and other religions who had deviated from the Straight Path, in an attempt to embarrass al-Rida and defeat him in debate. This was motivated by al-Ma`mun’s jealousy of him, and due to the stature that al-Rida`s (AS) knowledge gave him. However, all those who debated with him (AS) ended up acknowledging his nobility, and were convinced by the proofs presented by the Imam (AS). This was because Allah, Exalted by His Remembrance, honored His Word, accomplished His Light and assisted His Proof. This is what the Blessed and Exalted has promised in His Book: Verily, We help Our messengers and those who believe in the life of this world, by `those who believe,’ He mean the Immaculate Imams (AS), their followers, those who recognize them, and those who acquire knowledge from them. He assists them with proofs against their rivals for as long as they are in this world. He will treat them likewise in the Hereafter. Verily, Allah does not act against His Promise.",
    "arabicText": "1 - حدثنا أبو محمد جعفر بن علي بن أحمد الفقيه رضي الله عنه، قال: أخبرنا أبو محمد الحسن بن محمد بن علي بن صدقة القمي، قال: حدثني أبو عمرو محمد بن عمر بن عبد العزيز الأنصاري الكجي، قال: حدثني من سمع الحسن بن محمد النوفلي يقول: قدم سليمان المروزي متكلم خراسان على المأمون فأكرمه ووصله ثم قال له: إن ابن عمي علي بن موسى قدم علي من الحجاز  وهو يحب الكلام وأصحابه، فلا عليك أن تصير إلينا يوم التروية لمناظرته، فقال سليمان: يا أمير المؤمنين إني أكره أن أسأل مثله في مجلسك في جماعة من بني هاشم فينتقص عند القوم إذا كلمني  ولا يجوز الاستقصاء عليه، قال المأمون: إنما وجهت إليك لمعرفتي بقوتك وليس مرادي إلا أن تقطعه عن حجة واحدة فقط: فقال سليمان: حسبك يا أمير المؤمنين. اجمع بيني وبينه وخلني وإياه وألزم  فوجه المأمون إلى الرضا عليه السلام فقال: إنه قدم علينا رجل من أهل مرو وهو واحد خراسان من أصحاب الكلام، فإن خف عليك أن تتجشم المصير إلينا فعلت، فنهض عليه السلام للوضوء وقال لنا: تقدموني وعمران الصابئ معنا فصرنا إلى الباب فأخذ ياسر وخالد بيدي فأدخلاني على المأمون، فلما سلمت قال: أين أخي أبو الحسن أبقاه الله، قلت: خلفته يلبس ثيابه وأمرنا أن نتقدم، ثم قلت: يا أمير المؤمنين إن عمران مولاك. معي وهو بالباب، فقال: من عمران؟ قلت: الصابئ الذي أسلم على يديك  قال: فليدخل فدخل فرحب به المأمون، ثم قال له: يا عمران لم تمت حتى صرت من بني هاشم، قال: الحمد لله الذي شرفني بكم يا أمير المؤمنين، فقال له المأمون: يا عمران هذا سليمان المروزي متكلم خراسان، قال عمران: يا أمير المؤمنين إنه يزعم أنه واحد خراسان في النظر وينكر البداء، قال: فلم لا تناظره؟ قال عمران: ذلك إليه، فدخل الرضا عليه السلام فقال: في أي شئ كنتم؟ قال عمران: يا ابن رسول الله هذا سليمان المروزي، فقال سليمان: أترضى بأبي الحسن وبقوله فيه؟ قال عمران: قد رضيت بقول أبي الحسن في البداء على أن يأتيني فيه بحجة أحتج بها على نظرائي من أهل النظر. قال المأمون: يا أبا الحسن ما تقول فيما تشاجرا فيه؟ قال: وما أنكرت من البداء يا سليمان، والله عز وجل يقول: ﴿أو لا يذكر الإنسان أنا خلقناه من قبل ولم يك شيئا﴾ (١) ويقول عز وجل: ﴿وهو الذي يبدؤا الخلق ثم يعيده﴾ (٢) و يقول: ﴿بديع السماوات والأرض﴾ (٣) ويقول عز وجل: ﴿يزيد في الخلق ما يشاء﴾ (٤) ويقول: ﴿وبدأ خلق الإنسان من طين﴾ (٥) ويقول عز وجل: ﴿و آخرون مرجون لأمر الله إما يعذبهم وإما يتوب عليهم﴾ (٦) ويقول عز وجل: ﴿وما يعمر من معمر ولا ينقص من عمره إلا في كتاب﴾ (٧) قال سليمان: هل رويت فيه شيئا عن آبائك؟ قال: نعم، رويت عن أبي عبد الله عليه السلام أنه قال: (إن الله عز وجل علمين: علما مخزونا مكنونا لا يعلمه إلا هو، من ذلك يكون البداء، و علما علمه ملائكته ورسله، فالعلماء من أهل بيت نبيه يعلمونه) (٨) قال سليمان: أحب أن تنزعه لي من كناب الله عز وجل، قال عليه السلام: قول الله عز وجل لنبيه صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم: ﴿فتول عنهم فما أنت بملوم﴾ (٩) أراد هلاكهم ثم بدا لله فقال: ﴿وذكر فإن الذكرى تنفع المؤمنين﴾  قال سليمان: زدني جعلت فداك، قال الرضا عليه السلام: لقد أخبرني أبي عن آبائه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم قال: إن الله عز وجل أوحى إلى نبي من أنبيائه: أن أخبر فلان الملك أني متوفيه إلى كذا وكذا، فأتاه ذلك النبي فأخبره، فدعا الله الملك وهو على سريره حتى سقط من السرير، فقال: يا رب أجلني حتى يشب طفلي وأقضي أمري، فأوحى الله عز وجل إلى ذلك النبي أن ائت فلان الملك (١) فأعلمه أني قد أنسيت في أجله وزدت في عمره خمس عشرة سنة، فقال ذلك النبي: يا رب إنك لتعلم أني لم أكذب قط، فأوحى الله عز وجل إليه: إنما أنت عبد مأمور فأبلغه ذلك، والله لا يسأل عما يفعل (٢). ثم التفت إلى سليمان فقال: أحسبك ضاهيت اليهود في هذا الباب، قال: أعوذ بالله من ذلك، وما قالت اليهود؟ قال: قالت: (يد الله مغلولة) يعنون أن الله قد فرغ من الأمر فليس يحدث شيئا، فقال الله عز وجل: ﴿غلت أيديهم ولعنوا بما قالوا﴾  ولقد سمعت قوما سألوا أبي موسى بن جعفر عليهما السلام، عن البداء فقال: و ما ينكر الناس من البداء وأن يقف الله قوما يرجيهم لأمره ؟ قال سليمان: ألا تخبرني عن (إنا أنزلناه في ليلة القدر) في أي شئ أنزلت؟ قال الرضا: يا سليمان ليلة القدر يقدر الله عز وجل فيها ما يكون من السنة إلى السنة من حياة أو موت أو خير أو شر أو رزق، فما قدره من تلك الليلة فهو من المحتوم، قال سليمان: ألآن قد فهمت جعلت فداك فزدني، قال عليه السلام: يا سليمان إن من الأمور أمورا موقوفة عند الله تبارك وتعالى يقدم منها ما يشاء ويؤخر ما يشاء، يا سليمان إن عليا عليه السلام كان يقول: العلم علمان: فعلم علمه الله وملائكته ورسله، فما علمه ملائكته ورسله فإنه يكون ولا يكذب نفسه ولا ملائكته ولا رسله، وعلم عنده مخزون لم يطلع عليه أحدا من خلقه  يقدم منه ما يشاء ويؤخر منه ما يشاء، ويمحو ما يشاء ويثبت ما يشاء، قال سليمان للمأمون: يا أمير المؤمنين لا أنكر بعد يومي هذا البداء ولا كذب به إن شاء الله . فقال المأمون: يا سليمان سل أبا الحسن عما بدا لك وعليك بحسن الاستماع والإنصاف، قال سليمان: يا سيدي أسألك؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: سل عما بدا لك قال: ما تقول فيمن جعل الإرادة اسما وصفة مثل حي وسميع وبصير وقدير؟ قال الرضا عليه السلام: إنما قلتم حدثت الأشياء واختلفت لأنه شاء وأراد، ولم تقولوا حدثت واختلفت لأنه سميع بصير، فهذا دليل على أنها ليست بمثل سميع بصير ولا قدير، قال سليمان: فإنه لم يزل مريدا، قال: يا سليمان فإرادته غيره؟ قال: نعم، قال: فقد أثبت معه شيئا غيره لم يزل، قال سليمان: ما أثبت، قال الرضا عليه السلام: أهي محدثة؟ قال سليمان: لا ما هي محدثة، فصاح به المأمون وقال: يا سليمان مثله يعايا أو يكابر، عليك بالإنصاف أما ترى من حولك من أهل النظر، ثم قال: كلمه يا أبا الحسن فإنه متكلم خراسان، فأعاد عليه المسألة فقال: هي محدثة يا سليمان فإن الشئ إذا لم يكن أزليا كان محدثا وإذا لم يكن محدثا كان أزليا، قال سليمان: إرادته منه كما أن سمعه منه وبصره منه وعلمه منه، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فإرادته نفسه؟! قال: لا، قال عليه السلام: فليس المريد مثل السميع و البصير، قال سليمان: إنما أراد نفسه كما سمع نفسه وأبصر نفسه وعلم نفسه، قال الرضا عليه السلام: ما معنى أراد نفسه أراد أن يكون شيئا أو أراد أن يكون حيا أو سميعا أو بصيرا أو قديرا؟! قال: نعم، قال الرضا عليه السلام: أفبإرادته كان ذلك؟! قال سليمان: لا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فليس لقولك: أراد أن يكون حيا سميعا بصيرا معنى إذا لم يكن ذلك بإرادته، قال سليمان: بلى قد كان ذلك بإرادته، فضحك المأمون ومن حوله وضحك الرضا عليه السلام، ثم قال لهم: ارفقوا بمتكلم خراسان يا سليمان فقد حال عندكم عن حالة وتغير عنها  وهذا مما لا يوصف الله عز وجل به، فانقطع. ثم قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا سليمان أسألك مسألة، قال: سل جعلت فداك قال: أخبرني عنك وعن أصحابك تكلمون الناس بما يفقهون ويعرفون أو بما لا يفقهون ولا يعرفون؟! قال: بل بما يفقهون ويعرفون  قال الرضا عليه السلام: فالذي يعلم الناس أن المريد غير الإرادة وأن المريد قبل الإرادة وأن الفاعل قبل المفعول وهذا يبطل قولكم: إن الإرادة والمريد شئ واحد، قال: جعلت فداك ليس ذاك منه على ما يعرف الناس ولا على ما يفقهون، قال عليه السلام: فأراكم ادعيتم علم ذلك بلا معرفة، وقلتم: الإرادة كالسمع والبصر  إذا كان ذلك عندكم على ما لا يعرف ولا يعقل، فلم يحر جوابا. ثم قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا سليمان هل يعلم الله عز وجل جميع ما في الجنة والنار؟! قال سليمان: نعم، قال: أفيكون ما علم الله عز وجل أنه يكون من ذلك؟!  قال: نعم، قال: فإذا كان حتى لا يبقى منه شئ إلا كان أيزيدهم أو يطويه عنهم؟! قال سليمان: بل يزيدهم، قال: فأراه في قولك: قد زادهم ما لم يكن في علمه أنه يكون  قال: جعلت فداك والمزيد لا غاية له (١) قال عليه السلام: فليس يحيط علمه عندكم بما يكون فيهما إذا لم يعرف غاية ذلك، و إذا لم يحط علمه بما يكون فيهما لم يعلم ما يكون فيهما قبل أن يكون، تعالى الله عن ذلك علوا كبيرا، قال سليمان: إنما قلت: لا يعلمه لأنه لا غاية لهذا لأن الله عز وجل وصفهما بالخلود وكرهنا أن نجعل لهما انقطاعا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: ليس علمه بذلك بموجب لانقطاعه عنهم لأنه قد يعلم ذلك ثم يزيدهم ثم لا يقطعه عنهم، و كذلك قال الله عز وجل في كتابه: ﴿كلما نضجت جلودهم بدلناهم جلودا غيرها ليذوقوا العذاب﴾ (٢) وقال عز وجل لأهل الجنة: ﴿عطاء غير مجذوذ﴾  وقال عز وجل: (وفاكهة كثيرة * لا مقطوعة ولا ممنوعة)  فهو عز وجل يعلم ذلك ولا يقطع عنهم الزيادة، أرأيت ما أكل أهل الجنة وما شربوا أليس يخلف مكانه؟! قال بلى، قال: أفيكون يقطع ذلك عنهم وقد أخلف مكانه؟! قال سليمان: لا، قال: فكذلك كل ما يكون فيها  إذا أخلف مكانه فليس بمقطوع عنهم، قال سليمان بل يقطعه عنهم فلا يزيدهم  قال الرضا عليه السلام: إذا يبيد ما فيهما، و هذا يا سليمان إبطال الخلود وخلاف الكتاب لأن الله عز وجل يقول: (لهم ما يشاؤون فيها ولدينا مزيد) (١) ويقول عز وجل: (عطاء غير مجذوذ) ويقول عز وجل: ﴿وما هم منها بمخرجين﴾  ويقول عز وجل: (خالدين فيها ح أبدا)  ويقول عز وجل: (وفاكهة كثيرة لا مقطوعة ولا ممنوعة) فلم يحر جوابا. ثم قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا سليمان ألا تخبرني عن الإرادة فعل هي أم غير فعل؟ قال: بل هي فعل، قال: فهي محدثة لأن الفعل كله محدث، قال: ليست بفعل، قال: فمعه غيره لم يزل، قال سليمان: الإرادة هي الانشاء، قال: يا سليمان هذا الذي ادعيتموه  على ضرار وأصحابه  من قولهم: إن كل ما خلق الله عز وجل في سماء أو أرض أو بحر أو بر من كلب أو خنزير أو قرد أو إنسان أو دابة إرادة الله عز وجل وإن إرادة الله عز وجل تحيي وتموت وتذهب وتأكل وتشرب وتنكح وتلد  وتظلم وتفعل الفواحش وتكفر، وتشرك، فتبراء منها وتعاديها و هذا حدها . قال سليمان: إنها كالسمع والبصر والعلم، قال الرضا عليه السلام: قد رجعت إلى هذا ثانية، فأخبرني عن السمع والبصر والعلم أمصنوع؟ قال سليمان: لا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فكيف نفيتموه  فمرة قلتم لم يرد ومرة قلتم أراد، وليست بمفعول له؟! قال سليمان: إنما ذلك كقولنا مرة علم ومرة لم يعلم (١) قال الرضا عليه السلام: ليس ذلك سواء لأن نفي المعلوم ليس بنفي العلم، ونفي المراد نفي الإرادة أن تكون، لأن الشئ إذا لم يكن إرادة (٢) وقد يكون العلم ثابتا وإن لم يكن المعلوم، بمنزلة البصر فقد يكون الإنسان بصيرا وإن لم يكن المبصر، ويكون العلم ثابتا وإن لم يكن المعلوم (٣). قال سليمان: إنها مصنوعة، قال عليه السلام: فهي محدثة ليست كالسمع والبصر لأن السمع والبصر ليسا بمصنوعين وهذه مصنوعة، قال سليمان: إنها صفة من صفاته لم تزل، قال: فينبغي أن يكون الإنسان لم يزل لأن صفته لم تزل، قال سليمان: لا لأنه لم يفعلها، قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا خراساني ما أكثر غلطك، أفليس بإرادته وقوله تكون الأشياء؟! (٤) قال سليمان: لا، قال: فإذا لم يكن بإرادته ولا مشيته ولا أمره ولا المباشرة فكيف يكون ذلك؟! تعالى الله عن ذلك، فلم يحر جوابا (٥). ثم قال الرضا عليه السلام: ألا تخبرني عن قول الله عز وجل: ﴿وإذا أردنا أن نهلك قرية أمرنا مترفيها ففسقوا فيها﴾  يعني بذلك أنه يحدث إرادة؟! قال له: نعم، قال: فإذا أحدث إرادة كان قولك إن الإرادة هي هو أم شئ منه باطلا لأنه لا يكون أن يحدث نفسه ولا يتغير عن حاله، تعالى الله عن ذلك، قال سليمان: إنه لم يكن عني بذلك أنه يحدث إرادة، قال: فما عني به؟ قال: عني فعل الشئ قال الرضا عليه السلام: ويلك كم تردد هذه المسألة، وقد أخبرتك أن الإرادة محدثة لأن فعل الشئ محدث، قال: فليس لها معنى، قال: الرضا عليه السلام: قد وصف نفسه عندكم حتى وصفها بالإرادة بما لا معنى له، فإذا لم يكن لها معنى قديم ولا حديث بطل قولكم: إن الله لم يزل مريدا. قال سليمان: إنما عنيت أنها فعل من الله لم يزل، قال: ألا تعلم أن ما لم يزل لا يكون مفعولا وحديثا وقديما في حالة واحدة؟ فلم يحر جوابا. قال الرضا عليه السلام: لا بأس، أتمم مسألتك، قال سليمان: قلت: إن الإرادة صفة من صفاته، قال الرضا عليه السلام: كم تردد علي أنها صفه من صفاته، وصفته محدثة أو لم تزل؟! قال سليمان: محدثة، قال الرضا عليه السلام: الله أكبر فالإرادة محدثة وأن كانت صفة من صفاته لم تزل، فلم يرد شيئا.  قال الرضا عليه السلام: إن ما لم يزل لا يكون مفعولا، قال سليمان: ليس الأشياء إرادة ولم يرد شيئا.  قال الرضا عليه السلام: وسوست يا سليمان فقد فعل وخلق ما لم يرد خلقه ولا فعله، وهذه صفة من لا يدري ما فعل، تعالى الله عن ذلك. قال سليمان: يا سيدي قد أخبرتك أنها كالسمع والبصر والعلم، قال المأمون: ويلك يا سليمان كم هذا الغلط والتردد اقطع هذا وخذ في غيره إذ ليست تقوى على هذا الرد، قال الرضا عليه السلام: دعه يا أمير المؤمنين، لا تقطع عليه مسألته فيجعلها حجة، تكلم يا سليمان، قال: قد أخبرتك أنها كالسمع والبصر والعلم، قال الرضا عليه السلام: لا بأس، أخبرني عن معنى هذه أمعنى واحد أم معان مختلفة؟! قال سليمان: بل معنى واحد، الرضا عليه السلام: فمعنى الإرادات كلها معنى واحد؟ قال سليمان: نعم، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فإن كان معناها معنى واحدا كانت إرادة القيام وإرادة العقود وإرادة الحياة وإرادة الموت إذا كانت إرادته واحدة  لم يتقدم بعضها بعضا ولم يخالف بعضها بعضا، وكان شيئا واحدا  قال سليمان: إن معناها مختلف، قال عليه السلام: فأخبرني عن المريد أهو الإرادة أو غيرها؟! قال سليمان: بل هو الإرادة، قال الرضا عليه السلام فالمريد عندكم يختلف إن كان هو الإرادة ؟ قال: يا سيدي ليس الإرادة المريد، قال عليه السلام: فالإرادة محدثة، وإلا فمعه غيره. افهم وزد في مسألتك. قال سليمان: فإنها اسم من أسمائه، قال الرضا عليه السلام: هل سمى نفسه بذلك؟ قال سليمان: لا، لم يسم نفسه بذلك، قال الرضا عليه السلام: فليس لك أن تسميه بما لم يسم به نفسه، قال: قد وصف نفسه بأنه مريد، قال الرضا عليه السلام: ليس صفته نفسه أنه مريد إخبار عن أنه إرادة ولا إخبارا عن أن الإرادة اسم من أسمائه، قال: سليمان: لأن إرادته علمه، قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا جاهل فإذا علم الشئ فقد أراده؟ قال سليمان: أجل، قال عليه السلام: فإذا لم يرده لم يعلمه، قال سليمان: أجل، قال عليه السلام: من أين قلت ذاك، وما الدليل على أن إرادته علمه. وقد يعلم ما لا يريده أبدا، وذلك قوله عز وجل: ﴿ولئن شئنا لنذهبن بالذي أوحينا إليك﴾ (١) فهو يعلم كيف يذهب به وهو لا يذهب به أبدا، قال سليمان: لأنه قد فرغ من الأمر فليس يزيد فيه شيئا (٢) قال الرضا عليه السلام: هذا قول اليهود، فكيف قال عز وجل: (ادعوني أستجب لكم) (٣) قال سليمان: إنما عني بذلك أنه قادر عليه، قال عليه السلام: أفيعد ما لا يفي به؟! فكيف قال عز وجل: ﴿يزيد في الخلق ما يشاء﴾ (٤) و قال عز وجل: ﴿يمحوا الله ما يشاء ويثبت وعنده أم الكتاب﴾  وقد فرغ من الأمر، فلم يحر جوابا. قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا سليمان هل يعلم أن إنسانا يكون ولا يريد أن يخلق إنسانا أبدا، وأن إنسانا يموت اليوم ولا يريد أن يموت اليوم؟ قال سليمان: نعم قال الرضا عليه السلام: فيعلم أنه يكون ما يريد أن يكون أو يعلم أنه يكون ما لا يريد أن يكون؟! قال: يعلم أنهما يكونان جميعا، قال الرضا عليه السلام: إذن يعلم أن إنسانا حي ميت، قائم قاعد، أعمى بصير في حال واحدة، وهذا هو المحال، قال: جعلت فداك فإنه يعلم أنه يكون أحدهما دون الآخر، قال عليه السلام: لا بأس، فأيهما يكون، الذي أراد أن يكون أو الذي لم يرد أن يكون، قال سليمان: الذي أراد أن يكون، فضحك الرضا عليه السلام والمأمون وأصحاب المقالات. قال الرضا عليه السلام: غلطت وتركت قولك: إنه يعلم أن إنسانا يموت اليوم وهو لا يريد أن يموت اليوم وأنه يخلق خلقا وهو لا يريد أن يخلقهم، فإذا لم يجز العلم عندكم بما لم يرد أن يكون فإنما يعلم أن يكون ما أراد أن يكون . قال سليمان: فإنما قولي: إن الإرادة ليست هو ولا غيره، قال الرضا عليه السلام: يا جاهل إذا قلت: ليست هو فقد جعلتها غيره، وإذا قلت: ليست هي غيره فقد جعلتها هو، قال سليمان: فهو يعلم كيف يصنع الشئ؟ قال عليه السلام: نعم، قال سليمان: فإن ذلك إثبات للشئ  قال الرضا عليه السلام: أحلت لأن الرجل قد يحسن البناء وإن لم يبن ويحسن الخياطة وإن لم يخط ويحسن صنعة الشئ وإن لم يصنعه أبدا ثم قال له: يا سليمان هل يعلم أنه واحد لا شئ معه؟! قال: نعم، قال: أفيكون ذلك إثباتا للشئ؟! قال سليمان: ليس يعلم أنه واحد لا شئ معه. قال الرضا عليه السلام: أفتعلم أنت ذلك؟!  قال: نعم، قال: فأنت يا سليمان أعلم منه إذا، قال سليمان: المسألة محال، قال: محال عندك أنه واحد لا شئ معه وأنه سميع بصير حكيم عليم قادر؟! قال: نعم، قال عليه السلام: فكيف أخبر الله عز وجل أنه واحد حي سميع بصير عليم خبير وهو لا يعلم ذلك؟! وهذا رد ما قال وتكذيبه، تعالى الله عن ذلك، ثم قال الرضا عليه السلام: فكيف يريد صنع ما لا يدري صنعه ولا ما هو؟! وإذا كان الصانع لا يدري كيف يصنع الشئ قبل أن يصنعه فإنما هو متحير، تعالى الله عن ذلك. قال سليمان: فإن الإرادة القدرة، قال الرضا عليه السلام: وهو عز وجل يقدر على ما لا يريده أبدا، ولا بد من ذلك لأنه قال تبارك وتعالى: ﴿ولئن شئنا لنذهبن بالذي أوحينا إليك﴾  فلو كانت الإرادة هي القدرة كان قد أراد أن يذهب به لقدرته، فانقطع سليمان، قال المأمون عند ذلك: يا سليمان هذا أعلم هاشمي. ثم تفرق القوم. قال مصنف هذا الكتاب: كان المأمون يجلب على الرضا عليه السلام من متكلمي الفرق والأهواء المضلة كل من سمع به حرصا على انقطاع الرضا عليه السلام عن الحجة مع واحد منهم، وذلك حسدا منه له ولمنزلة من العلم، فكان عليه السلام لا يكلم أحدا إلا أقر له بالفضل والتزم الحجة له عليه لأن الله تعالى ذكره أبى إلا أن يعلي كلمته ويتم نوره وينصر حجته، وهكذا وعد تبارك وتعالى في كتابه فقال: (إنا لننصر رسلنا والذين آمنوا في الحياة الدنيا)  يعني بالذين آمنوا: (الأئمة الهداة عليهم السلام وأتباعهم والعارفين بهم والآخذين عنهم، ينصرهم بالحجة على مخالفيهم ما داموا في الدنيا، وكذلك يفعل بهم في الآخرة، وإن الله لا يخلف وعده.  باب النهي عن الكلام والجدال والمراء في الله عز وجل ",

Abu Muhammad Ja`far ibn `Ali ibn Ahmad the Jurist (RA) said: Abu Muhammad al-Hasan‬‬ ‫‪ibn Muhammad ibn `Ali ibn Sadaqah al-Qummi reported to us that Abu `Amr Muhammad ibn‬‬ ‫‪`Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz al-Ansari al-Kajji related to me that one who heard from al-Hasan ibn‬‬ ‫‪Muhammad al-Nawfali related to me that‬‬ ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "Sulayman al-Marwazi, the theologian in Khurasan went to see al-Ma`mun. He honored him, granted him gifts and said: “My cousin `Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS) has come here from Hejaz. He likes theology and theologians. Thus, it would not be any trouble if you came on the Day of Tarwiyah to have a debate with him.” Sulayman said: “O Commander of the Faithful! I dislike questioning him in your session and among a group of Hashimites. The people will regard him as incapable when he debates with me on theology. Incapabilities are not permissible for him.” Al-Ma`mun said: “I have invited you because of my recognition of your strength. I have no intentions except for you t silence him in an argument.” Sulayman said: “O Commander of the Faithful! I will do it for you. Just bring us together, sit down, and watch.” Then al-Ma`mun sent someone after al-Rida (AS) and said: “A man from Marw who has no equal in Khurasan in theology has come, and asked for you to come to us. Come here if you do not mind.” The Imam (AS) made ablution and told us to go ahead. `Imran the Sabian was with us. We went until we arrived at al-Ma`mun’s court. Yasir and Khalid took me by the hand, and led me in to al-Mamun. When I greeted him, he asked, “Where is my brother Abu alHasan? May Allah keep him alive!” I said: “When we were coming he was putting on his clothes. He ordered us to go ahead.” Then I added, “O Commander of the Faithful! Your servant `Imran is also with me. He is right outside.” He asked, “Who is `Imran?” I answered, “He is the Sabian who became a Muslim because of you.” He said: “Let him in.” Then `Imran came in. Al-Ma`mun welcomed him, and then told him, “O Imran! You joined the Hashimites before your death!” `Imran said: “O Commander of the Faithful! Praise be to Allah who honored me by you.” Al-Ma`mun said: “O `Imran! This is Sulayman al-Marwazi, who is the theologian from Khurasan.” `Imran said: “O Commander of the Faithful! He thinks that he is the only one in Khurasan versed in theoretical principles, and he refutes appearance [bada`].” Al-Ma`mun said: “Why do you not debate with him?” `Imran said: “This depends on him.” Then al-Rida (AS) came in and asked, “What were you discussing?” `Imran said: “O son of the Prophet of Allah! This is Sulayman al-Marwazi.” Sulayman said to `Imran. “Will you be pleased with Abu al-Hasan and what he says about appearance.” `Imran said: “Yes. I will, if he presents argument like those I can present when I debate with other theologians like myself.” Al-Ma`mun said: “O Abu al-Hasan! What is your opinion regarding what they argue about?” The Imam (AS) said: O Sulayman! How could you not believe in appearance while Allah, the Mighty and High, said: But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing? And the Mighty and High said: It is He who originates the creation, then He causes it to recur again, and says: Originator of the heavens and the earth. Moreover, the Mighty and High said: He began the creation of man from clay. Also the mighty and High says: And others are mate to await Allah’s Command, whether He will chastise them, or turn in mercy to them. And the Mighty and High says: None ages, nor any diminishes from one’s life except what is in a Book. Sulayman asked, “Has anything been narrated to you on this issue from your forefathers?” The Imam (AS) said: Yes. It has been narrated on the authority of Abu `Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) who said: Verily, Allah, the Mighty and High, possesses two types of knowledge: a Guarded or Hidden Knowledge, which no one knows but He. Appearance is rooted in that knowledge. And He possesses a second type of knowledge which he has taught to His Angels (AS) and his Messengers (AS), and which the learned members of the Household of the Prophet (AS) also know. Sulayman said: “I would like you to present this from the Book of Allah, the mighty and High.” The Imam (AS) said: That is the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High to His Prophet (SA0: So turn you back upon them for you are not to be blamed. Allah first intended to destroy them, then it appeared for Allah so He said: And remind them, for verily reminding avails the believers. Sulayman said: “May I be your ransom! Tell me more.” Then al-Rida (AS) said: My father (AS) informed me on the authority of his forefathers (AS) that the Messenger of Allah (SA) said: Verily, Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to one of His Prophets to let one of the kings know that I will take away his life at such and such a time. The Prophet went to see the King and told him that. Then the King pleaded to Allah, while he was on his until he fell off of it. He said: “O Lord! Postpone m demise until I see my son grow up to undertake my affairs.” Then Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to that Prophet, “Go to that king and inform him that I have decided to postpone his death. I have added fifteen years to his life.” The Prophet said: “O Lord! You know very well that I have never lied.” Then Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to him, “Verily, you are a servant ordained. Therefore, announce this to him. Allah is never questioned about what He does.” Then the Imam (AS) turned towards Sulayman and said: “I think you have the same opinion as the Jews in this regard.” Sulayman said: “I seek refuge in Allah from such a thing. What have the Jews said?” The Imam (AS) said: The Jews say, `God’s hand is tied up. They mean that Allah has finished working, is sitting back, and does not create anything else. However, Allah, the Mighty and High, has given them the following answer: Be their hands tied up, and be they cursed for what they say. I have also heard a group of people asking my father Musa ibn Ja`far (AS) about appearance, so he said: “What do the people refute from the appearance, while Allah mighty delay the affairs of some people for a decision regarding them?” Sulayman asked, “can you tell me for what has the following verse been revealed? Verily, We have revealed this (Qur’an) in the Night of Power. The Imam (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Allah, the Mighty and High, decides the destiny for that year including life or death, good or evil, and sustenance on the Night of Power. Whatever He destines on that night comes to be.” Sulayman said: “Now I understand. May I be your ransom! Please tell me more.” The Imam (AS) said: O Sulayman! Some of the affairs are up to Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, and what He wills. He can expedite what He wills, and delay what He wills. O Sulayman, `Ali (AS) used to say, “Knowledge is of two types: Knowledge which Allah has taught His Angels and His Messengers, and knowledge which He has hidden, and of which none of His Creation is aware. What Allah has taught His Angels and His Messengers will be done, for He does not belie Himself, His Angels or His Messengers. It is through His Hidden Knowledge that He expedites or delays what He wills, removes what He wills, and asserts what He wishes to assert. Sulayman told al-Ma`mun, “O Commander of the Faithful! Allah willing, from this day on I will not refute or deny the doctrine of appearance.” Al-Ma`mun said: ”O Sulayman! Ask Abu al-Hasan whatever you wish. Just listen carefully and be fair.” Sulayman said: “O my Mater! May I question you?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Ask whatever you wish.” Sulayman said, “What is your view about someone who considers the Divine Will to be a name or an attribute like the `Ever-Living,’ the `All-Hearing,’ the `All-Seeing,’ and the `Omnipotent’?” Al-Rida (AS) replied, You claim that things have emerged and become different because He so willed and intended. However, you do not say that things have emerged and become different, because He is All-Hearing and All-Seeing. This is a proof that they (i.e. Will and Intent) are not similar to attributes such as the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and the Omnipotent. Sulayman said: “He has always been an Intender.” The Imam (AS) answered him, “O Sulayman! Is His Intent something other than Him?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (A) said: “Then you have proved that there has always been something alongwith Him forever.” Sulayman said: “No. I have not.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Has intent emerged?” Sulayman said: “No. It has not emerged.” Then al-Ma`mun shouted at him and said: “O Sulayman! Are you showing obstinacy, and giving vague answers to such a person as him. You must be fair. Do not you see that you are surrounded by intellectuals?” Then he said: “O Abu al-Hasan! Continue your speech, since he is the theologian of Khurasan.” So the Imam (AS) repeated his question, “O Sulayman! Has it (the intent) emerged? For verily, if a thing is not sempiternal, then it has emerged, and if it has not emerged, then it is sempiternal.” Sulayman said: “His Intent is from Him just as His Hearing, His Seeing and His Knowledge are from Him.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “then is He the same as His Intent?” Sulayman answered, “No.” The Imam (AS) said: “Therefore, the intender is not like the hearing and the seeing.” Sulayman said: “surely, He intended Himself, in the same way that He heard Himself, that He was Himself, and that He knew Himself.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “What is the meaning of `He intended Himself? Did He intend to be a Thing? Did He intend to be All-Living, All-Hearing, All-Seeing or All-Powerful?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Did that occur through His Intent?” Sulayman answered, “No.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Then your statement, `He intended to be All-Living, All-Hearing, and All-Seeing’ does not make any sense, since they were not done through His Intent.” Sulayman said: “Yes. That was through His Intent.” Then al-Ma`mun and the people around him, burst into laughter. Al-Rida (AS) laughed as well and said: “Do not be too hard on the theologian from Khurasan. O Sulayman! Do you think that He has altered from state to state, and changed due to it? This is something by which Allah, the Mighty and High, cannot be described.” Sulayman remained silent. Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! May I ask you a question?” The Imam (AS) said: “Tell me about you and your companions: Do you debate with the people on theology according to what you understand and know or according to what you do not understand and do not know?” Sulayman said: “Yes! According to what w understand and know.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “What the people know is that the intender is different from the intent. The intender exists before the intent. The subject is before the object. This disproves y our statement, `The intender and the intended are the same thing.’” Sulayman said: “May I be your ransom! This is not what the people know about and understand.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “I think you have claimed to have knowledge without understanding it. You have said: `Intending is like hearing and seeing’ while this view is not based on knowledge and intellect.” Sulayman could not answer. Then Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Does Allah, the Mighty and High, have knowledge of all that is in Paradise and the Fire?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: “If Allah, the Mighty and High, knows that something will be created in the future, will He actually create it?” Sulayman answered, “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: “If it is done to the extent that nothing else remains, can He add more to it or will He stop doing so?” Sulayman said: “He will add to them.” The Imam (AS) said: “then based on what you have said: He adds to them what He did not know would be crated.” He responded, “May I be your ransom! There is no limit for adding.” The Imam (AS) said: Then in your opinion His Knowledge does not encompass what is in the two (Paradise and Hell)_, since He does not know the limit of that. IF His Knowledge does not encompass what is therein, then He would not know what will be there before it existed. Exalted is Allah, the Elevated and High, from that! Sulayman said: “When I said he does not know about them, it was because they have no limit, and Allah, the Mighty and High, Himself has described them as eternal. Therefore, we do not want to assume an end for them.” Al-Rida (AS) said: His Knowledge of them will not limit them. There are many instances of which He has knowledge, then He adds to them, and does not take away what He has added to them. These are supported by the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High, in His Book: As often as their skins are burned away, We will change them for other skins, so that they may taste the torment. And the Mighty and High says to the inhabitants of Paradise: An unceasing gift. And the Mighty and High said: And abundant fruit, neither failing (be season) not forbidden. Therefore, the High and Mighty knows about these, and does not prevent them from accessing what is added. Will He not replace what the inhabitants of Paradise eat and drink? Sulayman said: “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: “Does the fact that he replaces the consumed food and drink mean that He has stopped granting?” Sulayman said: “No.” The Imam (AS) said: “Therefore, when whatever is consume in Paradise, Allah will replace it with other things. And the inhabitants of paradise will not be prevented from consuming them.” Sulayman said: “Well. He will limit what is added to them, and he will not give them anything else.” Al-Rida (AS) said: Then whatever is in Paradise and hell will end. O Sulayman! This is against eternity and the Book since Allah, the Mighty and High, says: For them therein shall be whatever they desire, and with Us is yet eve more. The Mighty and High says: An unceasing gift. And the Mighty and High says: Not shall they (ever) be asked to leave. And the Mighty and High says: To abide therein forever. And the Mighty and High says: And abundant fruit, nether failing (by season) nor forbidden. Sulayman remained silent. Then al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman, tell me about the intent: Is it an action or is it not?” Sulayman said: “It is an action.” The Imam (AS) said: “therefore, it has emerged, for all actions have emerged.” Sulayman said: “It is not an action.” The Imam (AS) said: “Has there then been something else with Him that is eternal?” Sulayman said: “Intending is the same as originating.” The Imam (AS) said: O Sulayman! This is exactly what you criticized of Dirar and his companions when they said that everything that Allah, the Mighty and High, has created in the heavens, the earth, the oceans or on land, such as dogs, pigs, monkeys, humans or animals, forms part of the Intent of Allah, the Mighty and High, and that Allah’s Intent lives, dies, goes away, eats , drinks, marries, gives birth, oppresses, commits immoral acts, disbelieves, and become a polytheist. You denounce this view, and oppose it. This is its limit. Sulayman said: “The intent is like hearing, seeing, and knowledge.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “You just returned to what you said before. Tell me: are hearing, seeing and knowledge created?” Sulayman said: “No.” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “How do you then refute Him? At times you say that He did not intend. At other times you say that He intended, and that His Intent is not His Action?” Sulayman said: “Surely, that is like saying, He sometimes knows, and sometimes does not know!” Al-Rida (AS) said: That is not the same, for negating the known is not like negating knowledge. However, negating the intended is negating the intent, for if the thing is not intended, there will be no intent. However, sometimes there is knowledge, but there may be no known thing. This is like seeing. Man may be able to see, but there may be nothing there for him to see. Likewise, there may be knowledge, while there is nothing to be known. Sulayman said: “the intent is created.” The Imam (AS) said: “Therefore, it has emerged, and is not like hearing and seeing, for hearing and seeing are not created, and the intent is created.” Sulayman said: “The Intent is one of His Eternal Attributes.” The Imam (AS) answered, “Therefore, man must be eternal, for his attribute is eternal.” Sulayman said: “No, because He has not carried out of the intent.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Khurasani! How often you make mistakes! Are things not made according to His Intent and His Words?” Sulayman said: “No.” The Imam (AS) said: If things are not made according to His Intent or Will, nor His Command or His Practice, then how are they made? Exalted is Allah from that!” Sulayman could not respond. Then al-Rida (AS) asked, “Will you not tell me about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: When We intend to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to those of its people who lead easy lives (to obey Us), and yet they transgress in it. By this `We intend’ He means that He emerges the intent?” Sulayman said to him, “Yes.” The Imam (AS) replied to him, “If He crates the intent, then your statement that `the intent is He Himself or is a part of Him is futile, for it is not possible that He emerged Himself as His State never changes. Exalted is Allah from that!” Sulayman asked, “Does He not mean by that that He caused the intent to emerge?” The Imam (AS) asked, “What would He man by that?” Sulayman said: “He means doing something.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Woe unto you! How many times have you repeated this issue? I have told you that the intent is emerged, since the action of a thing is emerged.” Sulayman said: “Then this has no meaning.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Do you then think that He describes Himself with intent which has no meaning? If the intent has no eternal or emerged meaning, then that will nullify your statement, `Allah has always been the Intender.” Sulayman said: “I meant to say that the intent is one of the Eternal Actions of Allah.” The Imam (AS) said; “Do you know the eternal cannot be created or emerged and eternal simultaneously?” Sulayman could not answer. Al-Rida (AS) continued, “Never mind! Complete your questions.” Sulayman said: “Did you say that intent is one of His Attributes?” Al-Rida (AS) said; “How many times will you repeat that the intent is one of His Attributes. Are His Attributes emerged or are they eternal?” Sulayman said: “they are emerged.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Allah is the Greatest! You are telling me that the intent in emerged, even though it is one of His Eternal Attributes. Therefore, He has not intended anything!” The Imam (AS) added, Whatever is eternal is not created.” Sulayman said: “Things are not the same as the intent, and He did not intend anything.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Are you suggesting that He created what He did not intend to create? This is an attribute of someone who does not know what he is doing. Exalted is Allah from that!” Sulayman said: “O my Master! I have already informed you that the intent is like hearing, seeing and knowing.” Al-Ma`mun said: “O Sulayman! Woe unto you! How often have you erred, and how often have you repeated yourself! Cease and address another issue since you seem unable to provide a proper answer.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Commander of the Faithful! Leave him alone! Do not interrupt his questions, since then he will regard it as an argument (against me). O Sulayman! Speak.” Sulayman said: “I have already informed you that the intent is like hearing, seeing and knowing.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Never mind! Tell me whether the intent has one meaning or several meanings.” Sulayman said: “It has one meaning.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Is the meaning of all the intents then the same?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: If its meanings are the same, then it must be that the intent to stand up is the same as the intent to sit down, or that the intent to live is the same as the intent to die. If His Intent is all one thing, then none of His Desires will take precedence over any others. None will be any different from any others. They will all be one thing. Sulayman replied, “Surely, the meanings are different.” The Imam (AS) said: “Then, tell me about the Intender. Is it the same as the intent or is it something else?” Sulayman said: “Yes. It is the same as the intent.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Then according to you the intender is something else, since it is the same as the intent.” Sulayman said: “O my Master! The intent is not the same as the intender.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Then the intent is emerged. Otherwise, it must be that something else existed along with Him. Understand this well, and continue on with your questions.” Sulayman said: “The intent is one of His Names.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Did He give Himself that name?” Sulayman replied, “No, He did not give Himself that name.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Therefore, you have not right to give Him a name which He did not give to Himself?” Sulayman said: “But He has described Himself as the Intender.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “the fact that He has described Himself as the Intender does not mean that He wanted to inform us that He is the Intent, or that the Intent is one of His Names.” Sulayman said: “that is because His Intent is the same as His Knowledge.” AlRida (AS) said: “O ignorant man! If He knows something, does that not mean that He has intended it?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” The Imam (AS) asked, “However, if He does not intent something, does that mean that He does not know it?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: What is your source for that statement? What proof do you have that His Intent is the same as His Knowledge? He may know something, but never intent it. This is supported by His Word the Mighty and High: If We wished, We would certainly take away that which We revealed to you. He knows how to take it away, but He never will. Sulayman said: “That is because He has finished administering the affairs of creation, and will not add anything to what He has destined.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “this is what the Jews say. Then how has the Mighty and High said: Call unto Me; I will answer you. Sulayman said: “He means that He has the power to do so.” The Imam (AS) said: Does He make a promise that He will not fulfill? And if so, then why has He said that He adds to creation whatever He wills. And the Mighty and High said: Allah effaces (of it) whatever He pleases, and confirms (what He wi9lls); with Him is the mother of the Book. Has He finished administering the affairs of creation?” Sulayman could not answer. Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Does He know that a human being will come into existence, while He does not intend to create a human being ever again? Can a person die today, while He does not intend for him to die today?” Sulayman said: “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “Does He know what He intends exists? And does He know that what He has not intended does not exist?” Sulayman said: “He knows that both of them exist.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Therefore, He knows that man is simultaneously alive and dead, is standing and sitting, is blind and seeing. This is impossible.” Sulayman said: “May I be your ransom! He knows that one of them will exist.” The Imam (AS) said: “Do not worry. Which one will exist? The one which He intended or the one which He did not intended?” Sulayman said: “The one He intended will exist!” Al-Rida (AS), al-Ma`mun, and the scholars started to laugh. Al-Rida (AS) said: You have erred and strayed from your initial argument that `He knows that some people will die today, while He has not intended to make them die today, and that He creates creatures, while He does not intend to created them.’ If you hold that knowledge does not apply to what He has not intended, then He alone know what He has intended. Sulayman said; “My statement is that the intent is neither Him nor something other than Him!” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O ignorant man! If you say that He is separate from His Intent, then you are saying that His Intent is something other than Him. If you say that He is not separate from His Intent, then you have regarded His Intent equal to Him.” Sulayman asked, “Does He know hoe He creates things?” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Yes.” Sulaymand said: “surely this establishes something.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “what you have said is impossible because a man may know how to build a wall without building a wall; a man may know how to sew without sewing anything; or a man may know how t do something well without making it. Then al-Rida (AS) added, “O Sulayman! Does He know that He is One without anything with Him?” Sulayman replied, “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “Does this establish something?” Sulayman said: “He does not know that He is One without anything with Him.” Al-Rida (AS) asked, “Do you know that?” Sulayman replied, “Yes.” Al-Rida (AS) said: “O Sulayman! Therefore, you are more knowledgeable than Him!” Sulayman said: “This is impossible.” The Imam (AS) said: “Is it impossible in your view that He is One without anything with Him, that He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing, All-Wise, All-Knowing, and All-Powerful?” He replied, “Yes.” The Imam (AS) said: Then how did Allah, the Mighty and High, inform that He is One, Ever-Living, AllHearing, All-Seeing, All-Knowing, All-Aware, if He did not know that? This rejects and belies what He has said. Exalted is Allah from that!” Then Al-Rida (AS) asked him, “How does He intend to make something He does not know how to make? If a creator does not know how to create something before he creates it, then he is perplexed. Exalted is Allah from that! Sulayman said: “Intent is the same as Omnipotence.” Al-Rida (AS) said: He, the Mighty and High, has power over what He does not intend. There is no escape from that for He, the Blessed and Exalted, said: If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent by inspiration. If intent is the same as omnipotence, He had intend to take it away for His Omnipotence. Sulayman remained silent. At this time Al-Ma`mun said: “O Sulayman! This is the most learned of the Hashimites!” Then the people dispersed. The Compiler of this book says: Al-Ma`mun was bringing together theologians of various schools of Islam and other religions who had deviated from the Straight Path, in an attempt to embarrass al-Rida and defeat him in debate. This was motivated by al-Ma`mun’s jealousy of him, and due to the stature that al-Rida`s (AS) knowledge gave him. However, all those who debated with him (AS) ended up acknowledging his nobility, and were convinced by the proofs presented by the Imam (AS). This was because Allah, Exalted by His Remembrance, honored His Word, accomplished His Light and assisted His Proof. This is what the Blessed and Exalted has promised in His Book: Verily, We help Our messengers and those who believe in the life of this world, by `those who believe,’ He mean the Immaculate Imams (AS), their followers, those who recognize them, and those who acquire knowledge from them. He assists them with proofs against their rivals for as long as they are in this world. He will treat them likewise in the Hereafter. Verily, Allah does not act against His Promise.",

My father said: Ahmad ibn Idris and Muhammad ibn Yahya al-`Attar said, on the authority of‬‬ ‫‪Muhammad ibn Ahmad, on the authority of Ibrahim ibn Hashim, on the authority of‬‬ ‫‪Muhammad ibn Hammad, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Ibrahim, on the authority of Yunus‬‬ ‫‪ibn `Abd al-Rahman, that‬‬ Hisham ibn al-Hakam related the story of the Catholicos, primate of the Armenian church of the Christians, who was named Burayhah, and had been the Catholicos for seventy years. He used to research Islam, and sought to debate those Muslims who were familiar with the Christian gospels, and who were familiar with the Messiah, his attributes, arguments, and signs. \u003Cbr\u003EHe says: He had been known for that until he became famous among the Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Zoroastrians. The Christians use to be so proud of him that they would say: “If there was no one on earth in the Christian faith except Burayhah that would suffice us.” He was seeker of the truth and with that, of Islam. He had a woman with him that used to serve him and she had been with him for a long time. He use to secretly tell her about the weakness of Christianity and its weak proofs. He said: I came to know that from him. Thus, Burayhah put this matter behind him, and approached the various Muslim schools who differed a bout Islam, in search of the most learned one among them. He came asking about the Muslim leaders, their pious one, their scholars, and t heir leading intellectuals. He examined every Muslim school of though, and found nothing that satisfied him. He said: “If you leaders were on the true path, then they would have some truth with them!” \u003Cbr\u003EFinally, he learned about the Shi`ites from Hisham ibn al-Hakam. Yunus ibn `Abd al-Rahman says: Hisham said to me. I was sitting in my shop at the door of al-Karkh while a group of people were reciting the Qur’an to me. I was suddenly taken aback by a group of Christian clergymen. There were approximately one hundred men, dressed in the black clothing and chasubles (of the Coptic priests) and the Great Catholicos. Burayhah was among them. They came down around my shop and placed a chair for Burayhah to sit on. The bishops and monks stood learning over their staffs, and on their heads were their chasubles. Burayhah addressed me and said: “I have exhausted every single Muslim theologian in debate regarding Christianity, and they had nothing that impressed me. Hence, I have come to you wishing to debate Islam.” He says: Hisham laughed and said: “O Burayhah! If you expect me to give you the same type of signs that he Messiah gave, you have come to the wrong place as I am not the Messiah, not even close. I would never critics him, though, as he was one of the purified ones, who was humble in character, yet sublime in spirituality. The Signs of Allah wee manifest in him.” \u003Cbr\u003EBurayhah responded, “Your words astonish me.” Hisham said: “If you want to argue then go ahead.” Burayhah said: “Yes. I certainly want to question you: What is the physical tie between your Prophet and the Messiah?’ Hisham replied, “He is the son of his maternal grandfather, because Jesus is from the children of Ishaq, and Muhammad (SA) is from the children of Isma`il.” Burayhah asked, How do you relate him to his father?” Hisham answered, “If you want his lineage from your view, I will inform you of it, and if yo want his linage according to us, I will inform you of that.” Burayhah enquired, “I want his lineage according to us.” Burayhah says that I was thinking that if he described his lineage according to us, I would overpower him. So I said: “Describe his lineage the way we relate it.” Hisham explained, “Yes. You say: “He is without beginning from the one without beginning. Then who is the Father and who is the Son?” Burayhah said: “He who came unto the Earth is the Son.” Hisham asked, “He who came unto the Earth is the Father.” He said: “The Son is the messenger of the Father.” Hisham added, “Verily, the Father is wiser than the Son, because the Father is the Creator.” Burayhah said: “Verily, the Father and the Son are both the Creators.” Hisham continued, “What prevented them from coming down to Earth together like they were together when they created the world?” Burayhah replied, “How do they associate while they are both one thing? They differ only by name.” Hisham responded, “Verily, they unite with the name.” Burayhah said: “This statement is unknown.” Hisham said: “This statement is well-known,” Burayhah responded, “Verily, the Son is connected to the Father.” Hisham replied, “Verily, the Son is disconnected from the Father.” He replied, “This is contrary to what the people would think.” \u003Cbr\u003EHisham explained, “If what the people think is true, then I have overcome you for the Father was when the Son was not. Is that what you are saying, O Burayhah?” He answered, “I do not say this.” Hisham responded, “Then why did you seek to confirm your beliefs on the beliefs of those whom you reject?” He said: “Verily, the Father is a name and the Son is a name, and the eternal has decreed them.” Hisham said: “Are the two names without beginning? Are they eternal like the Father and the Son? Burayhah declared, “No, The names are originated.” He responded, “You have certainly made the Father a Son, and the Son a Father. If the Son brought these names about, and not the Father, then he is the Father. And if the Father brought these names about, and not the Son, then he is the Father, and the Son is the Father. Thus, there is no Son here.” Burayhah said: “Verily, the Son is a name of the Holy Spirit when it came down to the Earth.” Hisham responded, “What was its name prior to coming down to Earth?” Burayhah continued on, baffled: “Its name is the Son whether it came down or did not came down.” Hisham advocated, “So before the coming down of this Spirit, it was all one but it had two names.” He said: “It is all one; one Spirit.” Hisham acclaimed, “You are pleased to make some of it the Son and some of it the Father.” Burayhah replied, “No, because the name of the Father and the name of the Son are one.” Hisham said: “Therefore, the Son is the Father of the Father, and the Father is Father of the Son, and there is one Son.” \u003Cbr\u003EThe bishops said to Burayhah with one voice: “Nothing like this has ever happened to you, stand up!” Thus, Burayhah was confused and wanted to leave, so Hisham attached and said: What prevents you from embracing Islam? Is there any rancour in your heart? Then say it, otherwise I will ask you a question about Christianity. I will give you the night to think about it. Then, when you wake up, you will only be interested in me. The bishops said: “Do not ask him the question, for it may create doubts about your faith.” Burayhah said: “Say it, O Abu al-Hakam.” Hisham went on, “Tell me, does the Son know everything that the Father does?” He answered, “Yes.” Hisham asked, “Tell me, does the Father know everything that is with the Son?” He answered, “Yes.” Hisham asked, “Tell me, does the Son have power over everything that the Father has power over?” He answered, “Yes.” Hisham asked, “Tell me, does the Father have power over everything which the Son has power over?” He answered, “Yes.” \u003Cbr\u003EHisham responded, “Then how can one of them be the Son of his partner, while they are both equal, and how does each one of them oppress his partner?” Burayhah said; “There is no oppression between them.” Hisham continued, “The truth between them is that the Son is the Father of the Father, and the Father is the Son of the Son. Spend the night thinking about this, O Burayhah.” The Christians dispersed, and they were wishing that they had never seen Hisham and his friends. \u003Cbr\u003EYunus ibn `Abd al-Rahman says: Burayhah returned in grief and anxiety till he reached his home. The woman that served him asked him, “Why is it that I see you grieved and anxious!” Hence, he related to her the debate between Hisham and him. She asked, “Woe unto you! Do you want to follow truth or falsehood?” Burayhah replied, “Truth, of course.” She said to him, “Wherever you find truth, then turn to it. Be careful of obstinacy. For verily, obstinacy is doubt, doubt is calamity, and those with doubt are in Hell.” The reporter says: He agreed with her statement and decided to go to Hisham the next morning. \u003Cbr\u003EThe next morning he went to Hisham when none of his companions were with him. He enquired, “O Hisham! Do you have someone whose views and words you turn to, and profess his obedience?” Hisham answered, “Yes, O Burayhah.” “What is his description?” “Are you asking about his lineage or his religion?” Hisham replied, He said: ”Both of them, the description of his lineage and his religion.” Hisham responded, As for his lineage, it is the best of the lineages: He is the leader of the Arabs, the best of the Quraysh, and the most distinguished of the Hashimites. Whoever argued about his lineage always found it to be better than his own, because the Quraysh are the best of the Arabs, and the Hashimites are the best of the Quraysh. And, as he is the best of the Hashimites, he is the most pious among them, and their master. He descends from the children of the master, who are better than all other children. He is the son of the master. \u003Cbr\u003EHe said: “Describe his religion.” Hisham said: “His law or description of body and his purity?” He said: “Describe his body and his purity/” Hisham described, He is infallible; thus, he does not sin. He is generous; hence, he does not act miserly. He is brave; so he does not act cowardly. He has been bestowed with knowledge; therefore, he does not act ignorantly. He is the Protector of the Religion, firm in what is made mandatory. He is from the Progeny of the Prophets (AS), and the Vessel of Prophetic Knowledge (AS). He pardons when he is angry. He is fair in times of oppression. He helps when pleased, and is just towards both friend and foe. He does not ask of deviation for his enemy and foes not prohibit benefiting his friends. He practices the Book and speaks wonders. He is one of the Purified Ones. He relates the words of the Divinely Elected Leaders without violating their Proof. He is not ignorant of any question. He can derive a ruling [fatwa] from any tradition, and makes clear all darkness. \u003Cbr\u003EBurayhah responded, “You have described the Messiah in his attributes, and proved him by his proofs and signs, except that you have applied this description to another person. If there is a person who fits this description, we will believe in him.” Hisham said: “If you believe you will be guided, and if you follow the truth you will not be blamed.” He then added, “O Burayhah! There is not a proof which Allah establishes over the first of His Creation, except that He establishes it over the middle creation and the last creation. Therefore, Proofs do not become invalidated, just like nations and practices do not disappear.” Burayhah admitted, “How close is this to righteousness, and how near it is to the truth. This is the attribute of the wise. They establish proof that negates suspicion.” Hisham said: “Yes.” \u003Cbr\u003EThen they both departed together until they arrived at Medina. The woman was with them. They both wanted to see Abu `Abd Allah (AS). However, they met Musa ibn Ja`far (AS), so Hisham related to him the account. When he finished, Musa ibn Ja`far (AS) said: “O Burayhah! How is your knowledge of your Book (the Bible)?” He answered, “I am knowledgeable of it.” The Imam (AS) asked, “How is your faith in its interpretation?” He replied. “I am confident that I am knowledgeable about it.” The reported says: Musa ibn Ja`far (AS) began reading the Bible. Burayhah responded, “The Messiah must have read like this, and no one has read this recitation but the Messiah.” Burayhah then said: “I have been seeking you or someone like you for the past fifty years.” \u003Cbr\u003EThe reporter says: Therefore, he embraced Islam and so did the woman, and both were expediently faithful. The Hisham, Burayhah, and the woman entered the presence of Abu `Abd Allah (AS). Hisham related the account and the discussion that took place between Musa (AS) and Burayhah. Thus Abu `Abdillah (AS) read: Offspring one of the other; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing. So Burayhah asked, “May I be your ransom! How do you view the Torah, the Bible and the Books of the Prophets?” Abu `Abdillah (AS) replied: “We are their Heirs. We read them the way they were originally read, and we convey them as they were originally conveyed. Verily, Allah does not place a Proof [hujjat] on His earth who, when questioned about something, answers: `I do not know.’” \u003Cbr\u003EHence, Burayhah remained with Abu `Abdillah (AS) until Abu `Abdillah passed away. Then he remained with Musa ibn Ja`far (AS) until Burayhah died in his time. The Imam (AS) washed his corpse with his own hands, shrouded his body, and placed him in the grave and said: “This is a disciple from the disciples of the Messiah, who recognized the right of Allah over him.” The reported says: Thus, most of the Companions of the Imam (AS) wished they were like him.",
    "arabicText": "1 - أبي رحمه الله، قال: حدثنا أحمد بن إدريس ومحمد بن يحيى العطار، عن محمد بن أحمد، عن إبراهيم بن هاشم، عن محمد بن حماد، عن الحسن بن إبراهيم، عن يونس بن عبد الرحمن، عن هشام بن الحكم، عن جاثليق من جثالقة النصارى يقال له: بريهة، قد مكث جاثليق النصرانية سبعين سنة  وكان يطلب الإسلام و يطلب من يحتج عليه ممن يقرء كتبه ويعرف المسيح بصفاته ودلائله وآياته، قال: وعرف بذلك حتى اشتهر في النصارى والمسلمين واليهود والمجوس حتى افتخرت به النصارى وقالت: لو لم يكن في دين النصرانية إلا بريهة لأجزأنا، وكان طالبا للحق والإسلام مع ذلك  وكانت معه امرأة تخدمه، طال مكثها معه، وكان يسر إليها ضعف النصرانية وضعف حجتها، قال: فعرفت ذلك منه، فضرب بريهة الأمر ظهرا لبطن وأقبل يسأل فرق المسلمين والمختلفين في الإسلام من أعلمكم؟ وأقبل يسأل عن أئمة المسلمين وعن صلحائهم وعلمائهم، وأهل الحجى منهم، وكان يستقرئ فرقة فرقة لا يجد عند القوم شيئا، وقال: لو كانت أئمتكم أئمة على الحق لكان عندكم بعض الحق، فوصفت له الشيعة، ووصف له هشام بن الحكم. فقال يونس بن عبد الرحمن: فقال لي هشام: بينما أنا على دكاني على باب الكرخ جالس وعندي قوم يقرؤون علي القرآن فإذا أنا بفوج النصارى معه ما بين القسيسين إلى غيرهم نحو من مائة رجل عليهم السواد والبرانس، والجاثليق الأكبر فيهم بريهة حتى نزلوا حول دكاني  وجعل لبريهة كرسي يجلس عليه فقامت الأساقفة والرهابنة على عصيهم، وعلى رؤوسهم برانسهم، فقال بريهة: ما بقي من المسلمين أحد ممن يذكر بالعلم بالكلام إلا وقد ناظرته في النصرانية فما عندهم شئ وقد جئت أناظرك في الإسلام، قال: فضحك هشام فقال: يا بريهة إن كنت تريد مني آيات كآيات المسيح فليس أنا بالمسيح ولا مثله ولا أدانيه، ذاك روح طيبة خميصة  مرتفعة، آياته ظاهرة، وعلاماته قائمة، قال بريهة: فأعجبني الكلام والوصف. قال هشام: إن أردت الحجاج فههنا، قال بريهة: نعم فإني أسألك ما نسبة نبيكم هذا من المسيح نسبة الأبدان؟ قال هشام: ابن عم جده (لأمه) لأنه من ولد إسحاق ومحمد من ولد إسماعيل، قال بريهة، وكيف تنسبه إلى أبيه؟  قال هشام: إن أردت نسبه عندكم أخبرتك، وإن أردت نسبه عندنا أخبرتك، قال بريهة: أريد نسبه عندنا، وظننت أنه إذا نسبه نسبتنا أغلبه، قلت: فانسبه بالنسبة التي ننسبه بها، قال هشام: نعم، تقولون: إنه قديم من قديم  فأيهما الأب وأيهما الابن قال بريهة: الذي نزل إلى الأرض الابن، قال هشام: الذي نزل إلى الأرض الأب قال بريهة: الابن رسول الأب، قال هشام: إن الأب أحكم من الابن لأن الخلق خلق الأب، قال بريهة: إن الخلق خلق الأب وخلق الابن، قال هشام: ما منعهما أن ينزلا جميعا كما خلقا إذا اشتركا؟! قال بريهة: كيف يشتركان وهما شئ واحد إنما يفترقان بالاسم، قال هشام: إنما يجتمعان بالاسم، قال بريهة: جهل هذا الكلام، قال هشام: عرف هذا الكلام، قال بريهة: إن الابن متصل بالأب، قال هشام: إن الابن منفصل من الأب، قال بريهة: هذا خلاف ما يعقله الناس، قال هشام: إن كان ما يعقله الناس شاهدا لنا وعلينا فقد غلبتك لأن الأب كان ولم يكن الابن فتقول: هكذا يا بريهة؟ قال: ما أقول: هكذا، قال: فلم استشهدت قوما لا تقبل شهادتهم لنفسك، قال بريهة: إن الأب اسم والابن اسم يقدر به القديم  قال هشام: الاسمان قديمان كقدم الأب والابن؟ قال بريهة: لا ولكن الأسماء محدثة قال: فقد جعلت الأب ابنا والابن أبا، إن كان الابن أحدث هذه الأسماء دون الأب فهو الأب، وإن كان الأب أحدث هذه الأسماء دون الابن فهو الأب والابن أب وليس ههنا ابن  قال بريهة: إن الابن اسم للروح حين نزلت إلى الأرض، قال هشام: فحين لم تنزل إلى الأرض فاسمها ما هو؟ قال بريهة: فاسمها ابن نزلت أو لم تنزل: قال هشام: فقبل النزول هذه الروح كلها واحدة واسمها اثنان، قال بريهة: هي كلها واحدة روح واحدة، قال: قد رضيت أن تجعل بعضها ابنا وبعضها أبا، قال بريهة: لا لأن اسم الأب واسم الابن واحد، قال هشام: فالابن أبو الأب، والأب أبو الابن، والابن واحد، قالت الأساقفة بلسانها لبريهة: ما مر بك مثل ذا قط تقوم، فتحير بريهة وذهب ليقوم فتعلق به هشام، قال: ما يمنعك من الإسلام؟ أفي قلبك حزازة؟ فقلها وإلا سألتك عن النصرانية مسألة واحدة تبيت عليها ليلك هذا فتصبح وليس لك همة غيري، قالت الأساقفة: لا ترد هذه المسألة لعلها تشككك قال بريهة: قلها يا أبا الحكم. قال هشام: أفرأيتك الابن يعلم ما عند الأب؟ قال: نعم، قال: أفرأيتك الأب يعلم كل ما عند الابن؟ قال: نعم، قال: أفرأيتك تخبر عن الابن أيقدر على حمل كل ما يقدر عليه الأب؟ قال: نعم، قال: أفرأيتك تخبر عن الأب أيقدر على كل ما يقدر عليه الابن؟ قال: نعم، قال هشام: فكيف يكون واحد منهما ابن صاحبه وهما متساويان وكيف يظلم كل واحد منهما صاحبه؟ قال بريهة: ليس منهما ظلم، قال هشام: من الحق بينهما أن يكون الابن أب الأب والأب ابن الابن، بت عليها يا بريهة، وافترق النصارى وهم يتمنون أن لا يكونوا رأوا هشاما ولا أصحابه. قال: فرجع بريهة مغتما مهتما حتى صار إلى منزله فقالت امرأته التي تخدمه: ما لي أراك مهتما مغتما. فحكى لها الكلام الذي كان بينه وبين هشام، فقالت لبريهة: ويحك أتريد أن تكون على حق أو على باطل؟! فقال بريهة: بل على الحق، فقالت له: أينما وجدت الحق فمل إليه، وإياك واللجاجة فإن اللجاجة شك والشك شؤم وأهله في النار، قال: فصوب قولها وعزم على الغدو على هشام. قال: فغدا عليه وليس معه أحد من أصحابه، فقال: يا هشام ألك من تصدر عن رأيه وترجع إلى قوله وتدين بطاعته؟ قال هشام: نعم يا بريهة، قال: وما صفته؟ قال هشام: في نسبه أو في دينه؟ قال: فيهما جميعا صفة نسبه وصفة دينه، قال هشام: أما النسب خير الأنساب : رأس العرب وصفوة قريش وفاضل بني هاشم كل من نازعه في نسبه وجده أفضل منه لأن قريشا أفضل العرب وبني هاشم أفضل قريش، وأفضل بني هاشم خاصهم ودينهم وسيدهم، وكذلك ولد السيد أفضل من ولد غيره وهذا من ولد السيد، قال: فصف دينه، قال هشام: شرائعه أو صفة بدنه وطهارته؟ قال: صفة بدنه وطهارته، قال هشام: معصوم فلا يعصي، و سخي فلا يبخل، شجاع فلا يجبن، وما استودع من العلم فلا يجهل، حافظ للدين قائم بما فرض عليه، من عترة الأنبياء، وجامع علم الأنبياء، يحلم عند الغضب، وينصف عند الظلم، ويعين عند الرضا، وينصف من الولي والعدو، ولا يسأل شططا في عدوه  ولا يمنع إفادة وليه، يعمل بالكتاب ويحدث بالأعجوبات، من أهل الطهارات، يحكي قول الأئمة الأصفياء، لم تنقض له حجة، ولم يجهل مسألة، يفتي في كل سنة، ويجلو كل مدلهمة. قال بريهة: وصفت المسيح في صفاته وأثبته بحججه وآياته، إلا أن الشخص بائن عن شخصه والوصف قائم بوصفه، فإن يصدق الوصف نؤمن بالشخص، قال هشام: إن تؤمن ترشد وإن تتبع الحق لا تؤنب. ثم قال هشام: يا بريهة ما من حجة أقامها الله على أول خلقه إلا أقامها على وسط خلقه وآخر خلقه فلا تبطل الحجج، ولا تذهب الملل، ولا تذهب السنن. قال بريهة: ما أشبه هذا بالحق وأقربه من الصدق، وهذه صفة الحكماء يقيمون من الحجة ما ينفون به الشبهة، قال هشام: نعم، فارتحلا حتى أتيا المدينة والمرأة معهما وهما يريدان أبا عبد الله عليه السلام فلقيا موسى بن جعفر عليهما السلام، فحكى له هشام الحكاية، فلما فرغ قال موسى بن جعفر عليهما السلام،: يا بريهة كيف علمك بكتابك؟ قال: أنا به عالم، قال: كيف ثقتك بتأويله؟ قال: ما أوثقني بعلمي فيه (١) قال: فابتدأ موسى بن جعفر عليهما السلام، بقراءة الإنجيل، قال بريهة: والمسيح لقد كان يقرء هكذا وما قرأ هذه القراءة إلا المسيح، ثم قال بريهة: إياك كنت أطلب منذ خمسين سنة أو مثلك، قال: فآمن وحسن إيمانه وآمنت المرأة وحسن إيمانها. قال: فدخل هشام وبريهة والمرأة على أبي عبد الله عليه السلام، وحكى هشام الحكاية والكلام الذي جرى بين موسى عليه السلام وبريهة، فقال أبو عبد الله عليه السلام: ﴿ذرية بعضها من بعض والله سميع عليم﴾  فقال بريهة: جعلت فداك أنى لكم التوراة والإنجيل وكتب الأنبياء؟ قال: هي عندنا وراثة من عندهم نقرؤها كما قرؤوها ونقولها كما قالوها، إن الله لا يجعل حجة في أرضه يسأل عن شئ فيقول: لا أدري فلزم بريهة أبا عبد الله عليه السلام حتى مات أبو عبد الله عليه السلام، ثم لزم موسى بن جعفر عليهما السلام، حتى مات في زمانه فغسله بيده وكفنه بيده ولحده بيده، وقال: هذا حواري من حواريي المسيح يعرف حق الله عليه، قال: فتمنى أكثر أصحابه أن يكونوا مثله.  باب ذكر عظمة الله جل جلاله  ",

My father said: Ahmad ibn Idris and Muhammad ibn Yahya al-`Attar said, on the authority of‬‬ ‫‪Muhammad ibn Ahmad, on the authority of Ibrahim ibn Hashim, on the authority of‬‬ ‫‪Muhammad ibn Hammad, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Ibrahim, on the authority of Yunus‬‬ ‫‪ibn `Abd al-Rahman, that‬‬ ",
    "thaqalaynMatn": "Hisham ibn al-Hakam related the story of the Catholicos, primate of the Armenian church of the Christians, who was named Burayhah, and had been the Catholicos for seventy years. He used to research Islam, and sought to debate those Muslims who were familiar with the Christian gospels, and who were familiar with the Messiah, his attributes, arguments, and signs. \u003Cbr\u003EHe says: He had been known for that until he became famous among the Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Zoroastrians. The Christians use to be so proud of him that they would say: “If there was no one on earth in the Christian faith except Burayhah that would suffice us.” He was seeker of the truth and with that, of Islam. He had a woman with him that used to serve him and she had been with him for a long time. He use to secretly tell her about the weakness of Christianity and its weak proofs. He said: I came to know that from him. Thus, Burayhah put this matter behind him, and approached the various Muslim schools who differed a bout Islam, in search of the most learned one among them. He came asking about the Muslim leaders, their pious one, their scholars, and t heir leading intellectuals. He examined every Muslim school of though, and found nothing that satisfied him. He said: “If you leaders were on the true path, then they would have some truth with them!” \u003Cbr\u003EFinally, he learned about the Shi`ites from Hisham ibn al-Hakam. Yunus ibn `Abd al-Rahman says: Hisham said to me. I was sitting in my shop at the door of al-Karkh while a group of people were reciting the Qur’an to me. I was suddenly taken aback by a group of Christian clergymen. There were approximately one hundred men, dressed in the black clothing and chasubles (of the Coptic priests) and the Great Catholicos. Burayhah was among them. They came down around my shop and placed a chair for Burayhah to sit on. The bishops and monks stood learning over their staffs, and on their heads were their chasubles. Burayhah addressed me and said: “I have exhausted every single Muslim theologian in debate regarding Christianity, and they had nothing that impressed me. Hence, I have come to you wishing to debate Islam.” He says: Hisham laughed and said: “O Burayhah! If you expect me to give you the same type of signs that he Messiah gave, you have come to the wrong place as I am not the Messiah, not even close. I would never critics him, though, as he was one of the purified ones, who was humble in character, yet sublime in spirituality. The Signs of Allah wee manifest in him.” \u003Cbr\u003EBurayhah responded, “Your words astonish me.” Hisham said: “If you want to argue then go ahead.” Burayhah said: “Yes. I certainly want to question you: What is the physical tie between your Prophet and the Messiah?’ Hisham replied, “He is the son of his maternal grandfather, because Jesus is from the children of Ishaq, and Muhammad (SA) is from the children of Isma`il.” Burayhah asked, How do you relate him to his father?” Hisham answered, “If you want his lineage from your view, I will inform you of it, and if yo want his linage according to us, I will inform you of that.” Burayhah enquired, “I want his lineage according to us.” Burayhah says that I was thinking that if he described his lineage according to us, I would overpower him. So I said: “Describe his lineage the way we relate it.” Hisham explained, “Yes. You say: “He is without beginning from the one without beginning. Then who is the Father and who is the Son?” Burayhah said: “He who came unto the Earth is the Son.” Hisham asked, “He who came unto the Earth is the Father.” He said: “The Son is the messenger of the Father.” Hisham added, “Verily, the Father is wiser than the Son, because the Father is the Creator.” Burayhah said: “Verily, the Father and the Son are both the Creators.” Hisham continued, “What prevented them from coming down to Earth together like they were together when they created the world?” Burayhah replied, “How do they associate while they are both one thing? They differ only by name.” Hisham responded, “Verily, they unite with the name.” Burayhah said: “This statement is unknown.” Hisham said: “This statement is well-known,” Burayhah responded, “Verily, the Son is connected to the Father.” Hisham replied, “Verily, the Son is disconnected from the Father.” He replied, “This is contrary to what the people would think.” \u003Cbr\u003EHisham explained, “If what the people think is true, then I have overcome you for the Father was when the Son was not. Is that what you are saying, O Burayhah?” He answered, “I do not say this.” Hisham responded, “Then why did you seek to confirm your beliefs on the beliefs of those whom you reject?” He said: “Verily, the Father is a name and the Son is a name, and the eternal has decreed them.” Hisham said: “Are the two names without beginning? Are they eternal like the Father and the Son? Burayhah declared, “No, The names are originated.” He responded, “You have certainly made the Father a Son, and the Son a Father. If the Son brought these names about, and not the Father, then he is the Father. And if the Father brought these names about, and not the Son, then he is the Father, and the Son is the Father. Thus, there is no Son here.” Burayhah said: “Verily, the Son is a name of the Holy Spirit when it came down to the Earth.” Hisham responded, “What was its name prior to coming down to Earth?” Burayhah continued on, baffled: “Its name is the Son whether it came down or did not came down.” Hisham advocated, “So before the coming down of this Spirit, it was all one but it had two names.” He said: “It is all one; one Spirit.” Hisham acclaimed, “You are pleased to make some of it the Son and some of it the Father.” Burayhah replied, “No, because the name of the Father and the name of the Son are one.” Hisham said: “Therefore, the Son is the Father of the Father, and the Father is Father of the Son, and there is one Son.” \u003Cbr\u003EThe bishops said to Burayhah with one voice: “Nothing like this has ever happened to you, stand up!” Thus, Burayhah was confused and wanted to leave, so Hisham attached and said: What prevents you from embracing Islam? Is there any rancour in your heart? Then say it, otherwise I will ask you a question about Christianity. I will give you the night to think about it. Then, when you wake up, you will only be interested in me. The bishops said: “Do not ask him the question, for it may create doubts about your faith.” Burayhah said: “Say it, O Abu al-Hakam.” Hisham went on, “Tell me, does the Son know everything that the Father does?” He answered, “Yes.” Hisham asked, “Tell me, does the Father know everything that is with the Son?” He answered, “Yes.” Hisham asked, “Tell me, does the Son have power over everything that the Father has power over?” He answered, “Yes.” Hisham asked, “Tell me, does the Father have power over everything which the Son has power over?” He answered, “Yes.” \u003Cbr\u003EHisham responded, “Then how can one of them be the Son of his partner, while they are both equal, and how does each one of them oppress his partner?” Burayhah said; “There is no oppression between them.” Hisham continued, “The truth between them is that the Son is the Father of the Father, and the Father is the Son of the Son. Spend the night thinking about this, O Burayhah.” The Christians dispersed, and they were wishing that they had never seen Hisham and his friends. \u003Cbr\u003EYunus ibn `Abd al-Rahman says: Burayhah returned in grief and anxiety till he reached his home. The woman that served him asked him, “Why is it that I see you grieved and anxious!” Hence, he related to her the debate between Hisham and him. She asked, “Woe unto you! Do you want to follow truth or falsehood?” Burayhah replied, “Truth, of course.” She said to him, “Wherever you find truth, then turn to it. Be careful of obstinacy. For verily, obstinacy is doubt, doubt is calamity, and those with doubt are in Hell.” The reporter says: He agreed with her statement and decided to go to Hisham the next morning. \u003Cbr\u003EThe next morning he went to Hisham when none of his companions were with him. He enquired, “O Hisham! Do you have someone whose views and words you turn to, and profess his obedience?” Hisham answered, “Yes, O Burayhah.” “What is his description?” “Are you asking about his lineage or his religion?” Hisham replied, He said: ”Both of them, the description of his lineage and his religion.” Hisham responded, As for his lineage, it is the best of the lineages: He is the leader of the Arabs, the best of the Quraysh, and the most distinguished of the Hashimites. Whoever argued about his lineage always found it to be better than his own, because the Quraysh are the best of the Arabs, and the Hashimites are the best of the Quraysh. And, as he is the best of the Hashimites, he is the most pious among them, and their master. He descends from the children of the master, who are better than all other children. He is the son of the master. \u003Cbr\u003EHe said: “Describe his religion.” Hisham said: “His law or description of body and his purity?” He said: “Describe his body and his purity/” Hisham described, He is infallible; thus, he does not sin. He is generous; hence, he does not act miserly. He is brave; so he does not act cowardly. He has been bestowed with knowledge; therefore, he does not act ignorantly. He is the Protector of the Religion, firm in what is made mandatory. He is from the Progeny of the Prophets (AS), and the Vessel of Prophetic Knowledge (AS). He pardons when he is angry. He is fair in times of oppression. He helps when pleased, and is just towards both friend and foe. He does not ask of deviation for his enemy and foes not prohibit benefiting his friends. He practices the Book and speaks wonders. He is one of the Purified Ones. He relates the words of the Divinely Elected Leaders without violating their Proof. He is not ignorant of any question. He can derive a ruling [fatwa] from any tradition, and makes clear all darkness. \u003Cbr\u003EBurayhah responded, “You have described the Messiah in his attributes, and proved him by his proofs and signs, except that you have applied this description to another person. If there is a person who fits this description, we will believe in him.” Hisham said: “If you believe you will be guided, and if you follow the truth you will not be blamed.” He then added, “O Burayhah! There is not a proof which Allah establishes over the first of His Creation, except that He establishes it over the middle creation and the last creation. Therefore, Proofs do not become invalidated, just like nations and practices do not disappear.” Burayhah admitted, “How close is this to righteousness, and how near it is to the truth. This is the attribute of the wise. They establish proof that negates suspicion.” Hisham said: “Yes.” \u003Cbr\u003EThen they both departed together until they arrived at Medina. The woman was with them. They both wanted to see Abu `Abd Allah (AS). However, they met Musa ibn Ja`far (AS), so Hisham related to him the account. When he finished, Musa ibn Ja`far (AS) said: “O Burayhah! How is your knowledge of your Book (the Bible)?” He answered, “I am knowledgeable of it.” The Imam (AS) asked, “How is your faith in its interpretation?” He replied. “I am confident that I am knowledgeable about it.” The reported says: Musa ibn Ja`far (AS) began reading the Bible. Burayhah responded, “The Messiah must have read like this, and no one has read this recitation but the Messiah.” Burayhah then said: “I have been seeking you or someone like you for the past fifty years.” \u003Cbr\u003EThe reporter says: Therefore, he embraced Islam and so did the woman, and both were expediently faithful. The Hisham, Burayhah, and the woman entered the presence of Abu `Abd Allah (AS). Hisham related the account and the discussion that took place between Musa (AS) and Burayhah. Thus Abu `Abdillah (AS) read: Offspring one of the other; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing. So Burayhah asked, “May I be your ransom! How do you view the Torah, the Bible and the Books of the Prophets?” Abu `Abdillah (AS) replied: “We are their Heirs. We read them the way they were originally read, and we convey them as they were originally conveyed. Verily, Allah does not place a Proof [hujjat] on His earth who, when questioned about something, answers: `I do not know.’” \u003Cbr\u003EHence, Burayhah remained with Abu `Abdillah (AS) until Abu `Abdillah passed away. Then he remained with Musa ibn Ja`far (AS) until Burayhah died in his time. The Imam (AS) washed his corpse with his own hands, shrouded his body, and placed him in the grave and said: “This is a disciple from the disciples of the Messiah, who recognized the right of Allah over him.” The reported says: Thus, most of the Companions of the Imam (AS) wished they were like him.",
