<p style="text-align: right;">[ 21397 ] 42 – الشيخ عبد النبي الكاظمي في تكملة الرجال: نقلا عن خط المجلسي رحمه الله، قال: اقول: وجدت نسخة قديمة من كتاب سليم بروايتين بينهما اختلاف يسير، وكتب في آخر احداهما: تم كتاب سليم بن قيس الهلالي – إلى أن قال – روي عن الصادق (عليه السلام)، أنه قال: ” من لم يكن عنده من شيعتنا ومحبينا كتاب سليم بن قيس الهلالي، فليس عنده من أمرنا شئ، ولا يعلم من أسبابنا شيئا، وهو أبجد الشيعة، وسر من اسرار آل محمد (عليهم السلام) “.</p>
<p>The Sheykh Abdul Naby Al Kazmy in <em>Takmalat Al Rijaal</em> said, ‘I copied from the writing of Al Majlisi, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy upon him, who said, ‘I say that I found an old copy of Kitab Sulaym by two reports between which were simple differences, and written at the end of one of them was, “This completes Kitab Sulaym Bin Qays Al Hilali – until it said – A report from Al Sadiq<sup>-asws</sup>, that he<sup>-asws</sup> said: <strong>‘The ones from our<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites and those that loves us<sup>-asws</sup>, who does not have Kitab Sulaym Bin Qays Al-Hilali, then there is nothing with him from our<sup>-asws</sup> matters, nor does he know anything from our<sup>-asws</sup> reasons, and it is the Alphabet (<em>Abjad</em>) of the Shiites, and a secret from the secrets of the Progeny<sup>-asws</sup> of Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup>’.</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="preface" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc341095336"></a>Preface</h2>
<p>Sulaym ibn Qays Kufi Amari Hilali<sup>-ra</sup> is ‘Tabai’<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> and has seen the lifetime of five Masoom Imams<sup>-asws</sup>, including Imam Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, Imam Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, Imam Hussain<sup>-asws</sup>, Imam Zainul Abadeen<sup>-asws</sup> and Imam Mohammed Baqir<sup>-asws</sup>.&nbsp; Sulaym has written those accounts in his priceless book, which he has either observed by his own eyes or has directly heard from those who have directly heard from the Divine tongues of the Prophet Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup> or Amir-ul-Momineen Ali<sup>-asws</sup> ibn abi Talib<sup>-asws</sup>.&nbsp; The date of birth of Sulaym ibn Qays can be estimated from the history somewhere during the early years after migration of the Holy Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> to Medina and his demise is believed to have taken place somewhere between 70 to 90 Hijri<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.&nbsp; Most of the Shia scholars have agreed that his book is the first Shia Ahadith book compiled even before the famous Shia book, consisting of the sermons and Ahadith narrated by Imam Zain-ul-Abadeen<sup>-asws</sup> ‘Sahifa-e-Kamila’.</p>
<p>Ibn Nadeem has included in his book when commenting about the scholars and Ahadith contributors that Sulaym ibn Qays Hilali was among the devout companions of Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>.&nbsp; He escaped persecution of Hajjaj ibn Yousif and took refuge with Abaan ibn abi Ayash.&nbsp; Hajjaj wanted to arrest and kill Sulaym Ibn Qays, so Abaan offered him shelter in recognition of him being a companion of Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>.&nbsp; When Sulaym ibn Qays was inspired about his death, he told Abaan, O the son of my brother, I am about to leave this world, as Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> has informed me so.&nbsp; After having said that Sulaym entrusted to Abaan his book (as it is in your hands today). It’s a famous book of Sulaym, which does not give reference to any other book but directly narrates from Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> and his<sup>-asws</sup> pious companions.</p>
<h2 id="dream-of-aban-ra" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc341095337"></a>Dream of Aban<sup>-ra</sup>:</h2>
<p>Ummar ibn Azina says, once Abaan ibn abi Ayash called for me and when I turned up he narrated to me the following: ‘I have been informed in my dream that I will soon be leaving this world, so I am very pleased to see you, last night Sulaym ibn Qays came into my dream, and said, O Abaan! You are about to exit this mortal world, fear Allah about the my work (book) which I have entrusted to you and do not waste it, fulfil your promise of keeping it hidden from the others but passing it onto the shias of Amir-ul-momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, the shia which you entrust this book with should be pious and from good linage.&nbsp; Abaan then continued telling me about Sulaym ibn Qays, that when Hajjaj came to Iraq, he started enquiring about Sulaym ibn Qays, as he had a burning desire of killing him.&nbsp; Sulaym after finding it out slipped away from there and discreetly came to us in Nobandjan and resided with us at my house.&nbsp; Abaan says I have not seen anyone more devout and knowledgeable, fearing Allah, disliking fame; I was, at that time, only fourteen years of age.</p>
<p>I learnt the Holy Quran from Sulaym and I used to ask him about various religious matters and he would narrate to me the Ahadith from the companions of the warriors of ‘Badr’. He narrated to me Ahadith from Salama ibn Umme Salama<sup>sa</sup> the wife of the Holy Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, Muaz ibn Jabal, Salman Farasi, Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, Abu Dharr, Miqdad, Ammar and Bara ibn Azab.&nbsp; He then put those Ahadith away without taking any commitment from me but then near his death time, he called me and said:</p>
<p>O Abaan! I have stayed with you, and have not seen those things in you, which I really abhor. I have a book containing Ahadith which I have heard from most trustworthy narrators and I have written those down with my own hand, I do not want to reveal those Ahadith to the public as they will find those extremely strange and refute them, although those are just, I have directly heard those from just and pious ones, including Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, Salman Farsi<sup>-ra</sup>, Abu Dharr Ghafari<sup>-ra</sup>, Miqdad ibn Aswad<sup>-ra</sup>.&nbsp; There is not a single Hadith in this compilation, which I after listening from one, has not ratified from the other one. All of them have agreed with those accounts.&nbsp; When I got ill I thought about destroying them but then I abhor that idea and instead will like you to safeguard my work, do not reveal it to anyone but after my death and only to the one whom you find trustworthy, reliable and is a staunch Shia of Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup>.&nbsp; Upon accepting these conditions of Sulaym, he gave me his book, and read all of it to me, he then passed away.&nbsp; After his death, I read his book again and found it very strange and difficult as it clearly showed destruction, in the Hereafter, of all nation of the Prophet Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup> except for the followers of Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, whether they might be among the Mahajr<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, Ansaar<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> or the Tabaie<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</p>

<p><strong><u>كيف تعرف ابن أذينة على أبان</u></strong><strong>؟</strong></p>
<p>قال عمر بن أذينة: دعاني أبان بن أبي عياش قبل موته بنحو شهر فقال لي: رأيت البارحة رؤيا، أني خليق أن أموت سريعا. إني رأيتك الغداة ففرحت بك. إني رأيت الليلة سليم بن قيس الهلالي فقال لي: (يا أبان، إنك ميت في أيامك هذه. فاتق الله في وديعتي ولا تضيعها، وف لي بما ضمنت من كتمانها. ولا تضعها إلا عند رجل من شيعة علي بن أبي طالب صلوات الله عليه له دين وحسب). فلما بصرت بك الغداة فرحت برؤيتك وذكرت رؤياي سليم بن قيس.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-ibn-azina-come-to-know-abaan" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc341095339"></a>How did Ibn Azina come to know Abaan</h2>
<p>Umar Bin Azina said, ‘Abaan Bin Ayyash called me approximately one month before he died. He said to me, ‘I saw a dream last night that I will soon die. I saw you this morning and happy with you. I saw Sulaym Bin Qays last night (in the dream), he said to me, ‘O Abaan, You will soon be dead during these days, so fear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> with regard to my trust (this book) and do not let it go to waste, and be faithful to me with what responsibility I gave you for concealing it. And do not display it except in the presence of a man from the Shiites of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> who is reputable in his religion’. When I saw you today, I was happy to see you, and I mentioned to you the dream of Sulaym Bin Qays’.</p>
<p><strong><u>كيف تعرف أبان على سليم؟</u></strong></p>
<p>لما قدم الحجاج العراق سأل عن سليم بن قيس، فهرب منه فوقع إلينا بالنوبندجان متواريا، فنزل معنا في الدار. فلم أر رجلا كان أشد إجلالا لنفسه ولا أشد اجتهادا ولا أطول حزنا منه، ولا أشد خمولا لنفسه ولا أشد بغضا لشهرة نفسه منه. وأنا يومئذ ابن أربع عشرة سنة، وقد قرأت القرآن، وكنت أسأله فيحدثني عن أهل بدر. فسمعت منه أحاديث كثيرة عن عمر بن أبي سلمة ابن أم سلمة زوجة النبي صلى الله عليه وآله، وعن معاذ بن جبل وعن سلمان الفارسي وعن علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام وأبي ذر والمقداد وعمار والبراء بن عازب. ثم استكتمنيها ولم يأخذ علي فيها يمينا.</p>
<p>When Al-Hajjaj came to Al Iraq, he asked about Sulaym Bin Qays. He fled from him, and came to us at Al-Nowbandajaan. He stayed with us at the house. I have never seen a man more intense in his reputation, nor more intense in his diligence, nor lengthier in his grief, nor more intense in being in isolation, nor more intense in abhorring publicity for himself, than him. And I was of fourteen years of age in those days, and had read the Quran, and I used to ask him, so he narrated to me about the people of Badr. I heard numerous Hadith from him, from Umar bin Abu Salma, the son of Umm Salma<sup>-as</sup>, the wife of the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and from Ma’az Bin Jabal, and from Salman Al Farsy<sup>-as</sup>, and from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and from Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Ammar<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Bara’a Bin Aazib<sup>-ra</sup>. Then he told me to conceal these, but did not take an oath from me with my right hand.</p>
<p><strong><u>قراءة سليم كتابه على أبان وتسليمه إياه </u></strong></p>
<p>فلم ألبث أن حضرته الوفاة، فدعاني وخلا بي وقال: يا أبان، إني قد جاورتك فلم أر منك إلا ما أحب. وإن عندي كتبا سمعتها عن الثقات وكتبتها بيدي، فيها أحاديث لا أحب أن تظهر للناس، لأن الناس ينكرونها ويعظمونها. وهي حق أخذتها من أهل الحق والفقه والصدق والبر، عن علي بن أبي طالب صلوات الله عليه وسلمان الفارسي وأبي ذر الغفاري والمقداد بن الأسود رضي الله عنهم. وليس منها حديث أسمعه من أحدهم إلا سألت عنه الآخر حتى اجتمعوا عليه جميعا، فتبعتهم عليه، وأشياء بعد سمعتها من غيرهم من أهل الحق.</p>
<h2 id="sulaym-read-his-book-to-abaan-and-submitted-it-to-him" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc341095340"></a>Sulaym read his book to Abaan and submitted it to him</h2>
<p>It wasn’t long before, that death presented itself to him. He called me and was in seclusion with me, and said, ‘O Abaan, I have come close to you. I have not seen from you except what I like. And in my presence is a book of what I have heard from the reliable ones, and written it by my hand. In this are Hadith, which I would not like you to display to the people, because the people will deny these and will magnify them. And this is the truth, which I have taken from the people of the truth, and the understanding, and the sincerity, and the goodness – from Ali Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and Salman Al-Farsy<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr Al-Ghaffary<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad Bin Al-Aswad<sup>-ra</sup>. And there is no Hadith in it, which I have heard from one of them except that I asked about it to the other one until they all were in agreement with it. So I followed them, and there are things, which I heard afterwards from others, the people of the truth.</p>
<p>وإني هممت حين مرضت أن أحرقها، فتأثمت من ذلك وقطعت به. فإن جعلت لي عهد الله عز وجل وميثاقه أن لا تخبر بها أحدا ما دمت حيا، ولا تحدث بشيئ منها بعد موتي إلا من تثق به كثقتك بنفسك، وإن حدث بك حدث أن تدفعها إلى من تثق به من شيعة علي بن أبي طالب صلوات الله عليه ممن له دين وحسب. فضمنت ذلك له، فدفعها إلي وقرأها كلها علي. فلم يلبث سليم أن هلك، رحمه الله.</p>
<p>And I was considering burning it during my illness. I thought that to be a sin and cut myself off from it. Give me a promise of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic, and by Him<sup>-azwj</sup> you will not inform about it anyone as long as I am alive, nor will you narrate anything from it after my death except to the one as reliable as yourself. And if an event takes place whereby you have to hand it over, then give it to the reliable one from the Shiites of Ali<sup>ar</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> who is reputable in his religion’ So he read it all out to me and handed all of it over to me. It was not long before Sulaym passed away. May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on him.</p>
<p><strong><u>إقرار الحسن البصري بمحتوى كتاب سليم </u></strong></p>
<p>فنظرت فيها بعده فقطعت بها وأعظمتها واستصعبتها، لأن فيها هلاك جميع أمة محمد صلى الله عليه وآله من المهاجرين والأنصار والتابعين، غير علي بن أبي طالب وأهل بيته صلوات الله عليهم وشيعته.</p>
<h2 id="approval-of-al-hassan-al-basry-of-the-contents-of-the-book-of-sulaym" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc341095341"></a>Approval of Al-Hassan Al-Basry of the contents of the Book of Sulaym</h2>
<p>I looked into it afterwards, so I cut off by it, and magnified it, and found difficulties with it, because in it is the destruction of the whole of the community of Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup>, from the Emigrants, and the Helpers, and the Followers (Al-Tabioun), apart from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-asws</sup> Household, and his<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites.</p>
<p>فكان أول من لقيت بعد قدومي البصرة الحسن بن أبي الحسن البصري، وهو يومئذ متوار من الحجاج. والحسن يومئذ من شيعة علي بن أبي طالب صلوات الله عليه ومن مفرطيهم، نادم متلهف على ما فاته من نصرة علي عليه السلام والقتال معه يوم الجمل.</p>
<p>So, the first one I met when I proceeded to Basra was Al-Hassan Bin Abu Al-Hassan Al-Basry, and in those days he was one of those fleeing from Al-Hajjaj. And Al-Hassan in those days was one manifesting himself to be one of the Shiites of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and was remorseful and wanted to make up for not having helped Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and fought alongside him<sup>-asws</sup> in the battle of the Camel (Al-Jamal).</p>
<p>فخلوت به في شرقي دار أبي خليفة الحجاج بن أبي عتاب الديلمي، فعرضتها عليه، فبكى ثم قال: (ما في أحاديثه شيئ إلا حق، قد سمعته من الثقات من شيعة علي بن أبي طالب صلوات الله عليه وغيرهم .</p>
<p>So, I secluded myself with him in the eastern part of the house of Abu Khalifa Al-Hajjaj Bin Abu Otaab Al-Daylami. I presented it (the book) to him. He wept, then said, ‘There is no Hadith in it except that it is truth which I have heard from the reliable ones of the Shiites of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and others’.</p>
<p><strong><u>تقرير الإمام زين العابدين عليه السلام للكتاب</u></strong></p>
<p>قال أبان: فحججت من عامي ذلك فدخلت على علي بن الحسين عليه السلام، وعنده أبو الطفيل عامر بن واثلة صاحب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله – وكان من خيار أصحاب علي عليه السلام – ولقيت عنده عمر بن أبي سلمة ابن أم سلمة زوجة النبي صلى الله عليه وآله. فعرضته عليه وعلى أبي الطفيل وعلى علي بن الحسين عليه السلام ذلك أجمع ثلاثة أيام – كل يوم إلى الليل – ويغدو عليه عمر وعامر. فقرآه عليه ثلاثة أيام، فقال عليه السلام لي: (صدق سليم، رحمه الله، هذا حديثنا كله نعرفه).</p>
<h2 id="approval-of-the-imam-zayn-al-abideen-asws-for-the-book" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc341095342"></a>Approval of the Imam Zayn Al-Abideen<sup>-asws</sup> for the book</h2>
<p>Abaan said, ‘I went for Pilgrimage during that year. I came to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, and in his<sup>-asws</sup> presence was Abu Tufayl Aamir Bin Waasila, a companion of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> – and he was one of the good companions of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> – and I met in his<sup>-asws</sup> presence Umar Bin Abu Salma, son of Umm Salma<sup>-ra</sup>, wife of the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>. I presented it (this book) to him, and to Abu Tufayl, and to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> in that gathering for three days – every day until the night – Umar and Aamir came to him<sup>-asws</sup> as well. I read it out to him<sup>-asws</sup> for three days. He<sup>-asws</sup> said to me: ‘Sulaym has spoken the truth, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have mercy on him. These are our<sup>-asws</sup> Hadith, we<sup>-asws</sup> recognise all of them’.</p>
<p>وقال أبو الطفيل وعمر بن أبي سلمة: (ما فيه حديث إلا وقد سمعناه من علي صلوات الله عليه، ومن سلمان ومن أبي ذر ومن المقداد).</p>
<p>And so said Abu Al-Tufayl and Umar Bin Abu Salma, ‘There is nothing in it except that, which we have heard it from Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and from Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and from Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and from Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>.</p>
<p>فقلت لأبي الحسن علي بن الحسين عليه السلام: جعلت فداك، إنه ليضيق صدري ببعض ما فيه، لأن فيه هلاك أمة محمد صلى الله عليه وآله رأسا من المهاجرين والأنصار والتابعين، غيركم أهل البيت وشيعتكم. فقال عليه السلام: يا أخا عبد القيس، أما بلغك أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قال: (إن مثل أهل بيتي في أمتي كمثل سفينة نوح في قومه، من ركبها نجا ومن تخلف عنها غرق. وكمثل باب حطة في بني إسرائيل)؟ فقلت: نعم.</p>
<p>I said to Abu Al-Hassan Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘May I be sacrificed for you, some of this which is in it, has constricted my chest, because in it is the destruction of the community of Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup>, chiefs of the ‘Al-Mahajir’<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> and the ‘Al-Ansar’<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> and the Followers, except for you<sup>-asws</sup> the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household and your<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O brother of Abdul Qays, has it not reached to you that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said that: ‘The example of the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household in my<sup>-saww</sup> community is like the ark of Noah<sup>sa</sup> among his<sup>-as</sup> people. The one who embarks upon it is rescued, and the one who is left behind will drown. Like the Door of <em>Hitta</em> among the Children of Israel?’ I said, ‘Yes’.</p>
<p>قال: من حدثك؟ فقلت: قد سمعته من أكثر من مائة من الفقهاء. فقال: ممن؟ فقلت: سمعته من حنش بن المعتمر، وذكر أنه سمعه من أبي ذر وهو آخذ بحلقة باب الكعبة ينادي به نداء ويرويه عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فقال: وممن؟ فقلت: ومن الحسن بن أبي الحسن البصري أنه سمعه من أبي ذر ومن المقداد بن الأسود الكندي ومن علي بن أبي طالب صلوات الله عليه. فقال: وممن؟ فقلت: ومن سعيد بن المسيب وعلقمة بن قيس، ومن أبي ظبيان. الجنبي، ومن عبد الرحمن بن أبي ليلى – كل هؤلاء حاجين – أخبروا أنهم سمعوا من أبي ذر.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Who narrated to you?’ I said, ‘I have heard it from more than one hundred of the <em>Fuqaha</em>’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘From whom?’ I said, ‘I heard it from Hanash Bin Al-Mo’tamar, and he mentioned that he heard it from Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> who was grabbing the ring of the Door of the Kaabah, calling out (loudly), and he<sup>-ra</sup> was reporting from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘And from whom?’ I said, ‘And from Al-Hassan Bin Abu Al-Hassan Al-Basry. He heard it from Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> and from Al-Miqdad Bin Al-Aswad Al-Kindy<sup>-ra</sup>, and from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘And from whom?’ I said, ‘And from Saeed Bin Al-Musayyab, and Alqama Bin Qays, and from Abu Zibyaan Al-Janbiy, and from Abdul Rahmaan Bin Abu Layli – all of them were Pilgrims – they informed that they heard from Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>’.</p>
<p>وقال أبو الطفيل وعمر بن أبي سلمة: (ونحن والله سمعنا من أبي ذر، وسمعناه من علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام والمقداد وسلمان). ثم أقبل عمر بن أبي سلمة فقال: والله، لقد سمعته ممن هو خير من هؤلاء كلهم، سمعته من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، سمعته أذناي ووعاه قلبي. فأقبل علي علي بن الحسين عليه السلام فقال: أو ليس هذا الحديث وحده ينتظم جميع ما أفظعك وعظم في صدرك من تلك الأحاديث؟ اتق الله يا أخا عبد القيس، فإن وضح لك أمر فاقبله وإلا فاسكت تسلم ورد علمه إلى الله، فإنك في أوسع مما بين السماء والأرض. قال أبان: فعند ذلك سألته عما يسعني جهله وعما لا يسعني جهله، فأجابني بما أجابني.</p>
<p>And so said Abu Al-Tufayl and Umar Bin Abu Salma, ‘And we, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, heard from Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and we heard it from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Salman<sup>-ra</sup>’. Then Umar Bin Abu Salma said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I have heard it from the one who is better than all of them. I heard it from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. I heard it by my ears, and remembered it by my heart. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> addressed me. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Is this not one of the Hadith from all those that constricted you and created (a burden) on your chest? Fear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, O brother of Abdul Qays, for if its matter is clear to you, then accept it otherwise observe silence, submit and refer its knowledge to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, for you there is leeway with regards to this which is wider than what is between the sky and the earth’. Abaan said, ‘At that point, I asked him<sup>-asws</sup> about what I was ignorant of and what I was not ignorant of. He<sup>-asws</sup> answered me what he<sup>-asws</sup> answered me’.</p>
<p><strong><u>أبان وأبو الطفيل </u></strong></p>
<p>قال أبان: ثم لقيت أبا الطفيل بعد ذلك في منزله، فحدثني في الرجعة عن أناس من أهل بدر وعن سلمان وأبي ذر والمقداد وأبي بن كعب. وقال أبو الطفيل: فعرضت ذلك الذي سمعته منهم على علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام بالكوفة، فقال لي: (هذا علم خاص يسع الأمة جهله ورد علمه إلى الله تعالى). ثم صدقني بكل ما حدثوني فيها وقرأ علي بذلك قرآنا كثيرا وفسره تفسيرا شافيا، حتى صرت ما أنا بيوم القيامة بأشد يقينا مني بالرجعة.</p>

<p>Abaan said, ‘Then I met Abu Al-Tufayl after that at his house. He narrated to me regarding the Return (Al-Raj’at) about the people from the combatants of Badr, and from Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Bin Ka’ab. And Abu Al-Tufayl said, ‘I presented that which I had heard from it, to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> at Al-Kufa. He<sup>-asws</sup> said to me: ‘This is a special knowledge, and there is leeway for the general public to be ignorant of it to refer its knowledge to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>’. Then he<sup>-asws</sup> ratified to me of all what had been narrated to me regarding it, and read out to me regarding that a lot from the Quran and explained its explanation satisfactorily, to the extent that I ended up being more convince about the Return (Al-Raj’at) than the Day of Judgement’.</p>
<p>وكان مما قلت: يا أمير المؤمنين، أخبرني عن حوض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، أفي الدنيا هو أم في الآخرة؟ فقال: بل في الدنيا. قلت: فمن الذائد عنه؟ قال: أنا بيدي هذه، فليردنه أوليائي وليصرفن عنه أعدائي. قلت: يا أمير المؤمنين، قول الله تعالى: (وإذا وقع القول عليهم أخرجنا لهم دابة من الأرض تكلمهم، أن الناس…) الآية، ما الدابة؟ قال: يا أبا الطفيل، اله عن هذا.</p>
<p>And from what I said was, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, inform me about the Fountain of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, is it in the world or it is in the Hereafter?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘But, it is in the world’. I said, ‘So, who is the one who will defend (turn people back) from it?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> will, by these hands of mine<sup>-asws</sup>. So, my<sup>-asws</sup> friends will come near it, and my<sup>-asws</sup> enemies will be turned back from it’. I said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, the Statement of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> <strong><em>“[27:82] And when the word shall come to pass against them, We shall bring forth for them a creature from the earth that shall wound them, because people did not believe in Our communications”</em></strong>, what is the creature?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Abu Al-Tufayl, refrain from this’.</p>
<p>فقلت: يا أمير المؤمنين، أخبرني به جعلت فداك. قال: هي دابة تأكل الطعام وتمشي في الأسواق وتنكح النساء. فقلت: يا أمير المؤمنين، من هو؟ قال: هو زر الأرض الذي إليه تسكن الأرض. قلت: يا أمير المؤمنين، من هو؟ قال: صديق هذه الأمة وفاروقها ورئيسها وذو قرنها. قلت: يا أمير المؤمنين، من هو؟ قال: الذي قال الله عز وجل: (ويتلوه شاهد منه) ، والذي (عنده علم الكتاب)، (والذي جاء بالصدق)، والذي (صدق به) أنا، والناس كلهم كافرون غيري وغيره.</p>
<p>I said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, inform me about it, may I be sacrificed for you<sup>-asws</sup>’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘It is a creature which eats the food, and walks in the markets, and marries the women’. I said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, who is he?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘He is a necessity for the earth for it to be tranquil’. I said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, who is he?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘He is the Truthful (Siddique) of this community and its Differentiator (Farouq), and its chief, and its ‘Zukarn’’. I said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, who is he?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘The one about whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Said <strong><em>“[11:17] and a witness from Him recites it”</em></strong>, and the one <strong><em>“[13:43] and whoever has knowledge of the Book”</em></strong>, and the one <strong><em>“[39:33] And he who brings the truth and (he who) accepts it as the truth”</em></strong>, it is I<sup>-asws</sup>, and all of the people disbelieved apart from me<sup>-asws</sup>, and him<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p>قلت: يا أمير المؤمنين، فسمه لي. قال: قد سميته لك. يا أبا الطفيل، والله لو دخلت على عامة شيعتي الذين بهم أقاتل، الذين أقروا بطاعتي وسموني (أمير المؤمنين) واستحلوا جهاد من خالفني، فحدثتهم شهرا ببعض ما أعلم من الحق في الكتاب الذي نزل به جبرئيل على محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وببعض ما سمعت من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لتفرقوا عني حتى أبقى في عصابة حق قليلة، أنت وأشباهك من شيعتي.</p>
<p>I said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, name him for me’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said; ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> have named him for you. O Abu Al-Tufayl, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if the general public of the Shiites who have fought by my<sup>-asws</sup> side come to me<sup>-asws</sup>, those that have accepted to be obedient to me<sup>-asws</sup>, and call me<sup>-asws</sup> Amir-ul-Momineen, and consider it lawful to fight against the one who opposes me<sup>-asws</sup>, if I<sup>-asws</sup> were to narrate to them for months some of what I<sup>-asws</sup> know from the truth regarding the book which Jibraeel<sup>-as</sup> descended with upon Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup>, and some of what I<sup>-asws</sup> heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, they will disperse from me<sup>-asws</sup> until there will remain only a few of the truthful ones, you and those like you from my<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites’.</p>
<p>ففزعت وقلت: يا أمير المؤمنين، أنا وأشباهي نتفرق عنك أو نثبت معك؟ قال: لا، بل تثبتون. ثم أقبل علي فقال: إن أمرنا صعب مستصعب لا يعرفه ولا يقر به إلا ثلاثة: ملك مقرب أو نبي مرسل أو عبد مؤمن نجيب امتحن الله قلبه للإيمان. يا أبا الطفيل، إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قبض فارتد الناس ضلالا وجهالا(1)، إلا من عصمه الله بنا أهل البيت.</p>
<p>I panicked and said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, I and those like me, we will disperse from you<sup>-asws</sup>, or will we remain steadfast with you<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘No, but you will remain steadfast’. Then he<sup>-asws</sup> turned towards me and said: ‘Our<sup>-asws</sup> matters are difficult, and become more difficult, none understand it nor accept it except for three – an Angel of Proximity, or a ‘Mursil Nabi<sup>-as</sup>’,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> or a ‘Momin’<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> whose heart was Tested with Eman<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. O Abu Al-Tufayl, when the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away, the people turned apostate by straying and ignorance, except for the ones whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Protected by us<sup>-asws</sup>, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household’.</p>

<p>He<sup>-saww</sup> gave the good news: ‘O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, your<sup>-asws</sup> life and your<sup>-asws</sup> death is with me<sup>-saww</sup>, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are my<sup>-saww</sup> brother, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are my<sup>-saww</sup> successor<sup>-asws</sup>, and my<sup>-saww</sup> choice, and my<sup>-saww</sup> vizier, and my<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, and my<sup>-saww</sup> caller from me<sup>-saww</sup>, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are the fulfiller of my<sup>-saww</sup> debts, and the fulfiller of my<sup>-saww</sup> promises, and you<sup>-asws</sup> completer of my<sup>-saww</sup> responsibilities, and the returner of my<sup>-saww</sup> trusts, and the fighter on my<sup>-saww</sup> Sunnah against the breakers (of the covenant) of my<sup>-saww</sup> community, the unjust and the renegades, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are of the status with me<sup>-saww</sup> as Haroon<sup>sa</sup> had with Musa<sup>sa</sup>, and for you<sup>-asws</sup> are the best example of Haroon<sup>sa</sup> when his<sup>sa</sup> people considered him<sup>-as</sup> to be weak and were very close to killing him<sup>-as</sup>’.</p>
<p>فاصبر لظلم قريش إياك وتظاهرهم عليك، فإنك بمنزلة هارون من موسى ومن تبعه وهم بمنزلة العجل ومن تبعه. وإن موسى أمر هارون حين استخلفه عليهم: إن ضلوا فوجد أعوانا أن يجاهدهم بهم، وإن لم يجد أعوانا أن يكف يده ويحقن دمه ولا يفرق بينهم.</p>
<p>So, observe patience on the injustices of the Qureysh upon you<sup>-asws</sup> and their protests against you<sup>-asws</sup>, for you<sup>-asws</sup> are of the status, which Haroon<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>-as</sup>, and those that follow them (your<sup>-asws</sup> opponents) are of the status of the one who followed the calf. And Musa<sup>-as</sup> ordered Haroon<sup>-as</sup> to be the Caliph to them saying that if they were to stray, and if he<sup>-as</sup> should find ‘Al-Ansar’ he<sup>-as</sup> should fight against them, and if he<sup>-as</sup> does not find ‘Al-Ansar’, he<sup>-as</sup> should withhold his<sup>-as</sup> hand and save his<sup>-as</sup> blood, and not create differences between them.</p>
<p>إختلاف الأمة امتحان إلهي يا علي، ما بعث الله رسولا إلا وأسلم معه قوم طوعا وقوم آخرون كرها، فسلط الله الذين أسلموا كرها على الذين أسلموا طوعا فقتلوهم ليكون أعظم لأجورهم. يا علي، وإنه ما اختلفت أمة بعد نبيها إلا ظهر أهل باطلها على أهل حقها، وإن الله قضى الفرقة والاختلاف على هذه الأمة، ولو شاء لجمعهم على الهدى حتى لا يختلف اثنان من خلقه ولا يتنازع في شيء من أمره، ولا يجحد المفضول ذا الفضل فضله.</p>
<p>The differences, which are in the nation, are a Test of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>! Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> did not Send a Messenger<sup>-as</sup> (to a nation) except that a group submitted (to him<sup>-as</sup>) willingly and another group submitted (to him<sup>-as</sup>) reluctantly. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Made the reluctant group to overcome the willing group. They killed them and their (the willing group’s) Rewards were magnified. O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, no community differed after its Prophet<sup>-as</sup> except that the people of falsehood overcame the people of the truth, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Ordained sects and differences on this community, and had He<sup>-azwj</sup> so Desired, He<sup>-azwj</sup> could have Gathered them all on Guidance until no two from His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures would have differed, nor disputed regarding anything from the Commands, nor would the lowers ones fought against the higher ones for their status.</p>
<p>ولو شاء عجل النقمة فكان منه التغييرحتى يكذب الظالم ويعلم الحق أين مصيره، ولكن جعل الدنيا دار الأعمال وجعل الآخرة دار القرار، (ليجزي الذين أساؤوا بما عملوا ويجزي الذين أحسنوا بالحسنى). فقلت: الحمد لله شكرا على نعمائه وصبرا على بلائه وتسليما ورضى بقضائه.</p>
<p>If He<sup>-azwj</sup> so Desired He<sup>-azwj</sup> could have accelerated His<sup>-azwj</sup> Revenge to change them until the unjust would come to know where the truth lay, but He<sup>-azwj</sup> has Made the world to be a house of the deeds, and Made the Hereafter the house of the resolution’. <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[53:31] that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and (that) He may reward those who do good with goodness”</em></strong>.

<p><strong><u>كيفية تغسيل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله </u></strong></p>
<p>فلما قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أوصى عليا عليه السلام أن لا يلي غسله غيره، وأنه لا ينبغي لأحد أن يرى عورته غيره، وأنه ليس أحد يرى عورة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إلا ذهب بصره. فقال علي عليه السلام: يا رسول الله، فمن يعينني على غسلك؟ قال: جبرائيل في جنود من الملائكة. فكان علي عليه السلام يغسله، والفضل بن العباس مربوط العينين يصب الماء والملائكة يقلبونه له كيف شاء. ولقد أراد علي عليه السلام أن ينزع قميص رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، فصاح به صائح: (لا تنزع قميص نبيك، يا علي). فأدخل يده تحت القميص فغسله ثم حنطه وكفنه، ثم نزع القميص عند تكفينه وتحنيطه.</p>

<p>When the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away, he<sup>-saww</sup> bequeathed to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> that no one should wash him<sup>-saww</sup> apart from him<sup>-asws</sup>, and it does not befit anyone that he should see his<sup>-saww</sup> body parts other than him<sup>-asws</sup>, and that there is no one who would look at the body parts of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> except that his eyesight will be lost.

<p><strong><u>مفاجأة أهل البيت عليهم السلام بعمل أصحاب السقيفة </u></strong></p>
<p>قال البراء بن عازب: فلما قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله تخوفت أن تتظاهر قريش على إخراج هذا الأمر من بني هاشم. فلما صنع الناس ما صنعوا من بيعة أبي بكر أخذني ما يأخذ الواله الثكول مع ما بي من الحزن لوفاة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فجعلت أتردد وأرمق وجوه الناس، وقد خلا الهاشميون برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لغسله وتحنيطه.</p>

<p>Bara’a Bin Aazib said, ‘When the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away; I feared that the Quraish will take this matter (Caliphate) away from the Clan of Hashim. When the people did what they did by pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr, I was overcome by what a mother whose young son dies gets overcome by, along with the grief of the passing away of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. I reluctantly went to look at the faces of the people, and the Hashimites were engrossed with the washing of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and his<sup>-saww</sup> embalming.</p>
<p>وقد بلغني الذي كان من قول سعد بن عبادة ومن اتبعه من جهلة أصحابه، فلم أحفل بهم وعلمت أنه لا يؤول إلى شيء. فجعلت أتردد بينهم وبين المسجد وأتفقد وجوه قريش. فإني لكذلك إذ فقدت أبا بكر وعمر. ثم لم ألبث حتى إذا أنا بأبي بكر وعمر وأبي عبيدة قد أقبلوا في أهل السقيفة وهم محتجزون بالأزر الصنعانية لا يمر بهم أحد إلا خبطوه، فإذا عرفوه مدوا يده فمسحوها على يد أبي بكر، شاء ذلك أم أبى</p>
<p>And it had reached to me, that which Sa’d Bin Abada and those that followed him from the ignorant ones of his companions had said. I never participated with them and knew that it will not achieve anything. I reluctantly went to be between them and the Masjid, and I looked at the faces of the Qureish. I lost track of Abu Bakr and Umar. Then, I did not see them until later. Abu Bakr, and Umar, and Abu Ubeyda came in with the people of Al-Saqifa, and they were wearing the ‘San’aniya’ shirt, and there was no one that they would pass by, but would get confused. If they recognised someone, they would make him extend his hand and rub it against the hand of Abu Bakr, whether he liked that, or refused’.</p>
<p>فأنكرت عند ذلك عقلي جزعا منه، مع المصيبة برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فخرجت مسرعا حتى أتيت المسجد، ثم أتيت بني هاشم، والباب مغلق دونهم. فضربت الباب ضربا عنيفا وقلت: يا أهل البيت فخرج إلي الفضل بن العباس، فقلت: قد بايع الناس أبا بكر فقال العباس: (قد تربت أيديكم منها إلى آخر الدهر. أما إني قد أمرتكم فعصيتموني).</p>
<p>My mind did not accept that due to the anxiety from it, along with the calamity of the passing away of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. I went out quickly until I came to the Masjid, then I came up to the Clan of Hashim, and the door was closed, with no one there. I knocked on the door violently and said, ‘O People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household!’ Fazl Ibn Abbas came out. I said, ‘The people have pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr’. Al-Abbas said, ‘You have raised your hands from it (Caliphate) till the end of times. But, I had asked you to take it (Caliphate) but you disobeyed me’.</p>
<p><strong><u>ما جرى بين صالحي الصحابة ليلة السقيفة </u></strong></p>
<p>فكمثت أكابد ما في نفسي. فلما كان الليل خرجت إلى المسجد، فلما صرت فيه تذكرت أني كنت أسمع همهمة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بالقرآن. فانبعثت من مكاني فخرجت نحو الفضاء – فضاء بني بياضة -، فوجدت نفرا يتناجون. فلما دنوت منهم سكتوا، فانصرفت عنهم، فعرفوني وما عرفتهم، فدعوني إليهم فأتيتهم فإذا المقداد وأبو ذر وسلمان وعمار بن ياسر وعبادة بن الصامت وحذيفة بن اليمان والزبير بن العوام، وحذيفة يقول: والله ليفعلن ما أخبرتكم به. فوالله ما كذبت ولا كذبت. وإذا القوم يريدون أن يعيدوا الأمر شورى بين المهاجرين والأنصار.</p>

<p>I was remorseful in myself of what had happened. When it was night-time I went out to the Masjid. When I was inside it I remembered having heard the humming of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> reciting the Quran. I got up from my place and went to a place – the place of the Clan of Bayaaza. I found a number of people whispering to each other. When I approached them, they became silent. I went away from them. They had recognised me, and I had not recognised them. They called me over to them’. I came up to them, and there was Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Ammar Bin Yaaser<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abaadat Bin Al-Saamit, and Huzayfa Bin Al-Yamany<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Zubayr Bin Al-Awaam, and Huzyafa<sup>-ra</sup> was saying, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, he will do what I had informed you all that he will do, for by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I have not lied to you, nor have I been lied to. And the people want to have this matter referred to the assembly of the ‘al-Mahajir’ and the ‘Al-Ansar’’.</p>
<p>فقال حذيفة: انطلقوا بنا إلى أبي بن كعب فقد علم مثل ما علمت. فانطلقنا إلى أبي بن كعب فضربنا عليه بابه، فأتى حتى صار خلف الباب، ثم قال: من أنتم؟ فكلمه المقداد. فقال: ما جاء بكم؟ فقال: إفتح بابك، فإن الأمر الذي جئنا فيه أعظم من أن يجري وراء الباب. فقال: ما أنا بفاتح بابي، وقد علمت ما جئتم له. وما أنا بفاتح بابي، كأنكم أردتم النظر في هذا العقد. فقلنا: نعم. فقال: أفيكم حذيفة؟ فقلنا: نعم. قال: القول ما قال حذيفة، فأما أنا فلا أفتح بابي حتى يجري على ما هو جار عليه، ولما يكون بعدها شر منها، وإلى الله جل ثنائه المشتكى. قال: فرجعوا. ثم دخل أبي بن كعب بيته.</p>
<p>Huzayfa<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘Come with me to Abay Bin Ka’ab (house), as he knows similar to what I know’. We went to Abay Bin Ka’ab. We knocked on his door. He came but stood behind the door, then said, ‘Who are you all?’ He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup> ‘. He (Abay) said, ‘What have you come here for?’ He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘Open your door’ for the matter which we have come for (to discuss) is greater than to be discussed from behind the door’. He said, ‘I will not open my door, and I know what you have come for, and I will not open my door, it is as if you want this pact (allegiance to Abu Bakr) to be reconsidered’.</p>
<p>We said, ‘Yes’. He said, ‘Is Huzayfa<sup>-ra</sup> among you?’ We said, ‘Yes’. He said, ‘I say what Huzayfa<sup>-ra</sup> says, but, I will not open my door until that, which has happened to him<sup>-ra</sup>, happens to me, and what will be happening after it (allegiance) is more evil than it. And it is to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Majestic is His<sup>-azwj</sup> Praise, that I complain to’. We returned. Then Abay Bin Ka’ab entered into his house.</p>

<p>And the news reached Abu Bakr and Umar. They sent for Ubeydullah Ibn Jarrah, and Al-Mugheira Bin Sha’ba. They asked them both for them opinions. Al-Mugheira Bin Sha’ba said, ‘My opinion is that you should meet Al-Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib. You should entice him with regard to this that there will be a share for him in this matter, for him as well as for those after him. By that you will be able to cut him off Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> and sideline him<sup>-asws</sup>, for if Al-Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib comes with you, it will be the proof over the people, and the matter will becomes easier for you, as Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> would end up being alone’.</p>
<p>قال: فانطلق أبو بكر وعمر وأبو عبيدة بن الجراح والمغيرة بن شعبة حتى دخلوا على العباس بن عبد المطلب في الليلة الثانية من وفاة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. قال: فتكلم أبو بكر فحمد الله جل وعز وأثنى عليه ثم قال: إن الله بعث لكم محمدا نبيا وللمؤمنين وليا، فمن الله عليهم بكونه بين ظهرانيهم، حتى اختار له ما عنده وترك للناس أمرهم ليختاروا لأنفسهم مصلحتهم، متفقين لا مختلفين. فاختاروني عليهم واليا ولأمورهم راعيا، فتوليت ذلك. وما أخاف بعون الله وهنا ولا حيرة ولا جبنا، وما توفيقي إلا بالله. غير أني لا أنفك من طاعن يبلغني فيقول بخلاف قول العامة، فيتخذكم لجأ فتكونون حصنه المنيع وخطبه البديع، فإما دخلتم مع الناس فيما اجتمعوا عليه أو صرفتموهم عما مالوا إليه. فقد جئناك ونحن نريد أن نجعل لك في هذا الأمر نصيبا يكون لك ولعقبك من بعدك، إذ كنت عم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، وإن كان الناس أيضا قد رأوا مكانك ومكان صاحبك فعدلوا بهذا الأمر عنكما.</p>
<p>Abu Bakr, and Umar, and Abu Ubeyda Bin Al-Jarrah, and Al-Mugheira Bin Sha’ba went to Al-Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib on the second night from the passing away of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. Abu Bakr spoke. He Thanked Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic and Praised Him<sup>-azwj</sup>. Then he said, ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent to you Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup> as a Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> and a Guardian for the believers. He<sup>-saww</sup> was from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> to them for what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Chosen him<sup>-asws</sup> for what He<sup>-azwj</sup> had, and left the people to chose for themselves for their own affairs, in a united manner, not disputing with each other.

By the Help of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I have no fear here, nor am I confused, nor a coward, and there is no Reconciliation except by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.&nbsp; However, the taunts have reached me. They are saying against what the general public has said. They will come to you for shelter and take you as a fortress and magnificent speeches. So, you will either enter along with the people in what they have formed a consensus on, or turn them towards you. We have come to you, and we want you to have a share in this matter (Caliphate) to be for you and those to come after you. This is because you are the uncle of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and the people as well have seen your position, and the position of your companion. They have decided to keep this matter away from both of you (Abbas and Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>)’.</p>
<p>فقال عمر: أي والله، وأخرى يا بني هاشم على رسلكم، فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله منا ومنكم، وإنا لم نأتكم لحاجة منا إليكم، ولكن كرهنا أن يكون الطعن فيما اجتمع عليه المسلمون، فيتفاقم الخطب بكم وبهم. فانظروا لأنفسكم وللعامة. ثم سكت.</p>
<p>Umar said, ‘Yes, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and secondly, O Clan of Hashim, on your Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>. The Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> is from us and from you, and we have not come to you due to our need for you, but we do not like the people taunting us over what the Muslims have formed a consensus on, and the situation gets aggravated between you and them.

If you have sought this matter (Caliphate) by the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, you have taken our right. And if you have sought this by the believers, we are also from the believers. You did not present to us regarding your matter, and you did not consult with us, nor did you tell us about it, and we do not like you due to that.</p>
<p>We are also from the believers, and we are from those that hate you for this.

And if this matter is the right of the believers, then it is not for you to pass a Judgement in the rights of others. And if this is our right, we are not happy with a part of it without the other parts. And as for your word, O Umar, that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> is from us and from you, the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> is a tree and we are its branches, and you are in its vicinity, for we are the first ones for it, rather than you. And as for your words that you are afraid it would aggravate the situation between us and them, this is which you have already done earlier, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is the Helper’.</p>

<p>They went out from his presence, and Al-Abbas recited a eulogy. He said, ‘Don’t think that this matter will pass away from Hashim, then from Abu Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>. Was he<sup>-asws</sup> not the first one to Pray to your Qiblah? And he<sup>-asws</sup> is the most knowledgeable one of the people, of the effects and the Sunnah, and the nearest of the people, and he<sup>-asws</sup> was alone with the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> being helped by Jibraeel during the washing and the shrouding, and he<sup>-asws</sup> has all the merits that all the people have put together, and there is nothing in the people what is within him<sup>-asws</sup> from the merits.

So they said, ‘O group of ‘Al-Ansar’, the Qureysh are more rightful for this matter (Caliphate) than you because the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> is from the Qureysh, and the ‘al-Mahajir’ are better than you because Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Began with them in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book, and Extolled their preferences, and the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has said: ‘The Imams<sup>-asws</sup> will be from the Qureish’.’</p>
<p><strong><u>كيفية تغسيل النبي صلى الله عليه وآله والصلاة عليه</u></strong></p>
<p>قال سلمان: فأتيت عليا عليه السلام وهو يغسل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. وقد كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أوصى عليا عليه السلام أن لا يلي غسله غيره. فقال: يا رسول الله، فمن يعينني على ذلك؟ فقال: (جبرائيل). فكان علي عليه السلام لا يريد عضوا إلا قلب له. فلما غسله وحنطه وكفنه أدخلني وأدخل أبا ذر والمقداد وفاطمة والحسن والحسين عليهم السلام. فتقدم علي عليه السلام وصففنا خلفه وصلى عليه، وعائشة في الحجرة لا تعلم قد أخذ الله ببصرها. ثم أدخل عشرة من المهاجرين وعشرة من الأنصار، فكانوا يدخلون ويدعون ويخرجون، حتى لم يبق أحد شهد من المهاجرين والأنصار إلا صلى عليه.</p>

<p>Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘After that, the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> informed me<sup>-asws</sup>, and said: ‘The people will pay allegiance to Abu Bakr in the shade of the Clan of Sa’ada after having quarrelled against our<sup>-asws</sup> rights and our<sup>-asws</sup> proofs.

<p>علي عليه السلام يجمع القرآن ويعرضه على الناس فلما رآى غدرهم وقلة وفائهم له لزم بيته وأقبل على القرآن يؤلفه ويجمعه، فلم يخرج من بيته حتى جمعه وكان في الصحف والشظاظ والأسيار والرقاع. فلما جمعه كله وكتبه بيده على تنزيله وتأويله والناسخ منه والمنسوخ، بعث إليه أبو بكر أن اخرج فبايع. فبعث إليه علي عليه السلام: (إني لمشغول وقد آليت نفسي يمينا أن لا أرتدي رداء إلا للصلاة حتى أؤلف القرآن وأجمعه).</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> started collecting the Quran to present it to the people. When he<sup>-asws</sup> saw their treachery and their lack of loyalty to him<sup>-asws</sup>, he<sup>-asws</sup> turned towards the Quran to collect it. He<sup>-asws</sup> did not come out from his<sup>-asws</sup> house until he<sup>-asws</sup> had collected it, and it used to be written on the paper, and on the wood, and the skin, and other bits. When he<sup>-asws</sup> had collected the whole of it, and (was in the process of) writing it by his<sup>-asws</sup> own hand in accordance with its Revelation, and its explanation, and the Abrogating and the Abrogated, Abu Bakr sent for him<sup>-asws</sup> to come out and pay allegiance to him. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> sent a message to him: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> am busy and have taken it upon myself<sup>-asws</sup> that I<sup>-asws</sup> shall not put on a robe except for Prayer until I<sup>-asws</sup> have compiled the Quran and collected it’.</p>
<p>فسكتوا عنه أياما فجمعه في ثوب واحد وختمه، ثم خرج إلى الناس وهم مجتمعون مع أبي بكر في مسجد رسول الله. فنادى علي عليه السلام بأعلى صوته: (يا أيها الناس، إني لم أزل منذ قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مشغولا بغسله ثم بالقرآن حتى جمعته كله في هذا الثوب الواحد. فلم ينزل الله تعالى على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله آية إلا وقد جمعتها، وليست منه آية إلا وقد جمعتها وليست منه آية إلا وقد أقرأنيها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وعلمني تأويلها). ثم قال لهم علي عليه السلام: لئلا تقولوا غدا: (إنا كنا عن هذا غافلين). ثم قال لهم علي عليه السلام: لئلا تقولوا يوم القيامة إني لم أدعكم إلى نصرتي ولم أذكركم حقي، ولم أدعكم إلى كتاب الله من فاتحته إلى خاتمته. فقال عمر: ما أغنانا ما معنا من القرآن عما تدعونا إليه ثم دخل علي عليه السلام بيته.</p>
<p>So they kept quiet from him<sup>-asws</sup> for a few days. He<sup>-asws</sup> collected in one piece of cloth and sealed it, then came out to the people, and they had gathered around Abu Bakr in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> called out in a loud voice: ‘O you people! I<sup>-asws</sup> Since the passing away of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, I have been preoccupied with his<sup>-saww</sup> washing, then with the Quran, and did not cease until I<sup>-asws</sup> have collected all of it in this one cloth. There is no Verse that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> the High has Sent down on the Messenger of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> but I<sup>-asws</sup> have collected it, and there is no Verse from it except that I<sup>-asws</sup> have collected it, and there is no Verse from it except that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had read it out to me<sup>-asws</sup> and made known its explanation to me<sup>-asws</sup>’. Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said to them: ‘Lest you say tomorrow that <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[7:172] Surely we were heedless of this”</em></strong>. Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said to them: ‘Lest you say on the Day of Judgement that I<sup>-asws</sup> did not call you to help me<sup>-asws</sup> and did not remind you of my<sup>-asws</sup> right, and did not call you to the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> from its opening up to its end’. Umar said, ‘What we have from the Quran is sufficient for us, but rather, you<sup>-asws</sup> are calling us to yourself<sup>-asws</sup>’. Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> entered his<sup>-asws</sup> house’.</p>

<p>And Umar said to Abu Bakr, ‘Send a message to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> to pay allegiance, for there is nothing in this (Caliphate) until he<sup>-asws</sup> pays allegiance, and if he<sup>-asws</sup> were to do so, it will be secure’. Abu Bakr sent a message to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘Answer to the Caliph of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. The messenger came and said that to him<sup>-asws</sup>. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> replied to him: ‘Glory be to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, with what haste you have forged a lie to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, he knows and those that surround him know that the Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup> did not appoint a Caliph other than myself<sup>-asws</sup>’. The messenger went and informed him(Abu Bakr) of what he<sup>-asws</sup> had said to him.</p>
<p>قال: اذهب فقل له: (أجب أمير المؤمنين أبا بكر) فأتاه فأخبره بما قال. فقال له علي عليه السلام: سبحان الله ما والله طال العهد فينسى. فوالله إنه ليعلم أن هذا الاسم لا يصلح إلا لي، ولقد أمره رسول الله وهو سابع سبعة فسلموا علي بإمرة المؤمنين. فاستفهم هو وصاحبه عمر من بين السبعة فقالا: أحق من الله ورسوله؟ فقال لهما رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: نعم، حقا حقا من الله ورسوله إنه أمير المؤمنين وسيد المسلمين وصاحب لواء الغر المحجلين، يقعده الله عز وجل يوم القيامة على الصراط، فيدخل أوليائه الجنة وأعداءه النار. فانطلق الرسول فأخبره بما قال. قال: فسكتوا عنه يومهم ذلك.</p>
<p>Abu Bakr said, ‘Say to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘Answer to Amir-ul-Momineen Abu Bakr’. He came to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and informed him of what Abu Bakr had said. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said to him: ‘Glory be to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> it has not been long and he has forgotten it. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, he knows that this is a name, which is not correct except for myself<sup>-asws</sup>, and the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has ordered it, and he himself was the seventh one who had saluted me<sup>-asws</sup> as Amir-ul-Momineen. He (Abu Bakr) and his companion Umar were among those seven (people) who inquired by saying, ‘Is this truth from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>?’ The Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said to them: ‘Yes, truth.

<p>Umar said to Abu Bakr, ‘What is preventing you to send someone to him for the allegiance, for there is no one remaining except that he has paid allegiance apart from him<sup>-asws</sup> and those four’. And Abu Bakr was softer of the two men, and more thoughtful of the two, and the more benign of the two, and had more foresight of the two, and the other one was more short-tempered of the two, and hard-hearted of the two, and more oppressive of the two.

<p>He sent him, and sent some ‘Al-Ansar’ along with him, and they dashed to him<sup>-asws</sup>. They sought permission from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> to enter the house. He<sup>-asws</sup> did not permit them. The companions of Qunfuz returned to Abu Bakr and Umar – and they were both seated in the Masjid, and the people were around them.

Qunfuz the accursed returned. He and his companions entered without permission, and Ali<sup>-asws</sup> reached for his<sup>-asws</sup> sword.

She<sup>-asws</sup> did not cease being bed-ridden as a result, until she<sup>-asws</sup> passed away from that as a martyr’.</p>
<p>قال: ولما انتهى بعلي عليه السلام إلى أبي بكر انتهره عمر وقال له: بايع ودع عنك هذه الأباطيل فقال عليه السلام له: فإن لم أفعل فما أنتم صانعون ؟ قالوا: نقتلك ذلا وصغارا فقال عليه السلام: إذا تقتلون عبد الله وأخا رسوله. فقال أبو بكر: أما عبد الله فنعم، وأما أخو رسول الله فما نقر بهذا قال: أتجحدون أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله آخى بيني وبينه ؟ قال: نعم. فأعاد ذلك عليهم ثلاث مرات. ثم أقبل عليهم علي عليه السلام فقال: يا معشر المسلمين والمهاجرين والأنصار، أنشدكم الله، أسمعتم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول يوم غدير خم كذا وكذا وفي غزوة تبوك كذا وكذا ؟ فلم يدع عليه السلام شيئا قاله فيه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله علانية للعامة إلا ذكرهم إياه. قالوا: اللهم نعم.</p>
<p>When they ended up with Ali<sup>-asws</sup> to Abu Bakr, Umar rebuked him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘Pay allegiance, and stay away from these vanities. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘And if I<sup>-asws</sup> do not do this, what will you do?’ He said, ‘We will kill you<sup>-asws</sup> with humiliation and degradation’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Will you kill the servant of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the brother of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘As for being a servant of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, it is correct, but as for being a brother of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, we do not accept it’.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Are you denying that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> established brotherhood between myself<sup>-asws</sup> and himself<sup>-saww</sup>?’ He said, ‘Yes’. He<sup>-asws</sup> repeated that thrice to him. Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> addressed them by saying: ‘O group of Muslims, and the ‘al-Mahajir’ and the ‘Al-Ansar’.

<p>When Abu Bakr feared that the people might help him<sup>-asws</sup>, in order to stop them he surprised them by saying to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘All that which you<sup>-asws</sup> have said is true.

<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Is there anyone from the companions of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> of this which is with you?’ Umar said, ‘The Caliph of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has spoken the truth, I heard from him<sup>-saww</sup> as he has said’.

<p>Then he (Umar) said, ‘Arise, O son<sup>-asws</sup> of Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, pay allegiance’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘If I<sup>-asws</sup> don’t do it?’ He said, ‘Then, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, we will cut off your<sup>-asws</sup> neck’. He said this to him<sup>-asws</sup> three times, then another one extended his<sup>-asws</sup> hand and opened his<sup>-asws</sup> hand. Abu Bakr struck his<sup>-asws</sup> hand and he was happy with that regarding it. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> called out, before the allegiance – and the rope was around his<sup>-asws</sup> neck -: <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[7:150] Son of my mother! surely the people reckoned me weak and had well-nigh slain me”</em></strong>.</p>

<p>And it was said to Al-Zubeyr, ‘Pay allegiance’. He refused. Umar, and Khalid Bin Waleed, and Al-Mugheira Bin Sha’ba were among the people who rushed towards him. They seized his sword from his hand. They struck it on the ground until they broke it, then they held him in a stranglehold. Al-Zubeyr said – and Umar was on his chest – ‘O son of Sahhaak, but by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if my sword was in my hand I would have buried you’. Then he (was forced to) paid allegiance. Salman<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘Then they grabbed me<sup>-ra</sup> and throttle my<sup>-ra</sup> neck until it was like a commodity. Then they grabbed my<sup>-ra</sup> hand and twisted it. I<sup>-ra</sup> unwillingly paid allegiance. Then Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> and Al-Miqdad paid allegiance unwillingly. No one from the community was forced to paid allegiance (unwillingly) apart from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and four of us’.</p>
<p>ولم يكن منا أحد أشد قولا من الزبير، فإنه لما بايع قال: يابن صهاك، أما والله لولا هؤلاء الطغاة الذين أعانوك لما كنت تقدم علي ومعي سيفي لما أعرف من جبنك ولؤمك، ولكن وجدت طغاة تقوي بهم وتصول. فغضب عمر وقال: أتذكر صهاك ؟ فقال: ومن صهاك وما يمنعني من ذكرها ؟ وقد كانت صهاك زانية، أو تنكر ذلك ؟ أو ليس كانت أمة حبشية لجدي عبد المطلب، فزنى بها جدك نفيل، فولدت أباك الخطاب فوهبها عبد المطلب لجدك – بعد ما زنى بها – فولدته، وإنه لعبد لجدي ولد زنا ؟ فأصلح بينهما أبو بكر وكف كل واحد منهما عن صاحبه.</p>
<p>And there was no one from us who was harsher in his words than Al-Zubeyr, for when he paid allegiance, he said, ‘O son of Sahhaak, but, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, were it not for these tyrants who are your ‘Al-Ansar’ you would not have been able to overcome me and I would have had my sword with me since I am aware of your cowardice and wickedness, but you have found strength in the tyrants and are on the attack’. Umar got angry and said, ‘You are mentioning Sahhaak?’ He said, ‘And who Sahhaak, and what prevents me from mentioning her? And Sahhaak was an adulteress, or are you denying that? Or was she not from the people of Ethiopia given to my grandfather Abdul Muttalib<sup>-as</sup>? Your grandfather Nufail committed adultery with her and your father Al-Khattaab was born as a result. Abdul Muttalib<sup>-as</sup> gifted her to your grandfather – after him (Nufail) having committed adultery with her – and he was born, and he is therefore the slave of my grandfather having been born from adultery? Abu Bakr made peace between the two, and made each of them withhold his hand from his companion.</p>

Umar said, ‘O Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, now that your companion<sup>-asws</sup> has paid allegiance and so have you, you can say what you like and do what you like, and your companion<sup>-asws</sup> can say what he<sup>-asws</sup> wants’.</p>
<p>قال سلمان: فقلت: سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (إن عليك وعلى صاحبك الذي بايعته مثل ذنوب جميع أمته إلى يوم القيامة ومثل عذابهم جميعا). فقال: قل ما شئت، أليس قد بايعت ولم يقر الله عينيك بأن يليها صاحبك ؟ فقلت: أشهد أني قد قرأت في بعض كتب الله المنزلة: (إنك – باسمك ونسبك وصفتك – باب من أبواب جهنم) فقالوا لي: قل ما شئت، أليس قد أزالها الله عن أهل هذا البيت الذين اتخذتموهم أربابا من دون الله ؟</p>
<p>Salman<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘I<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘I<sup>-ra</sup> have heard the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say that to you (Umar) and to your companion (Abu Bakr) whom you have paid allegiance to, will be the like (carrying) sins of the entire community up to the Day of Judgement, and the like of their entire Punishment’. He said, ‘Say what you like.

<p>فقلت له: أشهد أني سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول، وسألته عن هذه الاية: (فيومئذ لا يعذب عذابه أحد ولا يوثق وثاقه أحد)، فأخبرني بأنك أنت هو. فقال عمر: أسكت، أسكت الله نامتك، أيها العبد، يابن اللخناء فقال علي عليه السلام: أقسمت عليك يا سلمان لما سكت. فقال سلمان: والله لو لم يأمرني علي عليه السلام بالسكوت لخبرته بكل شيئ نزل فيه، وكل شيئ سمعته من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فيه وفي صاحبه. فلما رأني عمر قد سكت قال لي: إنك له لمطيع مسلم.</p>
<p>I<sup>-ra</sup> said to him, ‘I<sup>-ra</sup> bear witness that I<sup>-ra</sup> have heard the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say, and I<sup>-ra</sup> asked him<sup>-saww</sup> about this Verse <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[89:25] But on that day shall no one chastise with (anything like) His chastisement, [89:26] And no one shall bind with (anything like) His binding”</em></strong>, he<sup>-saww</sup> informed me<sup>-ra</sup> that it means you’. Umar said, ‘Silence, silence, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Make you sleep (die), O slave, O son of the evil-tongued’.</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> give you<sup>-ra</sup> a vow, O Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, keep quiet’.

Then you<sup>-asws</sup> will be killed and your beard will be dyed by the blood of your<sup>-asws</sup> head.

<p>قال أبان: وحدثت بهذا الحديث الحسن البصري عن أبي ذر، فقال: صدق سليم وصدق أبو ذر. لعلي بن أبي طالب السابقة في الدين والعلم والحكمة والفقه، وفي الرأي والصحبة وفي الفضل وفي البسطة وفي العشيرة وفي الصهر، وفي النجدة في الحرب، وفي الجود وفي الماعون وفي العلم بالقضاء وفي القرابة للرسول والعلم بالقضاء والفصل وفي حسن البلاء في الإسلام. إن عليا في كل أمر أمره علي، فرحم الله عليا وصلى عليه. ثم بكى حتى بل لحيته.</p>

<p>Abaan said that this Hadith was narrated to him by Al-Hassan Al-Basry from Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, ‘Sulaym spoke the truth, and Abdu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> spoke the truth for Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, the foremost in the Religion, and the knowledge, and the wisdom, and the understanding, and in the opinion, and the socialising, and in the preference, and in the reputation, and in the relationships, and for help in the battle, and in the generosity, and in the kindness, and in the knowledge of Judgements, and in being close relation with the Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>, and the knowledge of the Judgements, and the intricacies (of speech) and in betterment in Islam. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> was highest in every matter of his<sup>-asws</sup>. May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on him<sup>-asws</sup> and Send Blessings on him<sup>-asws</sup>’. Then he wept until his beard was wet (with the tears)’.</p>
<p>قال: فقلت له: يا أبا سعيد، أتقول لأحد غير النبي (صلى الله عليه) إذا ذكرته؟ فقال: ترحم على المسلمين إذا ذكرتهم وصل على محمد وآل محمد. وإن عليا خير آل محمد. فقلت: يا أبا سعيد، خير من حمزة ومن جعفر ومن فاطمة ومن الحسن والحسين؟ فقال: إي والله، إنه لخير منهم، ومن يشك أنه خير منهم؟ فقلت له: بما ذا؟ قال: إنه لم يجر عليه اسم شرك ولا كفر ولا عبادة صنم ولا شرب خمر. وعلي خير منهم بالسبق إلى الإسلام والعلم بكتاب الله وسنة نبيه.</p>
<p>So, I said to him, ‘O Abu Saeed, do you say for anyone, apart from the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, “May the Blessings of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> be upon him”, when you mention him?’ He said, ‘I ask for Mercy to be upon the Muslims when I mention them, and Blessings upon Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup> and the progeny<sup>-asws</sup> of Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup>, and Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is the best of the Progeny<sup>-asws</sup> of Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup>’. I said, ‘O Abu Saeed, better than Hamza<sup>-as</sup>, and Ja’far<sup>-as</sup>, and Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He said, ‘Yes, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, he<sup>-asws</sup> is better than them, and who will doubt that he<sup>-asws</sup> is better than them?’ I asked him, ‘Why is that?’ He said, ‘He<sup>-asws</sup> never uttered a name of Polytheism (Shirk) nor of disbelief, nor did he<sup>-asws</sup> ever worship idols, nor ever drunk intoxicants. And Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is better than them by being foremost in Islam, and by the knowledge of the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>وإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قال لفاطمة عليها السلام: (زوجتك خير أمتي)، فلو كان في الأمة خيرا منه لاستثناه. وإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله آخى بين أصحابه، وآخى بين علي ونفسه، فرسول الله خيرهم نفسا وخيرهم أخا. ونصبه يوم غدير خم وأوجب له من الولاية على الناس مثل ما أوجب لنفسه فقال: (من كنت مولاه فعلي مولاه). وقال له: (أنت مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى)، ولم يقل ذلك لأحد من أهل بيته ولا لأحد من أمته غيره. وله سوابق كثيرة ومناقب ليس لأحد من الناس مثلها.</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said to Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> got you<sup>-asws</sup> married to the best of my<sup>-saww</sup> community’. Had there been anyone better in the community he<sup>-saww</sup> would have made an exception for it. And the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> established brotherhood between his<sup>-saww</sup> companions, and brotherhood between Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and himself<sup>-saww</sup>. The Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> is better than them and better than them as a brother. And he<sup>-saww</sup> established him<sup>-asws</sup> on the Day of Ghadeer Khumm, and more than obligated the Wilayah on the people, just like what he<sup>-saww</sup> more than obligated it upon himself<sup>-saww</sup>. He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘The one who’s Master I<sup>-saww</sup> was, Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is his Master’. And he<sup>-saww</sup> said to him<sup>-asws</sup>: ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> are unto me<sup>-saww</sup> of the status of Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>sa</sup>’, and he<sup>-saww</sup> never said that to anyone from his<sup>-saww</sup> Household, nor to anyone from the community apart from him<sup>-asws</sup>. For him<sup>-asws</sup> there are numerous precedence, and merits which are not for anyone from the people, the like of these’.</p>
<p>قال: فقلت له: من خير هذه الأمة بعد علي عليه السلام؟ قال: زوجته وابناه. قلت: ثم من؟ قال: ثم جعفر وحمزة. إن خير الناس أصحاب الكساء الذين نزلت فيهم آية التطهير، ضم فيه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله نفسه وعليا وفاطمة والحسن والحسين، ثم قال: هؤلاء ثقتي وعترتي في أهل بيتي، فأذهب الله عنهم الرجس وطهرهم تطهيرا. فقالت أم سلمة: أدخلني معك ومعهم في الكساء. فقال لها: يا أم سلمة، أنت بخير وإلى خير، وإنما نزلت هذه الآية في وفي هؤلاء خاصة.</p>
<p>I said to him, ‘Who is the best of this community after Ali<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He said, ‘His<sup>-asws</sup> wife<sup>-asws</sup>, and his<sup>-asws</sup> sons<sup>-asws</sup>’. I said, ‘Then who?’ He said, ‘Then Ja’far<sup>-as</sup>, and Hamza<sup>-as</sup>. The best of the people are the Companions of the Blanket (As’haab Al-Kisaa) regarding whom the Verse of the Purification was revealed. Included in it was the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> himself<sup>-saww</sup>, and Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>. Then he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘These<sup>-asws</sup> are my<sup>-saww</sup> trusted ones, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Family among the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Kept away from them<sup>-asws</sup> the impurity, and Purified them a thorough purifying’. Umm Salma<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘Include me<sup>-ra</sup> along with you<sup>-saww</sup> and with them<sup>-asws</sup> in the Blanket’. He<sup>-saww</sup> said to her<sup>-ra</sup>: ‘O Umm Salma<sup>-ra</sup>, you<sup>-ra</sup> are with good and upon good, but this Verse has come down especially regarding myself<sup>-saww</sup> and them<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p><strong><u>محاولة الحسن البصري تبرير نفاقه </u></strong></p>
<p>فقلت: الله يا أبا سعيد ما ترويه في علي عليه السلام وما سمعتك تقول فيه؟ قال: يا أخي، أحقن بذلك دمي من هؤلاء الجبابرة الظلمة لعنهم الله. يا أخي، لولا ذلك لقد شالت بي الخشب ولكني أقول ما سمعت فيبلغهم ذلك فيكفون عني. وإنما أعني ببغض علي غير علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام، فيحسبون أني لهم ولي. قال الله عز وجل: (ادفع بالتي هي أحسن السيئة) يعني التقية.</p>

<p>I said, ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>!

O my brother, had it not been for that, I would have been lifted by the wood (my funeral would have taken place), but, I am saying what you have heard so that it would reach them and they would hold back from me. But what I mean by hatred towards Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is hatred towards other than Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, so that they will count me as a friend to them. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Said <strong><em>“[23:96] Repel evil by what is best”</em></strong>, it means the ‘Taqqiya’ (dissimulation)’.</p>

<p>ففرقة واحدة منها تدين بدين الرحمن، واثنتان وسبعون تدين بدين الشيطان وتتولى على قبولها وتتبرأ ممن خالفها. فأما من وحد الله وآمن برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ولم يعرف ولايتنا ولا ضلالة عدونا ولم ينصب شيئا ولم يحل ولم يحرم، وأخذ بجميع ما ليس بين المختلفين من الأمة فيه خلاف في أن الله عز وجل أمر به، وكف عما بين المختلفين من الأمة خلاف في أن الله أمر به أو نهى عنه، فلم ينصب شيئا ولم يحلل ولم يحرم ولا يعلم ورد علم ما أشكل عليه إلى الله فهذا ناج.</p>
<p>One sect will make it a religion to be on the Religion of the beneficents, and the seventy two will make it a religion to be on the religion of the Satan, and befriend those that have accepted it and keep away from those that have opposed it. As for the one who believes in Oneness of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and believes in the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and never understood our<sup>-asws</sup> Wilayah, nor the straying of our<sup>-asws</sup> enemies, and never established anything, and did not make anything to be permissible or prohibited, and took all that is not among the differences in the community, in case they end up going against the Order of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic, with regards to it, and paused at what is among the differences in the community, in case they oppose what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Ordered with regards to it or Prohibited it, and never established anything, and never made anything permissible or prohibited, and do not know who to refer to when they come across what is difficult for them, their case will be left to (the Mercy) of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, so these will be rescued.</p>

<p>فمن لم يجعله الله عارفا فلا حجة عليه، وعليه أن يقف ويكف عما لا يعلم، فلا يعذبه الله على جهله. فإنما يحمده على عمله بالطاعة ويعذبه على عمله بالمعصية. ويستطيع أن يطيع ويستطيع أن يعصي، ولا يستطيع أن يعرف ويستطيع أن يجهل؟ هذا محال لا يكون شيئ من ذلك إلا بقضاء من الله وقدره وعلمه وكتابه بغير جبر لأنهم لو كانوا مجبورين كانوا معذورين وغير محمودين. ومن جهل وسعه أن يرد إلينا ما أشكل عليه ومن حمد الله على النعمة واستغفره من المعصية وأحب المطيعين وحمدهم على الطاعة، وأبغض العاصين وذمهم فإنه يكتفي بذلك إذا رد علمه إلينا.</p>
<h2 id="the-efforts-of-the-ignorant-by-the-truth" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc341095406"></a>The efforts of the ignorant by the truth</h2>
<p>The one who Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has not Made to be an ‘A’arif (understanding one), there is no Proof to him, and for him it is to pause where he does not know. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will not Punish him on his ignorance. But rather, He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Praise him on his deeds of obedience, and Punish him on his deeds of disobedience. And he has the ability that he should obey, and he has the ability that he should not obey, and does he have the ability that he can understand, and does he have the ability to remain ignorant? This is impossible. There is nothing that can be from that without Decree of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Power, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Knowledge, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book without compulsion, because if they were to be under compulsion, they would be in a state of helplessness and not praiseworthy. And the one who is ignorant, he has the leniency that he can refer to us<sup>-asws</sup> in what is difficult for him, and the one who Praises Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for His<sup>-azwj</sup> Favours, and seeks Forgiveness for his acts of disobedience, and loves the obedient and praises them on their obedience, and abhors the disobedient ones and condemns them, that would be sufficient for him if he were to refer his knowledge to us<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>

<h2 id="meaning-of-islam-and-the-faith" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc341095410"></a>MEANING OF ISLAM AND THE FAITH</h2>
<p><strong>) 1 </strong><strong>(</strong> وعن أبان بن أبي عياش عن سليم بن قيس قال: سمعت علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام – وسأله رجل عن الإيمان – فقال: يا أمير المؤمنين، أخبرني عن الإيمان، لا أسأل عنه أحدا غيرك ولا بعدك. فقال علي عليه السلام: جاء رجل إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسأله عن مثل ما سألتني عنه، فقال له مثل مقالتك، فأخذ يحدثه. ثم قال له: اقعد. فقال له: آمنت.</p>
<p><strong>1 –</strong> And from Abaan Bin Abu Ayyah, from Sulaym Bin Qays who said, ‘I heard Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> – and a man asked him<sup>-asws</sup> about the Eman (faith) – he said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, inform me about the faith, I have not asked about it apart from you<sup>-asws</sup>, nor will I ask anyone after you<sup>-asws</sup>’. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘A man went to the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> and asked him<sup>-saww</sup> similar to what you have asked me<sup>-asws</sup>. His<sup>-saww</sup> reply to him was similar to what I<sup>-asws</sup> am going to tell you, so take what he<sup>-saww</sup> narrated to him’. Then he<sup>-asws</sup> said to him: ‘Be seated’. He said to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘I act as you<sup>-asws</sup> command’.</p>
<p>ثم أقبل علي عليه السلام على الرجل فقال: أما علمت أن جبرئيل أتى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في صورة آدمي فقال له: ما الإسلام؟ فقال: (شهادة أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله وإقام الصلاة وإيتاء الزكاة وحج البيت وصيام شهر رمضان والغسل من الجنابة). فقال: وما الإيمان؟ قال: (تؤمن بالله وملائكته وكتبه ورسله وبالحياة بعد الموت وبالقدر كله خيره وشره وحلوه ومره).</p>
<p>Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> faced the man and said: ‘But, get to know that Jibraeel came to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> in the human form and said to him<sup>-saww</sup>: ‘What is Islam?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Testifying that there is no God but Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and that Mohammed<sup>-saww</sup> is the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and the establishing of Prayers and the giving of the Zakaat, and the Pilgrimage of the House, and the Fasting of the Month of Ramadhan, and the Major Ablution’.</p>
<p>He said: ‘What is the Eman?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Believing in Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the Angels, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Books, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messengers<sup>-as</sup>, and of life after death, and Fate (Al-Qadr), all of it, be it good or bad, sweet or sour’.</p>
<p>فلما قام الرجل قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (هذا جبرئيل، جاءكم ليعلمكم دينكم). فكان كلما قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله شيئا قال له: (صدقت). قال: فمتى الساعة؟ قال: ما المسؤول عنها بأعلم من السائل. قال: صدقت.</p>
<p>When the man stood up, the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘This was Jibraeel. He came to you to teach you about your Religion’. Whatever the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said to him of anything, he (Jibraeel) said to him<sup>-saww</sup>, ‘You<sup>-saww</sup> have spoken the truth’. He (Jibraeel) said: ‘So, when is the Hour?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘There is no knowledge of it with the questioned one than there is with the questioner’. He said, ‘You<sup>-saww</sup> have spoken the truth’.</p>
<p><strong><u>)</u></strong><strong><u> 2 </u></strong><strong><u>(</u></strong><strong><u> دعائم الإيمان </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم قال علي عليه السلام – بعد ما فرغ من قول جبرئيل (صدقت) -: ألا إن الإيمان بني على أربع دعائم: على اليقين والصبر والعدل والجهاد. فاليقين منه على أربع شعب: على الشوق والشفق والزهد والترقب. فمن اشتاق إلى الجنة سلا عن الشهوات، ومن أشفق من النار اتقى المحرمات، ومن زهد في الدنيا هانت عليه المصيبات، ومن ارتقب الموت سارع في الخيرات.</p>
<h2 id="2-the-pillars-of-faith" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc341095411"></a>2 – The Pillars of Faith</h2>
<p>Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said, after having related the words of Jibraeel where he said, ‘You<sup>-saww</sup> have spoken the truth’, ‘But, the Faith is built on four pillars – on the conviction, and the patience, and the justice, and the struggle. As for the conviction from it, is on four branches – on the desire, and the fear, and the asceticism, and the anticipation. The one who desires for the Paradise will withdraw from the desires, and the one who has fear from the Fire will keep away from the Prohibitions, and the one who is ascetic in the world, his troubles will become easy for him, and the one who anticipates the death, will make haste in doing the good deeds’.</p>
<p>والصبر على أربع شعب: على تبصرة الفطنة وتأول الحكمة ومعرفة العبرة وسنة الأولين. فمن تبصر الفطنة تبين في الحكمة، ومن تبين في الحكمة عرف العبرة، ومن عرف العبرة تأول الحكمة، ومن تأول الحكمة أبصر العبرة، ومن أبصر العبرة فكأنما كان في الأولين.</p>
<p>And the patience is on four branches – on intelligent observation, and the explanation of the wisdom, and learning a lesson, and the ways of the former ones. The one who observes intelligently, the wisdom will become clear for him, and the one for who the wisdom becomes clear, will take a lesson from it, and the one who takes a lesson will interpret the wisdom, and the one who interprets the wisdom will take the lesson, and the one who takes the lesson, will be as if he is among the former ones.</p>
<p>والعدل منه على أربع شعب: على غوامض الفهم وغمر العلم وزهرة الحكم وروضة الحلم. فمن فهم فسر جمل العلم، ومن علم عرضه شرائع الحكمة، ومن حلم لم يفرط في أمره وعاش به في الناس حميدا.</p>
<p>From it, Justice is on four branches – On mysteries of the understanding, and the immersion in the knowledge, and the flower of the wisdom, and the garden of the tolerance. The one, who understands, will explain all the knowledge, and the one who has knowledge, the laws of wisdom will present them to him, and the one who is tolerant, will not waste his affairs, and will live such a life that the people will be pleased with him.</p>
<p>والجهاد على أربع شعب: على الأمر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر والصدق في المواطن والغضب لله وشنآن الفاسقين. فمن أمر بالمعروف شد ظهر المؤمن ومن نهى عن المنكر أرغم أنف الفاسق، ومن صدق في المواطن قضى الذي عليه، ومن شنأ الفاسقين وغضب لله غضب الله له. وذلك الإيمان ودعائمه وشعبه.</p>
<p>And the Struggle (Jihad) is on four branches – on the enjoining of the good, and the forbidding of the evil, and the honesty in the matters, and the anger for the Sake of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and abhorrence of the evil-doers. The one who enjoins the good will strengthen the back of the believer, and the one who forbids the evil will grind the nose of the evil-doer, and the one who is sincere in the matters will fulfil that which is for him, and the one who abhors the evil-doers, and has anger for the Sake of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Will get Angry on his behalf. And that is the Eman and its pillars and its branches’.</p>
<p><strong><u>أدنى درجات الإيمان والكفر والضلالة </u></strong></p>

<p>He said to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, what is the minimum by which a man becomes a Momin, and the minimum by which he becomes a kafir (an infidel), and the minimum by which he strays?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Now that you have asked me, listen to the answer. The minimum by which one becomes a Momin is that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Makes him to recognise Himself<sup>-azwj</sup>. He accepts to Him<sup>-azwj</sup> of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Lordship, and the Oneness, and he recognises His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> and accepts his<sup>-saww</sup> Prophet-hood, and his<sup>-saww</sup> preaching. And that he recognises the Proof<sup>-asws</sup> in His<sup>-azwj</sup> earth, and the witness on His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures. He accepts to him<sup>-asws</sup> by obedience’. I said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, if he is ignorant of all the other things which you<sup>-asws</sup> have not described?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Yes, if he is Ordered to do something, he obeys, and if he is prohibited from something, he refrains.</p>
<p>وأدنى ما يكون به كافرا أن يتدين بشيئ فيزعم أن الله أمره به – مما نهى الله عنه – ثم ينصبه دينا فيتبرأ ويتولى ويزعم أنه يعبد الله الذي أمره به.</p>
<p>And the minimum, by which one becomes a Kafir, is when he makes something to be his religion thinking that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Ordered it to be so – from what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Prohibited from it – then establishes it as his religion. So he keeps away and befriends on the basis of that and thinks that he is worshipping Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, the Orders which He<sup>-azwj</sup> has Commanded for.</p>
<p>وأدنى ما يكون به ضالا أن لا يعرف حجة الله في أرضه وشاهده على خلقه الذي أمر الله بطاعته وفرض ولايته.</p>

<p><strong>* 1 * </strong><strong>&nbsp;– </strong>أبان عن سليم، قال: قلت لعلي عليه السلام: يا أمير المؤمنين، إني سمعت من سلمان والمقداد وأبي ذر شيئا من تفسير القرآن ومن الرواية عن النبي صلى الله عليه وآله، ثم سمعت منك تصديق ما سمعت منهم. ورأيت في أيدي الناس أشياء كثيرة من تفسير القرآن ومن الأحاديث عن النبي صلى الله عليه وآله تخالف الذي سمعته منكم، وأنتم تزعمون أن ذلك باطل. أفترى الناس يكذبون على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله متعمدين ويفسرون القرآن برأيهم؟ قال: فأقبل علي فقال لي: يا سليم، قد سألت فافهم الجواب. إن في أيدي الناس حقا وباطلا، وصدقا وكذبا، وناسخا ومنسوخا، وخاصا وعاما، ومحكما ومتشابها، وحفظا ووهما. وقد كذب على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله على عهده حتى قام فيهم خطيبا فقال: (أيها الناس، قد كثرت علي الكذابة. فمن كذب علي متعمدا فليتبوأ مقعده من النار). ثم كذب عليه من بعده حين توفي، رحمة الله على نبي الرحمة وصلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p><strong>1 –</strong>Sulaym narrated Abaan that I said to Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, I heard from Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> things from the commentary of the Quran, and from reports from the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, then I heard its ratification from you<sup>-asws</sup> of what I heard. And I saw in the hands of the people, many things from the commentary of the Quran, and from the Ahadith from the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> which were different from what I heard from you all, and you all think that those are invalid. Have the people fabricated lies against the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> intentionally, and are interpreting the Quran by their opinions?’</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> turned towards me and said to me: ‘O Sulaym, You have asked, so understand its answer. That which is in the hands of the people is valid as well as invalid, truth and lies, and abrogating and abrogated, and specific as well as general, and decisive and allegorical, and memorised and suspect. And they have lied against the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> during his<sup>-saww</sup> era to the extent that he<sup>-saww</sup> stood up and preached to them saying: ‘O you people! A lot of lies have been attributed to me<sup>-saww</sup>. The one who forges a lie against me<sup>-saww</sup> intentionally has reserved a seat for himself in the Fire’. Then they lied against him<sup>-saww</sup> after his<sup>-saww</sup> passing away. May the Mercy of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> be upon the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Mercy, and Blessings of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> be upon him<sup>-saww</sup> and his<sup>-saww</sup> Progeny<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>المحدثون أربعة وإنما يأتيك بالحديث أربعة نفر ليس لهم خامس: رجل منافق مظهر للإيمان متصنع بالإسلام، لا يتأثم ولا يتحرج أن يكذب على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله متعمدا. فلو علم المسلمون أنه منافق كذاب لم يقبلوا منه ولم يصدقوه، ولكنهم قالوا: (هذا صاحب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، رآه وسمع منه وهو لا يكذب ولا يستحل الكذب على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله). وقد أخبر الله عن المنافقين بما أخبر ووصفهم بما وصفهم فقال الله عز وجل: (وإذا رأيتهم تعجبك أجسامهم وإن يقولوا تسمع لقولهم). ثم بقوا بعده وتقربوا إلى أئمة الضلال والدعاة إلى النار بالزور والكذب والنفاق والبهتان، فولوهم الأعمال وحملوهم على رقاب الناس وأكلوا بهم من الدنيا. وإنما الناس مع الملوك في الدنيا إلا من عصم الله. فهذا أول الأربعة.</p>
<p>The narrators are four, but rather those that come to you with the Ahadith are four in number and there is no fifth of them – A hypocrite man who displays the faith to make believe that he is with Islam. He does not consider it to be a sin, and does not feel shy of lying, intentionally, against the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. Had the Muslims come to know that he is a lying hypocrite, they would not have accepted from him, nor would they have ratified him, but they are saying, ‘This is a companion of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, who saw him<sup>-saww</sup> and heard from him<sup>-asws</sup>, and he is not a liar nor does he consider it permissible to lie against the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Informed about the hypocrites by what He<sup>-azwj</sup> has Informed, and Described them. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Said: <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[63:4] And when you see them, their persons will please you, and If they speak, you will listen to their speech (They are as (worthless as hollow) pieces of timber propped up, (unable to stand on their own). They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies; so beware of them. The curse of Allah be on them! How are they deluded (away from the Truth)!”</em></strong>. Then they remained after him<sup>-saww</sup>, and went near to the Imams of straying, and called towards the Fire with the deception, and the lies, and the hypocrisy and the slander. They appointed them for works and bore them as riders upon the people, and they fed themselves in the world, through them. But rather, the people are with the kings (rulers) in the world except for the one Protected by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. So this is the first of the four.</p>
<p>ورجل سمع من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله شيئا فلم يحفظه على وجهه ووهم فيه ولم يتعمد كذبا وهو في يده يرويه ويعمل به ويقول: (أنا سمعته من رسول الله). فلو علم المسلمون أنه وهم لم يقبلوا، ولو علم هو أنه وهم فيه لرفضه.</p>
<p>And a man who heard something from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. He did not memorise it on its perspective, and is unsure about it, and it is not his intention to lie, and it is with him that he is reporting and acting upon, and he is saying, ‘I heard it from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. Had the Muslims come to know that he is not sure, they would not accept it, and if he himself came to know that it is uncertain, he would reject it.</p>
<p>ورجل ثالث سمع من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله شيئا أمر به ثم نهى عنه وهو لا يعلم، أو سمعه نهى عن شيئ ثم أمر به وهو لا يعلم، حفظ المنسوخ ولم يحفظ الناسخ. فلو علم أنه منسوخ لرفضه، ولو علم المسلمون أنه منسوخ إذ سمعوه لرفضوه.</p>
<p>And a third man, he heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> something that he<sup>-saww</sup> ordered and then forbade it and he did not know about it, or he heard the prohibition about something, but later ordered came (it being permissible) which he did not know. He memorised the abrogated (order) and did not memorise the abrogating (order). If he were to come to know that it has been abrogated, he would reject it, and had the Muslims known that it has been abrogated, which he has heard, they would have rejected it’.</p>
<p>ورجل رابع لم يكذب على الله ولا على رسوله بغضا للكذب وتخوفا من الله وتعظيما لرسوله صلى الله عليه وآله ولم يوهم، بل حفظ ما سمع على وجهه فجاء به كما سمعه ولم يزد فيه ولم ينقص، وحفظ الناسخ من المنسوخ فعمل بالناسخ ورفض المنسوخ.</p>
<p>And a fourth man who does not lie against Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, nor against His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>, hated the lies and feared Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and revered the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and was never uncertain, but memorised what he heard on its perspective, and came with it as he had heard it. And he never added anything to it and never left anything out, and he memorised the abrogating from the abrogated. He acted upon the abrogating, and rejected the abrogated.</p>
<p>وإن أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ونهيه مثل القرآن، ناسخ ومنسوخ، وعام وخاص، ومحكم ومتشابه. وقد كان يكون من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله الكلام له وجهان: كلام خاص وكلام عام، مثل القرآن، يسمعه من لا يعرف ما عنى الله به ومن عنى به رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p>And that the order of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and his<sup>-saww</sup> Prohibitions are similar to those of the Quran, abrogating and abrogated, and general as well as specific, and decisive and allegorical. And the speech of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had two perspectives – specific speech, and general speech, just like the Quran. He (the listener) heard it but did not understand what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Meant by it, and what the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> meant by it.</p>
<p>وليس كل أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كان يسأله فيفهم، وكان منهم من يسأله ولا يستفهم حتى أن كانوا ليحبون أن يجيئ الطارئ والأعرابي فيسأل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حتى يسمعوا منه. وكنت أدخل على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كل يوم دخلة وفي كل ليلة دخلة، فيخليني فيها أدور معه حيث دار. وقد علم أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أنه لم يكن يصنع ذلك بأحد من الناس غيري. وربما كان ذلك في منزلي يأتيني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، فإذا دخلت عليه في بعض منازله خلا بي وأقام نساءه فلم يبق غيري وغيره. وإذا أتاني للخلوة في بيتي لم تقم من عندنا فاطمة ولا أحد من ابني.</p>
<p>And it was not that all the companions of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> who asked him<sup>-saww</sup>, understood it, and among them were those who did not ask him<sup>-saww</sup> nor did they understand until they preferred and desired that out of need a Bedouin would turn up to ask the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, so that they would also hear (about its explanation). And I<sup>-asws</sup> used to go to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> every day and every night. He<sup>-saww</sup> used to be alone with me<sup>-asws</sup> whenever and wherever I<sup>-asws</sup> was with him<sup>-saww</sup>. And the companions of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> were aware that he<sup>-saww</sup> never did that with anyone from the people apart from myself<sup>-asws</sup>. And sometimes the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> used to come to my<sup>-asws</sup> house. When I<sup>-asws</sup> came to him<sup>-asws</sup> at his<sup>-saww</sup> place, the women would get up and leave, and no one would be there apart from me<sup>-asws</sup> and him<sup>-saww</sup>. And when he<sup>-saww</sup> came to my<sup>-asws</sup> place, neither Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, nor any of my<sup>-asws</sup> sons<sup>-asws</sup> would get up and leave.</p>
<p>وكنت إذا سألته أجابني وإذا سكت أو نفدت مسائلي ابتدأني، فما نزلت عليه آية من القرآن إلا أقرأنيها وأملاها علي، فكتبتها بخطي. ودعا الله أن يفهمني إياها ويحفظني. فما نسيت آية من كتاب الله منذ حفظتها وعلمني تأويلها، فحفظته وأملاه علي فكتبته. وما ترك شيئا علمه الله من حلال وحرام أو أمر ونهي أو طاعة ومعصية كان أو يكون إلى يوم القيامة إلا وقد علمنيه وحفظته ولم أنس منه حرفا واحدا.</p>
<p>And if I<sup>-asws</sup> asked him<sup>-saww</sup>, he<sup>-saww</sup> would answer me<sup>-asws</sup>, and if I<sup>-asws</sup> would be silent or ask no more questions, he<sup>-saww</sup> would take an initiate. There was not a single Verse from the Quran which Came down upon him<sup>-saww</sup> except that he<sup>-saww</sup> read it out to me<sup>-asws</sup> and dictated it to me<sup>-asws</sup>. I<sup>-asws</sup> would write it down by myself<sup>-asws</sup>. And he<sup>-saww</sup> would supplicate to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for me<sup>-asws</sup> that He<sup>-azwj</sup> would Make these to be understood by me<sup>-asws</sup> memorised by me<sup>-asws</sup>. I<sup>-asws</sup> did not forget a single Verse from the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> ever since I<sup>-asws</sup> memorised it, and he<sup>-saww</sup> made known its explanation to me<sup>-asws</sup>. He<sup>-saww</sup> made me<sup>-asws</sup> memorise it and dictated it to me<sup>-asws</sup>. I wrote it down. And I<sup>-asws</sup> did not leave out anything of the Teachings of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> from the Permissible and the Prohibited, or Order or Prohibition, or acts of obedience or disobedience that have happened and will be happening up to the Day of Judgement, except that he<sup>-saww</sup> made it known to me<sup>-asws</sup>, and I<sup>-asws</sup> memorised it and never forgot a single word from it.</p>
<p>ثم وضع يده على صدري ودعا الله أن يملأ قلبي علما وفهما وفقها وحكما ونورا، وأن يعلمني فلا أجهل، وأن يحفظني فلا أنسى.</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-saww</sup> placed his<sup>-saww</sup> hand upon my<sup>-asws</sup> chest and supplicated to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> that He<sup>-azwj</sup> should Fill my<sup>-asws</sup> chest with (Divine) Knowledge, and understanding, and comprehension, and wisdom, and ‘Noor’, and that I<sup>-asws</sup> should know it such that I<sup>-asws</sup> would not be unaware of it, and that I<sup>-asws</sup> should memorise it such that I<sup>-asws</sup> would never forget it.</p>
<p>فقلت له ذات يوم: يا نبي الله، إنك منذ يوم دعوت الله لي بما دعوت لم أنس شيئا مما علمتني، فلم تمليه علي وتأمرني بكتابته؟ أتتخوف علي النسيان؟ فقال: يا أخي، لست أتخوف عليك النسيان ولا الجهل، وقد أخبرني الله أنه قد استجاب لي فيك وفي شركائك الذين يكونون من بعدك.</p>
<p>One day I<sup>-asws</sup> said to him<sup>-saww</sup>: ‘O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, since you<sup>-saww</sup> supplicated to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for me<sup>-asws</sup> by what you<sup>-saww</sup> supplicated, I<sup>-asws</sup> have never forgotten anything from what you<sup>-saww</sup> have made known to me<sup>-asws</sup>, so why do you<sup>-saww</sup> dictate to me<sup>-asws</sup> and order me<sup>-asws</sup> to write it down? Do you fear that I<sup>-asws</sup> would miss it?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, I<sup>-saww</sup> do not fear forgetfulness for you<sup>-asws</sup>, nor fear ignorance, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Informed me<sup>-saww</sup> that He<sup>-saww</sup> has Answered me<sup>-saww</sup> regarding you<sup>-asws</sup> and your<sup>-asws</sup> associates<sup>-asws</sup> who are to be after you<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p><strong><u>الأئمة الأحد عشر عليهم السلام شركاء أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>قلت: يا نبي الله، ومن شركائي؟ قال: الذين قرنهم الله بنفسه وبي معه، الذين قال في حقهم: (يا أيها الذين آمنوا أطيعوا الله وأطيعوا الرسول وأولي الأمر منكم) فإن (خفتم التنازع في شيئ فارجعوه إلى الله وإلى الرسول وإلى أولي الأمر منكم. قلت: يا نبي الله، ومن هم؟ قال: الأوصياء إلى أن يردوا علي حوضي كلهم هاد مهتد لا يضرهم كيد من كادهم ولا خذلان من خذلهم. هم مع القرآن والقرآن معهم، لا يفارقونه ولا يفارقهم. بهم ينصر الله أمتي وبهم يمطرون، ويدفع عنهم بمستجاب دعوتهم.</p>

<p>I<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and who are my<sup>-asws</sup> associates?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘The ones<sup>-asws</sup> whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Made to be in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Proximity and with Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, regarding whom He<sup>-azwj</sup> has Said <strong><em>“[4:59] O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among you; then if you quarrel about anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger”</em></strong>. I<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and who are they?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘The successors<sup>-asws</sup> until they<sup>-asws</sup> come to me<sup>-saww</sup> at the Fountain. All of them<sup>-asws</sup> are Guides and Guided ones<sup>-asws</sup>. Neither will the plots of the plotters harm them<sup>-asws</sup>, nor the betrayal of those that abandon them<sup>-asws</sup>. They<sup>-asws</sup> are with the Quran and the Quran is with them<sup>-asws</sup>. Neither will they separate from it nor will it separate from them<sup>-asws</sup>. It is due to them<sup>-asws</sup> that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Help my<sup>-saww</sup> community, and due to them<sup>-asws</sup> that He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Make it rain, and Remove from them (calamities) due to the Answering of their<sup>-asws</sup> supplications.</p>
<p>فقلت: يا رسول الله، سمهم لي. فقال: ابني هذا – ووضع يده على رأس الحسن عليه السلام – ثم ابني هذا – ووضع يده على رأس الحسين عليه السلام – ثم ابن ابني هذا – ووضع يده على رأس الحسين عليه السلام – ثم ابن له على اسمي، اسمه (محمد) باقر علمي وخازن وحي الله، وسيولد (علي) في حياتك يا أخي، فاقرأه مني السلام. ثم أقبل على الحسين عليه السلام فقال: سيولد لك (محمد بن علي) في حياتك فاقرأه مني السلام. ثم تكملة الاثني عشر إماما من ولدك يا أخي.</p>
<p>So I<sup>-asws</sup> said, ‘O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, name them<sup>-asws</sup> for me<sup>-asws</sup>’. He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘This son of mine<sup>-asws</sup>’ – and he<sup>-saww</sup> placed his<sup>-saww</sup> hand upon the head of Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> – ‘then this son of mine<sup>-saww</sup>’ – and he<sup>-saww</sup> placed his<sup>-saww</sup> hand upon the head of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>’ – then the son of this son of mine<sup>-saww</sup>’ – and placed his<sup>-saww</sup> hand upon the head of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> – ‘then the son of his<sup>-asws</sup> son whose name is Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, his<sup>-asws</sup> name is my<sup>-saww</sup> name (Muhammad), spreader of my<sup>-saww</sup> knowledge and treasurer of the Revelation of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> will come to this (world) during your<sup>-asws</sup> lifetime, my<sup>-saww</sup> brother, so convey my<sup>-saww</sup> greetings to him<sup>-asws</sup>’. Then he<sup>-saww</sup> turned towards Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> and said: ‘Then will come to you<sup>-asws</sup> son (Muhammad Bin Ali<sup>-asws</sup>) in your<sup>-asws</sup> lifetime, so convey my<sup>-saww</sup> greetings to him<sup>-asws</sup>’. Then twelve Imams<sup>-asws</sup> will be completed from your<sup>-asws</sup> sons, O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother’.</p>
<p>فقلت: يا نبي الله، سمهم لي. فسماهم لي رجلا رجلا. منهم – والله يا أخا بني هلال – مهدي هذه الأمة الذي يملأ الأرض قسطا وعدلا كما ملئت ظلما وجورا. والله إني لأعرف جميع من يبايعه بين الركن والمقام وأعرف أسماء الجميع وقبائلهم.</p>
<p>I said, ‘O Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, name them<sup>-asws</sup> for me<sup>-asws</sup>’.

Among them – by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, O brother of the Clan of Hilal-– is the Mahdi<sup>-asws</sup> of this community who will fill the earth with peace and justice just as it would have been filled with injustice and tyranny.

I narrated to both of them<sup>-asws</sup> this Hadith from their<sup>-asws</sup> father<sup>-asws</sup>. They<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Your Hadith is true.

<p>Abaan said, ‘I narrated the whole of this Hadith to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> from Sulaym.

(The Quraish said) The Prophet of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had said that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Honoured us<sup>-asws</sup>, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, and has Chosen us<sup>-asws</sup> and never Chose for us<sup>-asws</sup> the world, and that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has not Gathered for us<sup>-asws</sup> the Prophet-hood and the Caliphate’. Four of them testified to that – Umar, and Abu Ubeyda, and Ma’az Biin Jabal, and Salim Mowla Abu Huzeyfa. They confused the people who ratified them and turned them on their backs, and took it (Caliphate) out from its origin (Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>) from where Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Made it to be. And they argued against the Helpers of our<sup>-asws</sup> rights and our<sup>-asws</sup> arguments. They pacified them to Abu Bakr. Then Abu Bakr returned it (Caliphate) to Umar, thereby paying him back by it.</p>
<p><strong><u>الشورى لعثمان </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم جعلها عمر شورى بين ستة، فقلدوها عبد الرحمن. ثم جعلها ابن عوف لعثمان على أن يردها عليه، فغدر به عثمان وأظهر ابن عوف كفره وجهله وطعن عليه في حياته وزعم ولده أن عثمان سمه فمات.</p>

<p>Then Umar established a ‘Shura’<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> consisting of six persons (in the matter of Caliphate). They collared it on Abdul Rahman. Then Ibn Awf (Abdul Rahman) made it (Caliphate) to go to Usman on the condition that he would return it back to him. Usman betrayed him, and Ibn Awf (Abdul Rahman) slandered him as an infidel and an ignorant one during his lifetime. His children (Abdul Rahman’s) thought that Usman had poisoned him, which (led to his) death.</p>
<p><strong><u>حروب الجمل وصفين والنهروان </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم قام طلحة والزبير فبايعا عليا عليه السلام طائعين غير مكرهين. ثم نكثا وغدرا، ثم ذهبا بعائشة معهما إلى البصرة مطالبة بدم عثمان. ثم دعا معاوية طغاة أهل الشام إلى الطلب بدم عثمان ونصب لنا الحرب. ثم خالفه أهل حروراء على أن يحكم بكتاب الله وسنة نبيه، فلو كانا حكما بما اشترط عليهما لحكما أن عليا عليه السلام أمير المؤمنين في كتاب الله وعلى لسان نبيه وفي سنته، فخالفه أهل النهروان وقاتلوه.</p>

<p>Then Talha and Zubayr made a stand (in the hope of getting a share in Caliphate). Initially, they paid allegiance to Amir-ul-Momineen which was (as per their will) and without being compelled. Then they broke it and betrayed, then they both went with Aisha to Al-Basra seeking (to avenge) the blood of Usman. Then Muawiya called upon the tyrants of Al-Shaam to seek (avenging) the blood of Usman and established a war against us<sup>-asws</sup>. Then the people of Haroura (Kharijites) opposed Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, that he<sup>-asws</sup> should judge in accordance with the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>. If they had stipulated that condition of Judgement to both of them to judge by, then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> would have been Commander of the Faithful in accordance with the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the tongue of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> and his<sup>-saww</sup> Sunnah. However, the people of Naharwaan opposed him<sup>-asws</sup> and fought against him<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>

When he<sup>-asws</sup> did not find helpers, he<sup>-asws</sup> signed a peace treaty with Muawiya and preserved his<sup>-asws</sup> blood, and the blood of the people of his<sup>-asws</sup> Household, and of his<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites, and they were very few in numbers and so remained very little the ‘Haq’ (the Just). Then eighteen thousand of the inhabitants of Al-Kufa paid allegiance to Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>. Then they betrayed him<sup>-asws</sup>. Then he<sup>-asws</sup> went out to them.

<p>And the liars found a place for their lies by drawing close to their governors, and the judges, and the office bearers in every city. Our<sup>-asws</sup> enemies were narrating about their past friends with false and invalid Hadith, and were reporting from us<sup>-asws</sup> what we<sup>-asws</sup> had never said, arguing on their behalf against us<sup>-asws</sup>, and lying from them against us<sup>-asws</sup>, and they drew closer to their governors and their judges by bearing false witness and lying. And that was widespread and frequent during the era of Muawiya, after the martyrdom of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>. They killed the Shiites in every city. They cut off their hands, and their legs, and crucified them on the accusation for believing in their love for us<sup>-asws</sup>, and they cut them off from us<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>

<p>Then the afflictions did not decline in their severity, and in fact increased up to the era of Ibn Ziyad, after the martyrdom of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>. Then Al-Hajjaj came. He killed them (Shiites) for every suspicion and for every accusation, to the extent that it was more beloved to him for a man to be called an Atheist (Zindiq) or a Magian (Majoosi) rather than for him to be known as one of the Shiites of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>1 –</strong> Abaan says that Sulaym said, ‘I saw Ali<sup>-asws</sup> in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> during the Caliphate of Usman, and there was a group which was narrating and discussing the jurisprudence (Permissible and the Prohibited) and the knowledge. They were mentioning the Qureiysh and their virtues, and their being foremost, and their migration and what the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had said regarding their virtues, for example his<sup>-saww</sup> statement: ‘The Imams<sup>-asws</sup> will be from Qureiysh’, and his<sup>-saww</sup> statement: ‘The people should follow the Qureiysh’, and his<sup>-saww</sup> statement: ‘Qureiysh are the Imams<sup>-asws</sup> of the Arabs’, and his<sup>-saww</sup> statement: ‘Do not be prejudicial against the Qureiysh’, and his<sup>-saww</sup> statement: ‘The strength of one man from the Qureiysh is equal to two from others’, and his<sup>-saww</sup> statement: ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will be Angry with the one who angers the Qureiysh’, and his<sup>-saww</sup> statement: ‘One who intends to humiliate the Qureiysh, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Humiliate him’.</p>
<p>وذكروا الأنصار وفضلها وسوابقها ونصرتها وما أثنى الله عليهم في كتابه وما قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فيهم من الفضل. وذكروا ما قال في سعد بن معاذ في جنازته وحنظلة بن الراهب غسيل الملائكة والذي حمته الدبر، حتى لم يدعوا شيئا من فضلهم، فقال كل حي: (منا فلان وفلان).</p>
<p>And they were mentioning the ‘al-Ansar’ (Helpers) and their merits, and their being foremost, and their help, and what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Praised them by in his<sup>-azwj</sup> Book and what the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had said regarding their virtues. And they mentioned what he<sup>-saww</sup> had said regarding Sa’d Bin Ma’az at his funeral, and the (funeral) washing of Hanzala Bin Al-Raahib by the Angels, and the one who was protected at the end, until they had not left anything out from their virtues. And each of them was saying, ‘So and so is from us’.</p>
<p>وقالت قريش: (منا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ومنا حمزة بن عبد المطلب ومنا جعفر ومنا عبيدة بن الحارث وزيد بن حارثة وأبو بكر وعمر وعثمان وسعد وأبو عبيدة وسالم وابن عوف). فلم يدعوا أحدا من الحيين من أهل السابقة إلا سموه.</p>
<p>And the Qureiysh said, ‘From us is the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and from us is Hamza Bin Abdul Muttalib, and from us is Ja’far, and from us is Ubeyda Bin Al-Haaris, and Zayd Bin Haaris, and Abu Bakr and Umar, and Usman and Sa’d, and Abu Ubeyda and Saalim and Ibn Awf. They did not leave out anyone from the two districts (Mecca and Al-Medina) from the previous ones, but they named him.</p>
<p>وفي الحلقة أكثر من مأتي رجل، منهم مسانيد إلى القبلة ومنهم في الحلقة. فكان ممن حفظت من قريش: علي بن أبي طالب صلوات الله عليه وسعد بن أبي وقاص وعبد الرحمن بن عوف والزبير وطلحة وعمار والمقداد وأبو ذر وهاشم بن عتبة وعبد الله بن عمر والحسن والحسين عليهما السلام وابن عباس ومحمد بن أبي بكر وعبد الله بن جعفر وعبيد الله بن العباس،</p>
<p>And in a circle of more than two hundred men, some of whom were facing the Qiblah, and from among them from what I can remember from the Qureiysh were Ali Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and Sa’d Bin Abu Waqaas, and Abdul Rahman Bin Awf, and Al-Zubeyr, and Talha, and Amaar, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Hashim Bin Utba, and Abdullah Bin Umar, and Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, and Ibn Abbas, and Muhammad Bin Abu Bakr, and Abdullah Bin Ja’far, and Ubeydullah Bin Al-Abbas.</p>

<p>وجاء أبو الحسن البصري ومعه ابنه الحسن غلام أمرد صبيح الوجه معتدل القامة. قال: فجعلت أنظر إليه وإلى عبد الرحمن بن أبي ليلى، فلا أدري أيهما أجمل، غير أن الحسن أعظمهما وأطولهما. فأكثر القوم، وذلك من بكرة إلى حين الزوال – وعثمان في داره لا يعلم بشيئ مما هم فيه – وعلي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام ساكت لا ينطق هو ولا أحد من أهل بيته.</p>
<p>And Abu Al-Hassan Al-Basry came and with him was his son Al-Hassan, a young boy not yet having a beard and of a bright face and moderate stature. I went and looked at him and at Abdul Rhman Bin Abu Layli. I could not make out who was more handsome of them, apart from the fact that Al-Hassan was bigger and taller. There were a lot of people, and that was from the morning up to the mid day – and Usman was in his house, not knowing anything from what they were doing – and Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> remained silent.

<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘With Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as your Witness, do you know that I<sup>-asws</sup> said to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> during the expedition of ‘Tabuk’: ‘Why did you<sup>-saww</sup> leave me<sup>-asws</sup> behind?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Al-Medina cannot be in a suitable state except by myself<sup>-saww</sup> or by you<sup>-asws</sup> (being there) and you<sup>-asws</sup> are unto me<sup>-saww</sup> of the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>-as</sup> except that there will be no Prophet<sup>-as</sup> after me<sup>-saww</sup>?’ They said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes’.</p>
<p>قال: أنشدكم الله، أتعلمون أن الله أنزل في سورة الحج: (يا أيها الذين آمنوا اركعوا واسجدوا واعبدوا ربكم وافعلوا الخير لعلكم تفلحون وجاهدوا في الله حق جهاده هو اجتباكم وما جعل عليكم في الدين من حرج ملة أبيكم إبراهيم هو سماكم المسلمين من قبل وفي هذا ليكون الرسول شهيدا عليكم وتكونوا شهداء على الناس، فأقيموا الصلاة وآتوا الزكاة واعتصموا بالله هو مولاكم فنعم المولى ونعم النصير). فقام سلمان فقال: يا رسول الله، من هؤلاء الذين أنت عليهم شهيد وهم شهداء على الناس، الذين اجتباهم الله ولم يجعل عليهم في الدين من حرج، ملة أبيهم إبراهيم؟ قال: عنى بذلك ثلاثة عشر رجلا خاصة دون هذه الأمة. قال سلمان: بينهم لنا يا رسول الله؟ فقال: (أنا وأخي وأحد عشر من ولدي). قالوا: اللهم نعم.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘With Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as your Witness, do you know that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Revealed in the Chapter ‘The Pilgrimage’ (Surah Al-Hajj): <strong><em>“[22:77] O you who believe! bow down and prostrate yourselves and serve your Lord, and do good that you may succeed. [22:78] And strive hard in (the way of) Allah, (such) a striving a is due to Him; He has chosen you and has not laid upon you an hardship in religion; the faith of your father Ibrahim; He named you Muslims before and in this, that the Messenger may be a bearer of witness to you, and you may be bearers of witness to the people; therefore keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and hold fast by Allah; He is your Guardian; how excellent the Guardian and how excellent the Helper!”</em>, </strong>so Salman<sup>-ra</sup> stood up and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, who are the ones<sup>-asws</sup> upon whom you<sup>-saww</sup> are a witness and they<sup>-asws</sup> are witness upon the people, whom<sup>-asws</sup> Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Chosen, and did not Make in their Religion any hardship, the Creed of their<sup>-asws</sup> father Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup>?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘It means by that thirteen men especially apart from this community’. Salman<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘Introduce them to us, O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup>, and my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup> and eleven from my<sup>-saww</sup> sons<sup>-asws</sup>’. They said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes’.</p>
<p>فقال: أنشدكم الله، أتعلمون أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قام خطيبا ثم لم يخطب بعد ذلك فقال: (يا أيها الناس، إني تارك فيكم الثقلين، كتاب الله وعترتي أهل بيتي. فتمسكوا بهما لن تضلوا، فإن اللطيف الخبير أخبرني وعهد إلي أنهما لن يفترقا حتى يردا علي الحوض). فقام عمر بن الخطاب – وهو شبه المغضب – فقال: يا رسول الله، أكل أهل أهل بيتك؟ قال: (لا، ولكن أوصيائي منهم. أولهم أخي علي ووزيري ووارثي وخليفتي في أمتي وولي كل مؤمن بعدي. هو أولهم، ثم ابني الحسن، ثم ابني الحسين، ثم تسعة من ولد الحسين واحد بعد واحد حتى يردوا علي الحوض. شهداء الله في أرضه وحججه على خلقه وخزان علمه ومعادن حكمته. من أطاعهم أطاع الله ومن عصاهم عصى الله)؟ فقالوا كلهم: نشهد أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قال ذلك.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘With Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as your Witness, do you know that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> stood up to give a sermon, then never gave a sermon after that, so he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O you people! I<sup>-saww</sup> am leaving behind among you two weighty things, Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and my<sup>-saww</sup> Family, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household. So attach yourselves to these two and you will never go astray, for the Kind, the Aware has Informed me<sup>-saww</sup> and Promised to me<sup>-saww</sup> that these two will never separate until they come to me<sup>-saww</sup> at the Fountain’.</p>
<p>Umar Bin Al-Khattab stood up – and he was angry – he said, ‘O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, all the members of your<sup>-saww</sup> Household?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘No, but my<sup>-saww</sup> successors<sup>-asws</sup> from them. The first of them<sup>-asws</sup> being my<sup>-saww</sup> brother Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, my<sup>-saww</sup> Vizier, my<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, my<sup>-saww</sup> Caliph in my<sup>-saww</sup> community and the Guardian of every believer after me<sup>-saww</sup>. He<sup>-asws</sup> is the first of them<sup>-asws</sup>, then my<sup>-saww</sup> son Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, then my<sup>-saww</sup> son Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, then nine from the sons<sup>-asws</sup> of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, one after the other until they return to me<sup>-saww</sup> at the Fountain; witnesses of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> in His<sup>-azwj</sup> earth, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Proofs over His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures, and the treasurers of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Knowledge, and the Mines of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Wisdom. The one who obeys them<sup>-asws</sup> has obeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the one who has disobeyed them<sup>-asws</sup> has disobeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>?’ They all said, ‘We bear witness that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said that’.</p>
<p><strong><u>وصف مجلس المناشدة </u></strong></p>

<p>Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> went further with the questions, so he<sup>-asws</sup> did not leave anything except that he<sup>-asws</sup> made them bear witness to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> with regards to it, and questioned them about it until he<sup>-asws</sup> came to the end of his<sup>-asws</sup> numerous merits, and what Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had said to him<sup>-asws</sup>, all of that was ratified by them and they testified that it was the truth.</p>
<p>قال: فلم يدع شيئا مما أنزل الله فيه خاصة أو فيه وفي أهل بيته في القرآن ولا على لسان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إلا ناشدهم الله فيه. فمنه ما يقولون جميعا: (نعم) ومنه ما يسكت بعضهم ويقول بعضهم: (اللهم نعم) ويقول الذين سكتوا للذين أقروا: أنتم عندنا ثقاة، وقد حدثنا غيركم ممن نثق به أنهم سمعوه من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘He<sup>-asws</sup> did not leave anything from what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Revealed regarding himself<sup>-asws</sup> especially or regarding the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-asws</sup> Household in the Quran, nor on the tongue of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, except that he made them bear witness to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> with regards to it. From them were those who said in unison, ‘Yes’, and from them were those who were silent about some of it and said about some of it, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes’. And the ones who were silent, said to those who had acknowledged it, ‘You all are reliable ones, and other reliable ones have also narrated it as having heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p>ثم قال حين فرغ: اللهم اشهد عليهم. قالوا: اللهم اشهد أنا لم نقل إلا حقا وما قد سمعناه من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، وقد حدثنا من نثق به أنهم سمعوه من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. قال: أتقرون بأن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قال: (من زعم أنه يحبني ويبغض عليا فقد كذب وليس يحبني) – ووضع يده على رأسي – فقال له قائل: وكيف ذاك يا رسول الله؟ قال: (لأنه مني وأنا منه، ومن أحبه فقد أحبني ومن أحبني فقد أحب الله، ومن أبغضه فقد أبغضني ومن أبغضني فقد أبغض الله)؟ فقال نحو من عشرين رجلا من أفاضل الحيين: (اللهم نعم)، وسكت بقيتهم.</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> said when he<sup>-asws</sup> had finished: ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> bear witness upon them’. They said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Be Witness that he<sup>-asws</sup> never related except for the truth, and what we have heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and what has been narrated to us from the reliable ones of what they had heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Do you accept that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘The one who thinks that he loves me<sup>-saww</sup> and hates Ali<sup>-asws</sup> has actually lied and does not love me<sup>-saww</sup>’ – and placed his<sup>-saww</sup> hand upon my<sup>-asws</sup> head – so a questioner said to him<sup>-saww</sup>, ‘And how is that so, O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Because he<sup>-asws</sup> is from me<sup>-saww</sup> and I<sup>-saww</sup> am from him<sup>-asws</sup>, and the one who loves him<sup>-asws</sup> has loved me<sup>-saww</sup> and the one who loves me<sup>-saww</sup> has loved Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who hates him<sup>-asws</sup> has hated me<sup>-saww</sup> and the one who hated me<sup>-saww</sup> has hated Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>?’ Approximately twenty virtuous men from the two groups (Helpers and Emigrants) said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes’, and the rest of them remained silent.</p>
<p>فقال علي عليه السلام للسكوت: ما لكم سكوت؟ فقالوا: هؤلاء الذين شهدوا عندنا ثقاة في صدقهم وفضلهم وسابقتهم. فقال علي عليه السلام: اللهم اشهد عليهم. فقالوا: اللهم إنا لم نشهد ولم نقل إلا ما سمعنا من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وما حدثنا به من نثق به من هؤلاء وغيرهم أنهم سمعوه من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said to the silent ones: ‘What has kept you silent?’ They said, ‘Those who have borne witness are the reliable ones among us regarding their truthfulness, and their virtues, and their precedence’. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> bear witness upon them’. They said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, he<sup>-asws</sup> not borne witness, nor has he<sup>-asws</sup> related except for what we heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and what has been narrated to us by the reliable ones from these and others what they heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 3 * كلمات بين أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام وطلحة سبعة أجوبة عن حديث أبي بكر المختلق في الخلافة </u></strong></p>
<p>فقال طلحة بن عبيد الله – وكان يقال له (داهية قريش) -: فكيف نصنع بما ادعى أبو بكر وعمر وأصحابه الذين صدقوه وشهدوا على مقالته يوم أتوا بك تعتل وفي عنقك حبل، فقالوا لك: (بايع)، فاحتججت بما احتججت به من الفضل والسابقة، فصدقوك جميعا. ثم ادعى أنه سمع نبي الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (إن الله أبى أن يجمع لنا أهل البيت النبوة والخلافة)، فصدقه عمر وأبو عبيدة بن الجراح وسالم ومعاذ بن جبل؟ ثم أقبل طلحة فقال: كل الذي ذكرت وادعيت حق وما احتججت به من السابقة والفضل نحن نقر به ونعرفه، وأما الخلافة فقد شهد أولئك الخمسة بما سمعت الجواب الأول:</p>
<h2 id="3-words-between-amir-ul-momineen-asws-and-talha-seven-answers-to-the-fabricated-hadith-of-abu-bakr-regarding-the-caliphate" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc335145376"></a><a name="_Toc341095433"></a>3 – Words between Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> and Talha – seven answers to the fabricated Hadith of Abu Bakr regarding the Caliphate</h2>
<p>Talha Bin Ubeydullah – and he used to be called ‘the shrewd one of Qureiysh’ – said, ‘What should we make of what Abu Bakr and Umar had claimed and their companions had ratified and testified on their words, the day they brought you<sup>-asws</sup> when (the situation) deteriorated and there was a rope around your<sup>-asws</sup> neck. So they said to you<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘Pay allegiance’. You<sup>-asws</sup> argued with what you<sup>-asws</sup> argued with, from the virtues and the precedence, so they all agreed with you<sup>-asws</sup>. Then he (Abu Bakr) claimed that he had heard from the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> having said that: ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Refused to Gather together for us<sup>-asws</sup> the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, the Prophet-hood and the Caliphate’. This was ratified by Umar, and Abu Ubeyda Bin Al-Jarrah, and Saalim, and Ma’az Bin Jabal?’ Then Talha came forward and said, ‘All that you<sup>-asws</sup> have mentioned and claimed is true, and what you<sup>-asws</sup> have argued by from the precedence and the virtues. We accept it and recognise it, but as for the Caliphate, those five have testified with the answer that you<sup>-asws</sup> have heard before’.</p>
<p><strong><u>فضح تعاهدهم على الصحيفة الملعونة </u></strong></p>
<p>فقام عند ذلك علي عليه السلام – وغضب من مقالة طلحة – فأخرج شيئا قد كان يكتمه وفسر شيئا قد كان قاله يوم مات عمر لم يدروا ما عنى به، وأقبل على طلحة – والناس يسمعون – فقال: يا طلحة، أما والله ما من صحيفة ألقى الله بها يوم القيامة أحب إلي من صحيفة هؤلاء الخمسة الذين تعاهدوا على الوفاء بها في الكعبة في حجة الوداع: (إن قتل الله محمدا أو مات أن يتوازروا ويتظاهروا علي فلا أصل إلى الخلافة)</p>

<p>So Ali<sup>-asws</sup> stood up at that – and he<sup>-asws</sup> was angry from the words of Talha – so he<sup>-asws</sup> took out something which he<sup>-asws</sup> had kept hidden, and explained something about it, and said about the day Umar died, and he (Talha) did not understand what he<sup>-asws</sup> meant by it, and came in front of Talha – and the people were listening – so he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Talha, but by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, there is none from the parchments, that I<sup>-asws</sup> shall meet Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> with, which is more beloved to me<sup>-asws</sup> than the parchment (agreement) of those five who had vowed to remain faithful to it, which they placed in the Kaaba during the farewell Pilgrimage that, ‘If Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Kills Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> or he<sup>-asws</sup> were to pass away, they would collectively plot against me<sup>-asws</sup> so that I<sup>-asws</sup> would never arrive to the Caliphate’.</p>
<p><strong><u>الجواب الثاني: حديث الغدير </u></strong></p>
<p>وقال عليه السلام: والدليل – يا طلحة – على باطل ما شهدوا عليه قول نبي الله صلى الله عليه وآله يوم غدير خم: (من كنت أولى به من نفسه فعلي أولى به من نفسه)، فكيف أكون أولى بهم من أنفسهم وهم أمراء علي وحكام؟</p>

<p>And he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Talha, ‘It is on falsehood what they have testified upon. The words of the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> on the day of Ghadeer Khumm were: ‘The one to whom I<sup>-saww</sup> am higher that his own self, similarly Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is also higher to him than his own self’. So, how can I<sup>-asws</sup> be higher than them than their own selves, whilst they are the Emirs over me<sup>-asws</sup> and rulers?’</p>
<p><strong><u>الجواب الثالث: حديث المنزلة </u></strong></p>

<p>And the words of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>: ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> are unto me<sup>-asws</sup> at the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>-as</sup>, apart from the Prophet-hood’. Do you not know that the Caliphate is other than the Prophet-hood? And had it been together with the Prophet-hood, the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> would have excluded it’.</p>
<p><strong><u>الجواب الرابع: حديث الثقلين </u></strong></p>
<p>وقوله صلى الله عليه وآله: (إني تركت فيكم أمرين لن تضلوا ما تمسكتم بهما كتاب الله وعترتي لا تتقدموهم ولا تتخلفوا عنهم ولا تعلموهم فإنهم أعلم منكم)، فينبغي أن لا يكون الخليفة على الأمة إلا أعلمهم بكتاب الله وسنة نبيه وقد قال الله: (أفمن يهدي إلى الحق أحق أن يتبع أمن لا يهدي إلا أن يهدى فما لكم كيف تحكمون)، وقال: (وزاده بسطة في العلم والجسم)، وقال: أو أثارة من علم إن كنتم صادقين&nbsp; وقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (ما ولت أمة قط أمرها رجلا وفيهم أعلم إلا لم يزل أمرهم يذهب سفالا حتى يرجعوا إلى ما تركوا)، فما الولاية غير الإمارة على الأمة؟</p>
<h2 id="the-fourth-answer-hadith-of-the-two-weighty-things-al-saqalayn" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc335145380"></a><a name="_Toc341095437"></a>The Fourth Answer – Hadith of the Two Weighty Things (Al-Saqalayn)</h2>
<p>And his<sup>-saww</sup> words: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> am leaving among you two matters, you will never go astray if you attach yourselves to them both, Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and my<sup>-saww</sup> Family. Do not be in front of them<sup>-asws</sup>, and do not oppose them<sup>-asws</sup>, and do not (try to) teach them<sup>-asws</sup> for they<sup>-asws</sup> are more knowledgeable than you are’. So it is befitting that none should be the Caliph over the community except for the one who is more knowledgeable than them of the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of its Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Said: <strong><em>“[10:35] Is He then Who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who himself does not go aright unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you; how do you judge?”</em></strong> and Said: <strong><em>“[2:247] and He has increased him abundantly in knowledge and physique,”</em></strong> and Said: <strong><em>“[46:4 or traces of knowledge, if you are truthful.”</em></strong> And the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘No community has ever been ruled by men, despite that there is a more knowledgeable one amongst them, except that its affairs never ceased to deteriorate to the extent that they return to where they had left’. So what is Al-Wilayah apart from the Emirate (ruling) over the community?’</p>
<p><strong><u>الجواب الخامس: حديث التسليم عن علي عليه السلام بإمرة المؤمنين </u></strong></p>

<p>And the consultative group (which Umar nominated for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Caliph) consisted of six in number and all of us are alive. Why did Umar include me<sup>-asws</sup> in the consultation when he and his companions had testified against the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> (by fabricating a Hadith that Prophet-hood and Caliph will not be together)? Did he include me in the consultation regarding the Caliphate or for something else? And if you think that he made the consultation to be for something other than the Emirate, so it is not for Usman to be the Emir over us, and is it necessary for us to have a consultation for something else because he ordered us to have a consultation for something else? And if the consultation was regarding it (Caliphate), why did he include me<sup>-asws</sup> among those (the nominees)? Did he not take me<sup>-asws</sup> out by saying that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had taken out the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household from the Caliphate and informed that there is no share for them<sup>-asws</sup> in it (the fabricated Hadith)?’</p>

<p>And Umar never said it when he called each man separately what he said to his son Abdullah – and here he is – I<sup>-asws</sup> adjure you to solemnly swear by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, what did he say to you when we came out?’ Abdullah (son of Umar) said, ‘But since you have asked me to bear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as a Witness, he said that, ‘If they pay allegiance to the shaved headed one of the Clan of Hashim he<sup>-asws</sup> will lead them to clear arguments and establish them on the Book of their Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of their Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>’. Then he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O son of Umar, What did you say about that?’ He said, ‘I said to him, ‘So what prevents you – O father – from making him<sup>-asws</sup> the Caliph?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘So what did he reply to you?’ He said, ‘He replied to me something that I am concealing’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>قال عليه السلام: فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قد أخبرني بكل ما قال لك وقلت له. قال: ومتى أخبرك؟ قال عليه السلام: أخبرني في حياته ثم أخبرني به ليلة مات أبوك في منامي، ومن رآى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في المنام فقد رآه في اليقظة. قال له ابن عمر: فما أخبرك؟ قال عليه السلام: أنشدك الله يا بن عمر، لئن حدثتك به لتصدقني. قال: أو أسكت قال: فإنه قد قال لك – حين قلت له: (فما يمنعك أن تستخلفه؟) – قال: الصحيفة التي كتبناها بيننا والعهد الذي تعاهدنا عليه في الكعبة في حجة الوداع فسكت ابن عمر فقال: أسألك بحق رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لما أمسكت عني قال سليم: فلقد رأيت ابن عمر في ذلك المجلس وقد خنقته العبرة وعيناه تسيلان دموعا.</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘The Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has informed me<sup>-asws</sup> of everything what he said to you and you said to him’. He (Abdullah ibn Umar) asked, ‘And when did he<sup>-saww</sup> inform you<sup>-asws</sup>?’ Ali<sup>-asws</sup> replied: ‘He<sup>-saww</sup> informed me<sup>-asws</sup> during his<sup>-saww</sup> lifetime, then he<sup>-saww</sup> informed me<sup>-asws</sup> about it on the night your father died, in my<sup>-asws</sup> dream, and the one who sees the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> in the dream, it is as if he has seen him whilst being awake’. Ibn Umar said to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘So what did he inform you<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> hold you to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as a Witness, O son of Umar, if I<sup>-asws</sup> narrate it to you about it, will you ratify me<sup>-asws</sup>?’ Abdullah ibn Umar said, ‘Or I shall remain silent’. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘He (Umar) had said to you, when you said to him, ‘So what prevents you from making him<sup>-asws</sup> the Caliph?’, he said, ‘The parchment (agreement) which we had written stands between us, and the vow that we vowed upon it in the Kaaba during the farewell Pilgrimage’. Ibn Umar was silent. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> ask you, by the right of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, what keeps you silent from (testifying) me<sup>-asws</sup>?’ Sulaym said, ‘I saw Ibn Umar in that gathering, and he was choking on his tears which were flowing’.</p>

<p>ثم أقبل علي عليه السلام على الناس فقال: أخبروني عن منزلتي فيكم وما تعرفوني به، أصدوق أنا عندكم أم كذاب؟ فقالوا: بل صديق صدوق، لا والله ما علمناك كذبت في جاهلية ولا إسلام. قال عليه السلام: فوالله الذي أكرمنا أهل البيت بالنبوة فجعل منا محمدا وأكرمنا من بعده بأن جعلنا أئمة المؤمنين، لا يبلغ عنه صلى الله عليه وآله غيرنا ولا تصلح الإمامة والخلافة إلا فينا، ولم يجعل الله معنا أهل البيت لأحد من الناس فيها نصيبا ولا حقا.</p>

<p>Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> addressed the people. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Inform me<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-asws</sup> status among you, and what you recognise me<sup>-asws</sup> by, am I<sup>-asws</sup> truthful among you or a liar?’ They said, ‘But, you<sup>-asws</sup> sincere truthful one. No, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, we do not know you<sup>-asws</sup> of having lied during the (days of) ignorance nor the (days of) Islam’.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Who has Honoured us<sup>-asws</sup>, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household by the Prophet-hood, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> to be from us<sup>-asws</sup>, and Honoured us<sup>-asws</sup> from after him<sup>-saww</sup> by Making us<sup>-asws</sup> as Imams<sup>-asws</sup> of the believers, none can preach from him<sup>-saww</sup> apart from us<sup>-asws</sup>, nor is the Imamate and the Caliphate correct except within us<sup>-asws</sup>, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> never Made a share in it with us<sup>-asws</sup> for anyone from the people, nor any right for them’.</p>
<p>أما رسول الله، فخاتم النبيين ليس بعده رسول ولا نبي، ختم الأنبياء برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إلى يوم القيامة، وختم بالقرآن الكتب إلى يوم القيامة، وجعلنا من بعد محمد خلفاء في أرضه وشهداء على خلقه وفرض طاعتنا في كتابه وقرننا بنفسه ونبيه في الطاعة في غير آية من القرآن. والله جعل محمدا نبيا وجعلنا خلفاء من بعده في خلقه وشهداء على خلقه وفرض طاعتنا في كتابه المنزل، ثم أمر الله جل وعز نبيه أن يبلغ ذلك أمته، فبلغهم كما أمره الله عز وجل.</p>
<p>But, the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was the last of the Prophets<sup>-as</sup>, there is neither a Rasool<sup>-saww</sup> nor a Nabi<sup>-as</sup> after him<sup>-saww</sup>. The Prophet-hood came to an end with the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> up to the Day of Judgement, and the Books came to an end with the Quran up to the Day of Judgement, and we<sup>-asws</sup> were Made to be after Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> as Caliphs in His<sup>-azwj</sup> earth and as witnesses over His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures, and obedience to us<sup>-asws</sup> has been Made Obligatory in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book and Joined us<sup>-asws</sup> along with Himself<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> regarding the obedience as per the Verse from the Quran. And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Made Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> to be a Prophet and Made us<sup>-asws</sup> to be Caliphs after him<sup>-saww</sup> among His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures, and Made obedience to us<sup>-asws</sup> to be obligatory in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book that Came down, then Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Ordered His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> to preach that to his<sup>-saww</sup> community.

<p>Which of the two is more deserving for the seat of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and of his<sup>-saww</sup> place, and have you heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> when he<sup>-saww</sup> sent me<sup>-asws</sup> with (Surah) Al-Bara’a, so he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘It is not correct for it to be preached except for myself<sup>-saww</sup> or a man<sup>-asws</sup> from me<sup>-saww</sup>? So, I<sup>-asws</sup> hold you to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, did you hear that from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>? They said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes, we testify that we heard that from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> when he<sup>-saww</sup> sent you<sup>-asws</sup> with (Surah) Al-Bara’a’.</p>
<p>قال: فلم يصلح لصاحبكم أن يبلغ عنه صحيفة قدر أربع أصابع ولم يصلح أن يكون المبلغ لها غيري فأيهما أحق بمجلسه ومكانه؟ الذي سماه خاصة أنه من رسول الله أو من خص من بين هذه الأمة أنه ليس من رسول الله؟ ألم يقل النبي صلى الله عليه وآله: ليبلغ الشاهد الغائب؟ فقال طلحة: قد سمعنا ذلك من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، ففسر لنا كيف لا يصلح لأحد.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘So if it was not correct for your companion (Abu Bakr) that he should preach a Parchment the size of four fingers, and it is not correct that it should be preached by anyone apart from me<sup>-asws</sup>. So, which of the two is more deserving with his<sup>-saww</sup> seat and his<sup>-saww</sup> place? The one who was specially named that he<sup>-asws</sup> is from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> or the one who may be considered special within the community but he is not from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>? Did not the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> say: ‘Those who have witnessed it should make it reach to those who are absent?’ Talha said, ‘We have heard that from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, so explain for us, how is it nor correct for anyone else?’</p>
<p>أن يبلغ عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وقد قال لنا ولسائر الناس: (ليبلغ الشاهد منكم الغائب)، وقال بعرفة حين حج حجة الوداع: (رحم الله امرء سمع مقالتي فوعاها ثم أبلغها عني، فرب حامل فقه ولا فقه له ورب حامل فقه إلى من هو أفقه منه، ثلاثة لا يغل عليهن قلب امرء مسلم: إخلاص العمل لله، والسمع والطاعة والمناصحة لولاة الأمر، ولزوم جماعتهم فإن دعوتهم محيطة من ورائهم)، وقام في غير موطن فقال: (ليبلغ الشاهد الغائب)؟</p>
<p>That he should preach from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and he<sup>-saww</sup> has said to us and to the rest of the people: ‘Those who have witnessed it among you should make it reach to the absentees’, and said at Arafaat during the farewell Pilgrimage: ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on the person who heard my<sup>-saww</sup> speech, memorised it and preaches it from me<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>It may be so that the bearer who memorised it has little understanding in it and similarly, a memorizer with better understanding would pass it on to the one who is of higher level than him (in understanding of this Divine Message). Three have no deceit in them – The heart of a Muslim, sincerity in a deed for the sake of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and listening and obedience to the advice of Wali Al-Amr<sup>-asws</sup>, and it is, therefore, necessary that their<sup>-asws</sup> call encompasses all people who are either there or away (from them<sup>-asws</sup>), and Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> stood up with regard to this and said: ‘The ones who witness it should make it reach to those who are absent?’</p>
<p>فقال علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام: إن الذي قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يوم غدير خم ويوم عرفة في حجة الوداع ويوم قبض. فانظر في آخر خطبة خطبها حين قال: (إني قد تركت فيكم أمرين لن تضلوا ما إن تمسكتم بهما، كتاب الله وأهل بيتي. فإن اللطيف الخبير قد عهد إلي أنهما لن يفترقا حتى يردا علي الحوض كهاتين الأصبعين – وأشار بمسبحته والوسطى – فإن إحديهما قدام الأخرى فتمسكوا بهما لا تضلوا ولا تزلوا، ولا تقدموهم ولا تخلفوا عنهم ولا تعلموهم فإنهم أعلم منكم).</p>
<p>So, Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> said that: ‘The Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said on the Day of Ghadeer Khumm, and on the Day of Arafaat during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and on the Day that he<sup>-saww</sup> passed away, therefore look at the last sermon of his<sup>-saww</sup> sermons where he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> have left among you two matter, you will not go astray if you were to attach yourselves to both of them – Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household, for the Kind and the Aware has Promised me<sup>-saww</sup> that these two will never separate until they return to me<sup>-saww</sup> at the Fountain like these two fingers’ – and he<sup>-saww</sup> indicated by his<sup>-saww</sup> index and middle finger – ‘for one of them proceeds the other. Attach yourselves to both of them and neither will you go astray not will you lead (anyone) astray, and do not go ahead of them<sup>-asws</sup>, nor oppose them<sup>-asws</sup>, and do not teach them for they<sup>-asws</sup> are more knowledgeable than you all’.</p>
<p>وإنما أمر العامة أن يبلغوا من لقوا من العامة بإيجاب طاعة الأئمة من آل محمد عليهم السلام وإيجاب حقهم، ولم يقل ذلك في شيئ من الأشياء غير ذلك. وإنما أمر العامة أن يبلغوا العامة بحجة من لا يبلغ عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله جميع ما بعثه الله به غيرهم.</p>
<p>But, rather he<sup>-saww</sup> ordered the general public that they should make this reach to anyone they meet from the general public of the obligation to obey the Imams<sup>-asws</sup> from the Progeny<sup>-asws</sup> of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>, and the obligation of their<sup>-asws</sup> rights, and he<sup>-saww</sup> never said this about a matter from the matters, other than that. But, rather he<sup>-saww</sup> ordered the general public that they should make it reach to others, by the argument that the one who did not make it reach to others from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, had not made reach all of what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent him<sup>-saww</sup> with.</p>
<p>ألا ترى يا طلحة، إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قال لي – وأنتم تسمعون -: يا أخي، إنه لا يقضي عني ديني ولا يبرئ ذمتي غيرك. أنت تبرئ ذمتي وتؤدي أمانتي وتقاتل على سنتي). فلما ولى أبو بكر هل قضى عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله دينه وعداته؟ فأثبتهم جميعا فقضيت دينه وعداته. وأخبرهم أنه لا يقضي عنه دينه وعداته غيري. ولم يكن ما أعطاهم أبو بكر بقضاء لدينه وعداته، وإنما كان قضاي دينه وعداته هو الذي أبرء ذمته وقضى أمانته.</p>
<p>Don’t you see, O Talha, that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said to me<sup>-asws</sup>, and you were listening: ‘O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, none shall fulfil my<sup>-saww</sup> debts, nor take care of my<sup>-saww</sup> responsibilities apart from you<sup>-asws</sup>. You<sup>-asws</sup> will absolve my<sup>-saww</sup> responsibilities, and return the trusts held by me<sup>-saww</sup>, and you<sup>-asws</sup> will fight on my<sup>-saww</sup> Sunnah’.&nbsp; When Abu Bakr became the ruler, did he pay back the debts of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and return the trusts? But I<sup>-asws</sup> dispensed (Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>’s) will all of that. I<sup>-asws</sup> fulfilled his<sup>-saww</sup> debts and his<sup>-saww</sup> trusts. And he<sup>-saww</sup> had informed them that no one apart from me<sup>-asws</sup> will be fulfilling his<sup>-saww</sup> debts and his<sup>-saww</sup> trusts. And whatever Abu Bakr did not give to them (anything on behalf of Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>), he never paid back his<sup>-saww</sup> debts and nor returned his<sup>-saww</sup> trusts, but the one who paid back his<sup>-saww</sup> debts and returned his<sup>-saww</sup> trusts is the one who absolved him<sup>-saww</sup> from the responsibilities, and returned the entrusted properties.</p>
<p>الأئمة عليهم السلام هم مبلغوا أوامر الله إلى الناس وإنما يبلغ عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله جميع ما جاء عن الله عز وجل الأئمة الذين فرض الله طاعتهم في كتابه وأمر بولايتهم، الذين من أطاعهم أطاع الله ومن عصاهم عصى الله.</p>
<p>The (Infallible) Imams<sup>-asws</sup> are the (Divine) preachers, the ones<sup>-asws</sup> about whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Ordered to the people, and they preached from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> all what he<sup>-saww</sup> came with from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic. The Imams<sup>-asws</sup> are the ones<sup>-asws</sup> the obedience to whom has been Made obligatory by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book, and Ordered for their<sup>-asws</sup> Wilayah so that the one who obeys them<sup>-asws</sup> has obeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who has disobeyed them<sup>-asws</sup> has disobeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>’.</p>
<p>فقال طلحة: فرجت عني، ما كنت أدري ما عنى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بذلك حتى فسرته لي. فجزاك الله يا أبا الحسن خيرا عن جميع الأمة.</p>
<p>Talha said, ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> have expounded for me what I used to understand what the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> meant by that, to the extent that you<sup>-asws</sup> have made it easier for me.

<p>(Talha then said) O Abu Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, I would like to ask you<sup>-asws</sup> something about the Quran. I saw you<sup>-asws</sup> coming out with a sealed cloth to them (Abu Bakr and his companions in the Masjid-e-Nabavi). You<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O you people! I<sup>-asws</sup> had been busy in looking after (at the Shahadat of) the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> with matters such as washing him<sup>-saww</sup>, and shrouding him<sup>-saww</sup>, and burying him<sup>-saww</sup>. Then I<sup>-asws</sup> occupied myself<sup>-asws</sup> with the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> until I<sup>-asws</sup> collected (all of) it, so this is the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> collected without a letter missing from it’. I (Talha) have never seen that Book which you<sup>-asws</sup> wrote and composed (where it is?)’.</p>
<p><strong><u>جمع عمر وعثمان للقرآن </u></strong></p>
<p>ولقد رأيت عمر بعث إليك – حين استخلف – أن ابعث به إلي، فأبيت أن تفعل. فدعا عمر الناس، فإذا شهد اثنان على آية قرآن كتبها وما لم يشهد عليها غير رجل واحد رماها ولم يكتبه وقد قال عمر – وأنا أسمع -: (إنه قد قتل يوم اليمامة رجال كانوا يقرؤون قرآنا لا يقرأه غيرهم فذهب)، وقد جاءت شاة إلى صحيفة – وكتاب عمر يكتبون – فأكلتها وذهب ما فيها، والكاتب يومئذ عثمان فما تقولون؟</p>
<h2 id="the-quran-collected-by-umar-and-usman" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc335145388"></a><a name="_Toc341095445"></a>The Quran collected by Umar and Usman</h2>
<p>And I (Talha) have seen Umar, when he became the Caliph, sent someone to you<sup>-asws</sup> that you<sup>-asws</sup> should send it (the Quran) to him. You<sup>-asws</sup> refused to do it. Umar called the people, so when two people bore witness to a Verse of the Quran, he would write it down, and what no more than one person bore witness to, he threw it out and he did not get it written, and Umar said – and I was listening: ‘On the Day of Yamama (a battle), men who would recite of the Quran (who had memorised it) were killed, and what they did not recite has been lost’. And a goat came to the Parchment and ate it – which Umar had made them (people) to write down, and what was in it had been lost, and the Book today written by Usman, what do you<sup>-asws</sup> say about it?</p>
<p>وسمعت عمر يقول وأصحابه الذين ألفوا ما كتبوا على عهد عثمان: (إن الأحزاب كانت تعدل سورة البقرة، والنور ستون ومائة آية، والحجرات تسعون آية) فما هذا؟ وما يمنعك – يرحمك الله – أن تخرج إليهم ما قد ألفت للناس؟ وقد شهدت عثمان حين أخذ ما ألف عمر فجمع له الكتاب وحمل الناس على قراءة واحدة ومزق مصحف أبي بن كعب وابن مسعود وأحرقهما بالنار. فما هذا؟</p>
<p>And I (Talha) heard Umar say, as well as his companions who composed it in the era of Usman that, ‘Al-Ahzaab (Chapter 33) was equal to Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2)<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>, and Al-Noor (Chapter 24) had one hundred and sixty Verses, and Al-Hujuraat (Chapter 49) had ninety Verses, so what is this? And what prevented you<sup>-asws</sup> – may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on you<sup>-asws</sup> – to bring out to the people what you<sup>-asws</sup> had composed? And I witnessed Usman when he took what Umar had composed, so he composed the Book and made the people agree over one recitation and ripped the Parchments of Ubay Bin Ka’ab and Ibn Mas’ood and burnt both of these in the fire. So what is this?’</p>
<p><strong><u>إملاء رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله للقرآن على أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام </u></strong></p>

<p>قال طلحة: كل شيئ من صغير أو كبير أو خاص أو عام، كان أو يكون إلى يوم القيامة فهو مكتوب عندك؟ قال: نعم، وسوى ذلك أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أسر إلي في مرضه مفتاح ألف باب من العلم يفتح كل باب ألف باب. ولو أن الأمة منذ قبض الله نبيه اتبعوني وأطاعوني لأكلوا من فوقهم ومن تحت أرجلهم رغدا إلى يوم القيامة.</p>
<p>Talha said, ‘All things, small or great, or specific or general, has occurred and will be (happening) up to the Day of Judgement, so it is written, and is in your<sup>-asws</sup> possession?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Yes, and that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> divulged a secret to me<sup>-asws</sup> during his<sup>-saww</sup> illness, which opened a thousand doors of the knowledge, each of the doors opened to a thousand (further) doors. And had the community, since Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Captured His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, had followed me<sup>-asws</sup>, and had obeyed me<sup>-asws</sup>, they would have eaten (sustenance) from above them and from under their feet, plentifully, up to the Day of Judgement’.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>

<p>O Talha, are you not a witness to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> when he<sup>-saww</sup> called for a piece of ‘paper’ (cloth/parchment) so that he<sup>-saww</sup> would write on it what will ensure that the community will neither go astray not will it have differences, so your companion (Umar) said what he said, ‘That the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is deranged’. So the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> became angry, then left it?’ He said, ‘Yes, I have witnessed that’. When you all left, the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> informed me<sup>-asws</sup> of that which he<sup>-saww</sup> had intended to write on that, and make the community a witness to it. Jibraeel<sup>-as</sup> informed him<sup>-saww</sup> that, ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Knowledge of the differences of the community and the sects’. Then he<sup>-saww</sup> called for a Parchment, and dictated to me<sup>-asws</sup> what he<sup>-saww</sup> wanted to write on the ‘paper’ (earlier) and got a group of three to bear witness to that – Slaman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and named the ones<sup>-asws</sup> who are to be the Imams<sup>-asws</sup> of guidance, the obedience to whom<sup>-asws</sup> Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Ordered, up to the Day of Judgement’.</p>
<p>فسماني أولهم ثم ابني هذا – وأدنى بيده إلى الحسن – ثم الحسين ثم تسعة من ولد ابني هذا – يعني الحسين -. كذلك كان يا أبا ذر وأنت يا مقداد؟ فقاموا وقالوا: نشهد بذلك على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فقال طلحة: والله لقد سمعت من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول لأبي ذر: (ما أظلت الخضراء ولا أقلت الغبراء على ذي لهجة أصدق من أبي ذر ولا أبر عند الله)، وأنا أشهد أنهما لم يشهدا إلا على حق، ولأنت أصدق وآثر عندي منهما.</p>
<p>So he<sup>-saww</sup> named me<sup>-asws</sup> first, then this son<sup>-asws</sup> of mine<sup>-asws</sup> – and lowered his<sup>-asws</sup> hand on Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> – ‘then Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, then nine from the sons<sup>-asws</sup> of this son<sup>-asws</sup> of mine<sup>-asws</sup>’ – meaning Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>. It was like that, O Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and you, O Miqdad?’ They stood up and said, ‘We bear witness to that on the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. Talha said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I have heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying to Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>: ‘None has been shaded by the green (sky) nor carried by the dusty (ground) who has a truer tone than Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, nor a kinder person with Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>’, and I bear witness that he<sup>-ra</sup> has not testified except on the truth, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are more truthful and more preferable with me than these two<sup>-ra</sup>’.</p>
<p>ثم أقبل عليه السلام على طلحة فقال: إتق الله يا طلحة وأنت يا زبير وأنت يا سعد وأنت يا بن عوف، اتقوا الله وآثروا رضاه واختاروا ما عنده ولا تخافوا في الله لومة لائم.</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> turned to Talha. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Fear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, O Talha, and you O Zubeyr, and you O Sa’ad, and you O Ibn Awf, fear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and opt for His<sup>-azwj</sup> Pleasure and what He<sup>-azwj</sup> has Chosen from Himself<sup>-azwj</sup> and do not fear the accusation of the accuser’.</p>

<p>Talha said, ‘What is your<sup>-asws</sup> opinion – O Abu Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> – answer me<sup>-asws</sup> to what I have asked you about the matter of the Quran, will you<sup>-asws</sup> be displaying it to the people?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Talha, I<sup>-asws</sup> intentionally held back from answering you’. He said, ‘So inform me of what was written by Umar and Usman, is it all the Quran, or there is in it which is not the Quran?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said, ‘But rather, all of it is the Quran.

<p>فقال طلحة: حسبي، أما إذا كان قرآنا فحسبي. ثم قال طلحة: فأخبرني عما في يديك من القرآن وتأويله وعلم الحلال والحرام، إلى من تدفعه ومن صاحبه بعدك؟ قال عليه السلام: إلى الذي أمرني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أن أدفعه إليه. قال: من هو؟ قال: وصيي وأولى الناس بالناس بعدي، ابني هذا الحسن، ثم يدفعه ابني الحسن عند موته إلى ابني هذا الحسين، ثم يصير إلى واحد بعد واحد من ولد الحسين، حتى يرد آخرهم على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حوضه. وهم مع القرآن والقرآن معهم، لا يفارقونه ولا يفارقهم.</p>
<p>Talha said, ‘It is sufficient if it is the Quran, so it is sufficient for me’. Then Talha said, ‘So, inform me about the Quran which is in your<sup>-asws</sup> hands, and its explanation, and the knowledge of the Permissible and the prohibited, to whom will you<sup>-asws</sup> be handing it over to, and who is your<sup>-asws</sup> companion after you<sup>-asws</sup>?’</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘To the one<sup>-asws</sup> the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has ordered me<sup>-asws</sup> to hand it over to him<sup>-asws</sup>’.

<p><strong>خطبة أمير المؤمنين (ع) في السنة الأخيرة من عمره المبارك</strong></p>

<p>أبان عن سليم قال: كنا جلوسا حول أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام وعنده جماعة من أصحابه، فقال له قائل: يا أمير المؤمنين، لو استنفرت الناس. فقام وخطب فقال: ألا إني قد استنفرتكم فلم تنفروا ونصحتكم فلم تقبلوا، ودعوتكم فلم تسمعوا.</p>
<p>Abaan reports that Sulaym said, ‘I was seated around Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> and in his<sup>-asws</sup> presence was a group of his<sup>-asws</sup> companions. Someone said to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, if only you<sup>-asws</sup> had mobilised the people (for Jihad)’. So he<sup>-asws</sup> stood up and gave a sermon.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Nay, I<sup>-asws</sup> had mobilised you but you never got mobilised, and I<sup>-asws</sup> advised you but you never accepted it, and I<sup>-asws</sup> called you but you never listened.</p>
<p>فأنتم شهود كغياب وأحياء كأموات وصم ذوو أسماع، أتلو عليكم الحكمة وأعظكم بالموعظة الشافية الكافية وأحثكم على الجهاد لأهل الجور، فما آتي على آخر كلامي حتى أراكم متفرقين حلقا شتى، تتناشدون الأشعار وتضربون الأمثال وتسألون عن سعر التمر واللبن تبت أيديكم، لقد سئمتم الحرب والاستعداد لها، وأصبحت قلوبكم فارغة من ذكرها، شغلتموها بالأباطيل والأضاليل والأعاليل.</p>
<p>So, you are present as if you are absent, and living as if you are dead, and deaf despite having ears. I<sup>-asws</sup> preach to you the wisdom and preach to you with a preaching which is a sufficient healing, and I<sup>-asws</sup> urge you towards the Holy War against the people of oppression. I<sup>-asws</sup> do not reach to the end of my<sup>-asws</sup> speech and I<sup>-asws</sup> see you are dispersing in groups. You are reciting the poetry and striking the examples, and asking about the price of the dates and the milk. May your hands be broken. You have got bored of the war and the preparation for it, and your hearts are empty and you have stopped mentioning it. You have busied yourselves with the invalidities and the vanities and the excuses.</p>
<p>ويحكم، أغزوهم قبل أن يغزوكم، فوالله ما غزي قوم قط في عقر دارهم إلا ذلوا. وأيم الله ما أظن أن تفعلوا حتى يفعلوا ثم وددت أني قد رأيتهم فلقيت الله على بصيرتي ويقيني واسترحت من مقاساتكم ومن ممارستكم. فما أنتم إلا كإبل جمة ضل راعيها، فكلما ضمت من جانب انتشرت من جانب. كأني بكم والله فيما أرى، لو قد حمس الوغى واستحر الموت قد انفرجتم عن علي بن أبي طالب انفراج الرأس وانفراج المرأة عن ولدها لا تمنع يد لامس.</p>
<p>Woe be unto you, fight against them before they fight against you, for by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, no community was fought in its own houses except that they were humiliated. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> don’t think that you will do it until they do it, then I<sup>-asws</sup> wish, I<sup>-asws</sup> had seen them. So I<sup>-asws</sup> will meet Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> on my<sup>-asws</sup> insight and my<sup>-asws</sup> conviction and be at rest from your sufferings and your practices. You are nothing but like camels whose shepherd has strayed, so if all of you are gathered on one side, you spread out from the other side. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, from what I<sup>-asws</sup> can see, if war is encouraged and the death is intensified, you have broken away from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> like the breaking away of the head which parts the body, like the woman giving birth desires the child (inside) leaves her sooner and does not prevent the hand which touches it.</p>
<p><strong><u>لما ذا لم يفعل أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام ما فعل عثمان من السكوت؟ </u></strong></p>
<p>قال الأشعث بن قيس الكندي: فهلا فعلت كما فعل ابن عفان؟ فقال علي عليه السلام: يا عرف النار، أو كما فعل ابن عفان رأيتموني فعلت؟ أنا عائذ بالله من شر ما تقول، يا بن قيس، والله إن الذي فعل ابن عفان لمخزاة لمن لا دين له ولا الحق في يده، فكيف أفعل ذلك وأنا على بينة من ربي وحجته في يدي والحق معي؟ والله إن امرء مكن عدوه من نفسه حتى يجز لحمه ويفري جلده ويهشم عظمه ويسفك دمه وهو يقدر على أن يمنعه لعظيم وزره وضعيف ما ضمت عليه جوانح صدره. فكن أنت ذلك يا بن قيس فأما أنا فدون – والله – أن أعطي بيدي ضرب بالمشرفي تطير له فراش الهام وتطيح منه الكف والمعصم ويفعل الله بعد ما يشاء.</p>

<p>Al-Ash’as Bin Qays Al-Kindi said, ‘Why did you<sup>-asws</sup> not do what Ibn Affan did?’ Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O one who is known to the Fire, do you see me doing what Ibn Affan did? I<sup>-asws</sup> seek Refuge in Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> from the evil of what you are saying, O Ibn Qays. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, that which Ibn Affan did, does not even befit the one who has no religion to him, nor truth in his hands.</p>
<p>So, how can I<sup>-asws</sup> do that and I<sup>-asws</sup> am on the clear evidence from my<sup>-asws</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, and Proofs in my<sup>-asws</sup> hand, and the truth is with me<sup>-asws</sup>? By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, the man who strengthens his enemy over himself until he cuts his flesh, and rips his skin, and breaks his bones, and spills his blood whilst he had the ability to prevent it, has a great sin upon him, and weak are the wings of his chest. So you are like that, O Ibn Qays. As for myself<sup>-asws</sup>, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if I<sup>-asws</sup> come with my<sup>-asws</sup> hands and strike them by my<sup>-asws</sup> honourable (sword), the important seats will be overthrown and from it hands and wrists will be cut off, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Do what He<sup>-azwj</sup> so Desires to.</p>
<p>ويلك يا بن قيس، المؤمن يموت بكل موتة غير أنه لا يقتل نفسه، فمن قدر على حقن دمه ثم خلا بينه وبين قاتله فهو قاتل نفسه.</p>
<p>Woe be unto you, O Ibn Qays, a believer dies of every (kind of) death apart from that he does not kill himself (suicide). Therefore, the one who has the ability of saving his own blood, then leaves opportunity between himself and his killer, so he has killed himself.</p>
<p>ويلك يا بن قيس، إن هذه الأمة تفترق على ثلاث وسبعين فرقة، فرقة واحدة منها في الجنة واثنتان وسبعون في النار. وشرها وأبغضها إلى الله وأبعدها منه السامرة الذين يقولون: (لا قتال)، وكذبوا. قد أمر الله عز وجل بقتال هؤلاء الباغين في كتابه وسنة نبيه وكذلك المارقة.</p>
<p>Woe be unto you, O ibn Qays. This community will divide into seventy-three (73)sects. One sect from it will be in the Paradise, and seventy-two (72) will be in the Fire. And the worst ones of it, and the most abhorrent ones of it to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the most distant ones from it are the ones who are saying, ‘Do not fight them’, and they are liars. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Ordered for the killing of these rebels, in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book, and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and similar is the case for the renegades.</p>
<p><strong><u>لما ذا لم يقم أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام بالسيف في قضايا السقيفة </u></strong></p>

<p>Ash’as Bin Qays said that he was angered from his<sup>-asws</sup> words – : ‘So, what prevented you<sup>-asws</sup>, O Ibn Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, when allegiances were given to the brother of Taym Bin Marat (Abu Bakr), and the brother of the Clan of Udayy Bin Ka’ab (Umar), and the brother of the Clan of Umayya (Usman) after these two, to fight and strike by the sword? And you<sup>-asws</sup> have never preached us with a sermon – since you<sup>-asws</sup> came to Al-Iraq – except that you<sup>-asws</sup> have said in it, before you<sup>-asws</sup> came down from your<sup>-asws</sup> Pulpit: ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> am the highest of the people than the people themselves, and I<sup>-asws</sup> have not ceased to be an oppressed one since Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Captured Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>’. So what prevented you<sup>-asws</sup> to strike by your<sup>-asws</sup> sword to do away with being oppressed?’</p>
<p>فقال له علي عليه السلام: يا بن قيس، قلت فاسمع الجواب: لم يمنعني من ذلك الجبن ولا كراهية للقاء ربي، وأن لا أكون أعلم أن ما عند الله خير لي من الدنيا والبقاء فيها، ولكن منعني من ذلك أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وعهده إلي. أخبرني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بما الأمة صانعة بي بعده، فلم أك بما صنعوا – حين عاينته – بأعلم مني ولا أشد يقينا مني به قبل ذلك، بل أنا بقول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أشد يقينا مني بما عاينت وشهدت. فقلت: يا رسول الله، فما تعهد إلي إذا كان ذلك؟ قال: إن وجدت أعوانا فانبذ إليهم وجاهدهم، وإن لم تجد أعوانا فاكفف يدك واحقن دمك حتى تجد على إقامة الدين وكتاب الله وسنتي أعوانا.</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said to him: ‘O Ibn Qays, you have said, so now listen to the answer. Neither was it the cowardice that prevented me<sup>-asws</sup> nor was it abhorrence of meeting my<sup>-asws</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, and it was not the knowledge that what is with Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is better for me<sup>-asws</sup> than the words and what remains within it, but what prevented me<sup>-asws</sup> from that was the order of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and his<sup>-saww</sup> oath to me<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> informed me<sup>-asws</sup> of what the community will be plotting against me<sup>-asws</sup> after him<sup>-saww</sup>. There was none more knowledgeable than myself<sup>-asws</sup> of what they were going to do – when I<sup>-asws</sup> saw it with my<sup>-asws</sup> own eyes – and more intensely convinced than myself<sup>-asws</sup> about it even before that, but I<sup>-asws</sup> had more conviction on the words of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> than what I<sup>-asws</sup> saw with my<sup>-asws</sup> own eyes and witnessed. I<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, so what is your<sup>-saww</sup> oath to me<sup>-asws</sup>, if that were to happen?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘If you<sup>-asws</sup> find helpers, then reject them and struggle against them, and if you<sup>-asws</sup> do not find helpers, hold back your<sup>-asws</sup> hand and save your<sup>-asws</sup> blood, and until such time as you<sup>-asws</sup> find helpers for the Establishment of the Religion, and the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Sunnah’.</p>
<p>وأخبرني صلى الله عليه وآله أن الأمة ستخذلني وتبايع غيري وتتبع غيري. وأخبرني صلى الله عليه وآله أني منه بمنزلة هارون من موسى، وأن الأمة سيصيرون من بعده بمنزلة هارون ومن تبعه والعجل ومن تبعه، إذ قال له موسى: (يا هارون، ما منعك إذ رأيتهم ضلوا ألا تتبعن أفعصيت أمري قال يا بن أم إن القوم استضعفوني وكادوا يقتلونني)، وقال: (يا بن أم لا تأخذ بلحيتي ولا برأسي، إني خشيت أن تقول فرقت بين بني إسرائيل ولم ترقب قولي).</p>
<p>And he<sup>-saww</sup> informed me<sup>-asws</sup> that the community will be abandoning me<sup>-asws</sup> and will pay allegiance to someone else and follow him. And he<sup>-saww</sup> informed me<sup>-asws</sup> that I<sup>-asws</sup> am to him<sup>-saww</sup> at the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>-as</sup>, and that the community will end up becoming, after him<sup>-saww</sup>, in a similar position that Haroun<sup>-as</sup> faced and the ones that followed him<sup>-as</sup>, and the calf and the ones that followed it, when Musa<sup>-as</sup> said to him<sup>-as</sup>: ‘O Haroun<sup>-as</sup>, what prevented you<sup>-as</sup>, when you<sup>-as</sup> saw them going astray and disobeying my<sup>-as</sup> orders?’ He<sup>-as</sup> said <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[7:150] Son of my mother! Lo! the folk did judge me as weak and almost killed me.”</em></strong>, and said: ‘Do not hold me<sup>-as</sup> by my<sup>-as</sup> beard and my<sup>-as</sup> head, I<sup>-asws</sup> was afraid to tell the dispersed ones of the Children of Israel, and they did not wait for my<sup>-as</sup> words’.</p>
<p>وإنما يعني: إن موسى أمر هارون – حين استخلفه عليهم – إن ضلوا فوجد أعوانا أن يجاهدهم، وإن لم يجد أعوانا أن يكف يده ويحقن دمه ولا يفرق بينهم. وإني خشيت أن يقول لي ذلك أخي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (لم فرقت بين الأمة ولم ترقب قولي وقد عهدت إليك إن لم تجد أعوانا أن تكف يدك وتحقن دمك ودم أهل بيتك وشيعتك)؟</p>
<p>And it means that Musa<sup>-as</sup> ordered Haroun<sup>-as</sup> – when he<sup>-as</sup> made him<sup>-as</sup> to be the Caliph – that when they go astray, so if he<sup>-as</sup> were to find helpers then he<sup>-as</sup> should strive against them, and if he<sup>-as</sup> does not find any helpers then he<sup>-as</sup> should hold back his<sup>-as</sup> hand and save his<sup>-as</sup> blood and not cause friction between them. And I<sup>-asws</sup> am afraid that my<sup>-asws</sup> brother<sup>-saww</sup> the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> would say to me<sup>-asws</sup> that: ‘Why did you<sup>-asws</sup> create friction between the community and did not heed my<sup>-saww</sup> words and what I<sup>-saww</sup> had covenanted to you<sup>-asws</sup> that if you<sup>-asws</sup> do not find helpers then you<sup>-asws</sup> should hold back your<sup>-asws</sup> hand and save your<sup>-asws</sup> blood, and the blood of the People<sup>-asws</sup> of your<sup>-asws</sup> Household, and your<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites?’</p>
<p><strong><u>إقدام أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام لمحاربة أبي بكر وعمر </u></strong></p>
<p>فلما قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مال الناس إلى أبي بكر فبايعوه وأنا مشغول برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بغسله ودفنه. ثم شغلت بالقرآن، فآليت على نفسي أن لا أرتدي إلا للصلاة حتى أجمعه في كتاب، ففعلت.</p>
<h2 id="steps-taken-by-amir-ul-momineen-asws-to-fight-against-abu-bakr-and-umar" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc335145397"></a><a name="_Toc341095454"></a>Steps taken by Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> to fight against Abu Bakr and Umar</h2>
<p>When the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away, the people turned to Abu Bakr. So they paid allegiance to him, and I<sup>-asws</sup> was preoccupied with the washing and the burial of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. Then I<sup>-asws</sup> occupied myself<sup>-asws</sup> with the Quran. I<sup>-asws</sup> took it upon myself<sup>-asws</sup> that I<sup>-asws</sup> shall not wear (a cloak) except for the Prayer until I<sup>-asws</sup> collect it in a Book. So I<sup>-asws</sup> did that.</p>
<p>ثم حملت فاطمة وأخذت بيد ابني الحسن والحسين، فلم أدع أحدا من أهل بدر وأهل السابقة من المهاجرين والأنصار إلا ناشدتهم الله في حقي ودعوتهم إلى نصرتي. فلم يستجب لي من جميع الناس إلا أربعة رهط: سلمان وأبو ذر والمقداد والزبير، ولم يكن معي أحد من أهل بيتي أصول به ولا أقوى به، أما حمزة فقتل يوم أحد، وأما جعفر فقتل يوم مؤتة، وبقيت بين جلفين جافيين ذليلين حقيرين عاجزين: العباس وعقيل، وكانا قريبي العهد بكفر. فأكرهوني وقهروني، فقلت كما قال هارون لأخيه: (يا بن أم، إن القوم استضعفوني وكادوا يقتلونني). فلي بهارون أسوة حسنة ولي بعهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حجة قوية.</p>
<p>Then I<sup>-asws</sup> got Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> to ride (on a mule), and took my<sup>-asws</sup> sons<sup>-asws</sup> Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> by the hand, and there was none from the people of Badr, and the former ones from the ‘المهاجرين والأنصار’ (Emigrants and the Helpers) except that I<sup>-asws</sup> got them to bear witness to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for my<sup>-asws</sup> rights and called upon them to help me<sup>-asws</sup>. None answered me<sup>-asws</sup> from the whole of the people except for a group of four – Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Zubayr<sup>-asws</sup>, and there was no one with me<sup>-asws</sup> from the people of my<sup>-asws</sup> Household that I<sup>-asws</sup> could attack by or derive strength from. As for Hamza<sup>-ra</sup>, he<sup>-ra</sup> was killed on the Day of Badr, and as for Ja’far<sup>-ra</sup>, he<sup>-ra</sup> was killed on the Day of Mu’ta, and I<sup>-asws</sup> remained in between two weak ones, fearful ones, disgraced ones, lowly ones, helpless ones – Al-Abbas and Aqeel, apart from them all around me had committed to disbelief. So they (Abu Bakr and Umar and the people) forced me<sup>-asws</sup> and overpowered me<sup>-asws</sup>. So I<sup>-asws</sup> said as Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had said to his<sup>-as</sup> brother<sup>-as</sup> (Musa<sup>-as</sup>) <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[7:150] Son of my mother! Lo! the folk did judge me as weak and almost killed me.”</em></strong> So to me<sup>-asws</sup>, with Haroun<sup>-as</sup> was the best example (to give), and for me<sup>-asws</sup> with the oath to me<sup>-asws</sup> of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was a strong argument (to present).</p>
<p>فقال الأشعث: كذلك صنع عثمان، استغاث بالناس ودعاهم إلى نصرته فلم يجد أعوانا فكف يده حتى قتل مظلوما. قال عليه السلام: ويلك يا بن قيس، إن القوم – حين قهروني واستضعفوني وكادوا يقتلونني – لو قالوا لي: (نقتلك البتة) لامتنعت من قتلهم إياي ولو لم أجد غير نفسي وحدي، ولكن قالوا: (إن بايعت كففنا عنك وأكرمناك وقربناك وفضلناك وإن لم تفعل قتلناك). فلما لم أجد أحدا بايعتهم، وبيعتي إياهم لا يحق لهم باطلا ولا يوجب لهم حقا. فلو كان عثمان – حين قال له الناس: (اخلعها ونكف عنك) – خلعها لم يقتلوه، ولكنه قال: (لا أخلعها). قالوا: (فإنا قاتلوك)، فكف يده عنهم حتى قتلوه. ولعمري لخلعه إياها كان خيرا له، لأنه أخذها بغير حق ولم يكن له فيها نصيب وادعى ما ليس له وتناول حق غيره.</p>
<p>Al-Ash’as said, ‘That is what Usman did. He sought help of the people and called them to his help. So when he could not find helpers, he held back his hand until he was killed as an oppressed person. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said; ‘Woe be unto you O Ibn Qays, the people – when they overpowered me<sup>-asws</sup> and considered me<sup>-asws</sup> to be weak, and almost killed me<sup>-asws</sup> – had they said to me<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘We will kill you<sup>-asws</sup> regardless’, I<sup>-asws</sup> would have stopped them from killing me<sup>-asws</sup> even though I<sup>-asws</sup> would not have found anyone (for help) apart from myself<sup>-asws</sup>, but they said to me, ‘If you<sup>-asws</sup> give allegiance, we will hold back our hands from you<sup>-asws</sup>, and will honour you<sup>-asws</sup>, and consider you<sup>-asws</sup> as a near one, and will give you<sup>-asws</sup> preference, and if you<sup>-asws</sup> do not do it, we will kill you<sup>-asws</sup>’. So when I<sup>-asws</sup> did not find anyone (for help) I<sup>-asws</sup> was forced for allegiance, and my<sup>-asws</sup> allegiance to him (that way when he forcefully touched my<sup>-asws</sup> hand) does not make his falsehood to be true nor does it obligate any of his rights (upon me<sup>-asws</sup>). When the people said to Usman, ‘Leave it (Caliphate) and we will hold back from you’, had he left it he would not have been killed, but he said, ‘I will not leave it’.</p>
<p>They said, ‘Therefore we will kill you’. So he held back his hand from them until they killed him. And by my<sup>-asws</sup> life, had he left it, it would have been better for him, because he had grabbed it wrongfully, and there was no share in it for him, and he sought that which was not for him, and had swallowed up somebody else’s right.</p>
<p><strong><u>عثمان أعان على قتل نفسه </u></strong></p>
<p>ويلك يا بن قيس، إن عثمان لا يعدو أن يكون أحد رجلين: إما أن يكون دعا الناس إلى نصرته فلم ينصروه، وإما أن يكون القوم دعوه إلى أن ينصروه فنهاهم عن نصرته، فلم يكن يحل له أن ينهى المسلمين عن أن ينصروا إماما هاديا مهتديا لم يحدث حدثا ولم يؤو محدثا. وبئس ما صنع حين نهاهم وبئس ما صنعوا حين أطاعوه وإما أن يكون جوره وسوء سريرته قضى أنهم لم يروه أهلا لنصرته لجوره وحكمه بخلاف الكتاب والسنة.</p>
<h2 id="usman-helped-in-his-own-killing" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc335145398"></a><a name="_Toc341095455"></a>Usman helped in his own killing</h2>
<p>Woe be unto you, O Ibn Qays, Usman’s position cannot be void of two situations; either he called upon the people for his help but they did not help him, or the people called upon him to offer their help but he prevented them from helping him. So it was not permissible for him to prevent the Muslims to help a guiding Imam<sup>-asws</sup>, who is guided one, and who did neither innovate nor did he ever help an innovator. And it was evil what he did when he prevented them, and evil was what they did (to kill him) after having obeyed him, but it was his oppression and his bad personality that made them judge that he was not deserving of help due to his cruelty and rulings against the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p>وقد كان مع عثمان – من أهل بيته ومواليه وأصحابه – أكثر من أربعة آلاف رجل، ولو شاء أن يمتنع بهم لفعل. فلم نهاهم عن نصرته؟ ولو كنت وجدت يوم بويع أخو تيم تتمة أربعين رجلا مطيعين لي لجاهدتهم، وأما يوم بويع عمر وعثمان فلا، لأني قد كنت بايعت ومثلي لا ينكث بيعته.</p>
<p>And there were with Usman – from his family and friends and companions – more than four thousand men. And had he so desired, he could have refrained by them to do it (killing him). So why did he prevent them from helping him? And had I found, on the day that the allegiance was paid to the brother of Taym (Abu Bakr), forty men obedient to me<sup>-asws</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> would have fought them, and on the day of the allegiance to Umar and Usman. Nay, because I<sup>-asws</sup> was (forced to) pay allegiance, and a person like me<sup>-asws</sup> does not break his allegiance.</p>
<p><strong><u>مواقف أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام في الحروب </u></strong></p>
<p>ويلك يا بن قيس، كيف رأيتني صنعت حين قتل عثمان إذ وجدت أعوانا؟ هل رأيت مني فشلا أو تأخرا أو جبنا أو تقصيرا في وقعتي يوم البصرة وهم حول جملهم. الملعون من معه، الملعون من قتل حوله، الملعون من رجع بعده لا تائبا ولا مستغفرا، فإنهم قتلوا أنصاري ونكثوا بيعتي ومثلوا بعاملي وبغوا علي. وسرت إليهم في اثني عشر ألفا وهم نيف على عشرين ومائة ألف، فنصرني الله عليهم وقتلهم بأيدينا وشفى صدور قوم مؤمنين.</p>

Did you see from me<sup>-asws</sup> any failure, or hesitation, or cowardice, or negligence at what took place on the Day of Al-Basra and they were around their camel? He is the accursed, the one who was with them; the accursed, the one who was killed around it; the accursed, the one who returned after it and did not repent nor sought Forgiveness, for they killed my<sup>-asws</sup> helpers, and broke their allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup>, and mutilated my<sup>-asws</sup> workers, and rebelled against me<sup>-asws</sup>. And I<sup>-asws</sup> went against them and I<sup>-asws</sup> had with me<sup>-asws</sup> twelve thousand (men) and they were just over twenty thousand of them. So, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Helped me<sup>-asws</sup> against them, and got them killed by our hands and healed the chests of the believing people.</p>
<p>وكيف رأيت – يا بن قيس – وقعتنا بصفين وما قتل الله منهم بأيدينا خمسين ألفا في صعيد واحد إلى النار. وكيف رأيتنا يوم النهروان، إذ لقيت المارقين وهم مستمسكون يومئذ بدين الذين ضل سعيهم في الحياة الدنيا وهم يحسبون أنهم يحسنون صنعا؟ فقتلهم الله بأيدينا في صعيد واحد إلى النار لم يبق منهم عشرة ولم يقتلوا من المؤمنين عشرة.</p>
<p>O Ibn Qays, how did you see me<sup>-asws</sup> at the occurrence of Siffeen<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>, and what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Killed from them by our hands, fifty thousand in one place who proceeded to the Fire. And how did you see me<sup>-asws</sup> on the day of Nahrwaan<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>, when I<sup>-asws</sup> met the renegades and they were attaching themselves, on that day, to a religion which strayed them in the life of this world and they were reckoning that they were acting in a good way? So, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Killed them by our hands in one place and they proceeded to the Fire. Not even ten of them remained, and they did not even kill ten of the believers.</p>
<p>ويلك يا بن قيس، هل رأيت لي لواء رد أو راية ردت؟ إياي تعير يا بن قيس؟ وأنا صاحب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في جميع مواطنه ومشاهده والمتقدم إلى الشدائد بين يديه، لا أفر ولا أزول ولا أعيى ولا أنحاز ولا أمنح العدو دبري، لأنه لا ينبغي للنبي ولا للوصي إذا لبس لامته وقصد لعدوه أن يرجع أو ينثني حتى يقتل أو يفتح الله له.</p>
<p>Woe be unto you, O Ibn Qays, did you see me<sup>-asws</sup> turn back or return the flag? Are you taunting me<sup>-asws</sup>, O Ibn Qays? And I<sup>-asws</sup> was the companion of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> in all the places and witnessed it, and I<sup>-asws</sup> advanced in the face of extremities facing him<sup>-saww</sup>. Neither did I<sup>-asws</sup> flee, nor eased off, nor got exhausted, nor aligned myself<sup>-asws</sup> with the enemies, nor turned my<sup>-asws</sup> back on them, because it does not befit for the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> nor for the successor<sup>-asws</sup>, when they<sup>-asws</sup> dress up for battle against the enemies that he<sup>-asws</sup> should turn back or fold (surrender), until he<sup>-asws</sup> is either killed or Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Grants victory to him<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p>لو وجدت أربعين رجلا مثل الأربعة يا بن قيس، هل سمعت لي بفرار قط أو نبوة؟ يا بن قيس، أما والذي فلق الحبة وبرأ النسمة، إني لو وجدت يوم بويع أخو تيم – الذي عيرتني بدخولي في بيعته – أربعين رجلا كلهم على مثل بصيرة الأربعة الذين قد وجدت لما كففت يدي ولناهضت القوم، ولكن لم أجد خامسا فأمسكت.</p>
<p>If only I<sup>-asws</sup> could have found forty men like the four, O Ibn Qays. Have you ever heard for me<sup>-asws</sup> to have fled at all or even hesitate? O Ibn Qays, but by the One<sup>-azwj</sup> Who Split the grain and Created the species, if I<sup>-asws</sup> could have found, on the day the allegiance was paid to the brother of Taym (Abu Bakr) – that which you are taunting me<sup>-asws</sup> with by including me<sup>-asws</sup> in the allegiance to him – forty people, all of whom having the ‘بصيرة’ (knowledge and understanding) of the four which I<sup>-asws</sup> did find, I<sup>-asws</sup> would not have held back my<sup>-asws</sup> hand and would have fought against the people, but I<sup>-asws</sup> could not find even a fifth one, so I<sup>-asws</sup> kept quiet’.</p>
<p>قال الأشعث: فمن الأربعة، يا أمير المؤمنين؟ قال عليه السلام: سلمان وأبو ذر والمقداد والزبير بن صفية قبل نكثه بيعتي، فإنه بايعني مرتين: أما بيعته الأولى التي وفى بها فإنه لما بويع أبو بكر أتاني أربعون رجلا من المهاجرين والأنصار فبايعوني وفيهم الزبير، فأمرتهم أن يصبحوا عند بابي محلقين رؤوسهم عليهم السلاح، فما وفى لي ولا صدقني منهم أحد غير أربعة: سلمان وأبو ذر والمقداد والزبير.</p>
<p>Al-Ash’as said, ‘So who are the four, O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Zubeyr Bin Safiya before he broke his allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup>, for he had paid allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup> twice. As for the first allegiance, he was faithful to it. So when allegiance was paid to Abu Bakr, forty men from the ‘المهاجرين والأنصار’ (Emigrants and the Helpers) came up to me<sup>-asws</sup>. They paid allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Zubayr was among them. So I<sup>-asws</sup> ordered them to be at my<sup>-asws</sup> door in the morning, with their weapons and having shaved off their heads. No one was faithful to me<sup>-asws</sup>, nor ratified me<sup>-asws</sup> from among them anyone except for four – Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Zubyar<sup>-ra</sup>.</p>
<p>وأما بيعته الأخرى إياي، فإنه أتاني هو وصاحبه طلحة بعد ما قتل عثمان فبايعاني طائعين غير مكرهين، ثم رجعا عن دينهما مرتدين ناكثين مكابرين معاندين خاسرين، فقتلهما الله إلى النار. وأما الثلاثة – سلمان وأبو ذر والمقداد – فثبتوا على دين محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وعلى ملة إبراهيم حتى لحقوا بالله يرحمهم الله.</p>
<p>As for his second allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup>, so he came up to me<sup>-asws</sup> along with his companion Talha after the killing of Usman. So he paid allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup> obediently, not grudgingly. Then they turned back from their religion as two apostates, breakers (of allegiance), and stubborn, obstinate, losers. So Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Killed them both and they proceeded to the Fire. And as for the three – Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup> – they were steadfast on the Religion of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>, and on the Creed of Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup> until they met Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on them<sup>-ra</sup>’.</p>
<p>يا بن قيس، والذي فلق الحبة وبرء النسمة، لو أن أولئك الأربعين الذين بايعوا وفوا لي وأصبحوا على بابي محلقين رؤوسهم قبل أن تجب لعتيق في عنقي بيعته لناهضته وحاكمته إلى الله عز وجل. ولو وجدت قبل بيعة عثمان أعوانا لناهضتهم وحاكمتهم إلى الله، فإن ابن عوف جعلها لعثمان واشترط عليه فيما بينه وبينه أن يردها عليه عند موته، وأما بعد بيعتي إياهم فليس إلى مجاهدتهم سبيل.</p>
<p>O Ibna Qays, by the One<sup>-azwj</sup> Who split the grain and Created the species, had those forty of them who had paid allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup> been faithful to me<sup>-asws</sup>, and came up to my<sup>-asws</sup> door with shaved heads, before the allegiance to Ateeq (Abu Bakr) was forced upon my<sup>-asws</sup> neck, I<sup>-asws</sup> would have confronted them, and left their judgement to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic. And had I<sup>-asws</sup> found helpers, before the allegiance to Usman, I<sup>-asws</sup> would have confronted them and left their judgement to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. So, Ibn Awf made it (Caliphate) to go to Usman, and made a deal with him for it to remain between the two of them, and that he shall return it back to him at the time of his death, and after my<sup>-asws</sup> (forced) allegiance to them, there was no way of fighting against them’.</p>
<p><strong><u>الشيعة، النواصب، المستضعفون </u></strong></p>
<p>فقال الأشعث: والله لئن كان الأمر كما تقول لقد هلكت أمة محمد صلى الله عليه وآله غيرك وغير شيعتك. فقال له علي عليه السلام: فإن الحق والله معي يا بن قيس كما أقول. وما هلك من الأمة إلا الناصبون والناكثون والمكابرون والجاحدون والمعاندون، فأما من تمسك بالتوحيد والإقرار بمحمد صلى الله عليه وآله والإسلام ولم يخرج من الملة ولم يظاهر علينا الظلمة ولم ينصب لنا العداوة وشك في الخلافة ولم يعرف أهلها وولاتها ولم يعرف لنا ولاية ولم ينصب لنا عداوة، فإن ذلك مسلم مستضعف يرجى له رحمة الله ويتخوف عليه ذنوبه.</p>

<p>Al-Ash’as said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if the matter is as you<sup>-asws</sup> are saying, the community of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> will be destroyed apart from you<sup>-asws</sup> and your<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites’.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said to him: ‘As for the truth, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, it is with me<sup>-asws</sup>, O Ibn Qays, as I<sup>-asws</sup> have said. And none from the community will perish except for the Nasibis, and the Breakers (of the allegiance), and the stubborn, and the deniers, and the obstinate ones. So, as for the one who adheres to the Oneness (Al-Tawheed), and accepts Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>, and the Islam, and does not exit from the nation, and does not perpetrate injustices against us<sup>-asws</sup>, and does not establish enmity to us<sup>-asws</sup>, and they have doubts in the Caliphate, and do not recognise its deserving ones<sup>-asws</sup>, and its governors, and did not recognise our<sup>-asws</sup> Wilayah, but did not establish enmity against us<sup>-asws</sup>, so those are the weak Muslims, there is hope for the Mercy of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for them, and there is fear for their sins (whether they will be Forgiven or not)’.</p>
<p>قال أبان: قال سليم بن قيس: فلم يبق يومئذ من شيعة علي عليه السلام أحد إلا تهلل وجهه وفرح بمقالته، إذ شرح أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام الأمر وباح به وكشف الغطاء وترك التقية. ولم يبق أحد من القراء ممن كان يشك في الماضين ويكف عنهم ويدع البراءة منهم ورعا وتأثما إلا استيقن واستبصر وحسن رأيه وترك الشك يومئذ والوقوف. ولم يبق حوله ممن أبى بيعته إلا على وجه ما بويع عليه عثمان والماضون قبله إلا رئي ذلك في وجهه وضاق به أمره وكره مقالته. ثم إنه استبصر عامتهم وذهب شكهم.</p>
<p>Aban said that Sulaym said, ‘On that day, there did not remain anyone from the Shiites of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> except that he had joy on his face and was happy with his<sup>-asws</sup> words when Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> explained the matters, and revealed it and uncovered the mask, and left the ‘Taqqiya’ (dissimulation). And there did not remain anyone from the reciters (of the Quran) who had doubts with regards the people of the past, and had paused from then and stayed away from them thinking it to be a sin except that they now had conviction in their perceptions and corrected their opinions, and on that day they left their doubts and their hesitation.</p>
<p>And there did not remain anyone from those who had refused to pay allegiance to him<sup>-asws</sup> although they had paid allegiance to Usman and those before him, but you could see the disgust on their faces due to their abhorrence of his<sup>-asws</sup> words. Then, gradually their eyes were opened, and their doubts disappeared.</p>
<p>قال أبان عن سليم: فما شهدت يوما قط على رؤوس العامة كان أقر لأعيننا من ذلك اليوم، لما كشف أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام للناس من الغطاء وأظهر فيه من الحق وشرح فيه من الأمر والعاقبة وألقى فيه من التقية، وكثرت الشيعة بعد ذلك المجلس من ذلك اليوم وتكلموا، وقد كانوا أقل أهل عسكره وسائر الناس يقاتلون معه على غير علم بمكانه من الله ورسوله، وصارت الشيعة بعد ذلك المجلس أجل الناس وأعظمهم. شهادة أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام وذلك بعد وقعة أهل النهروان وهو يأمر بالتهيئة والمسير إلى معاوية. ثم لم يلبث أن قتل صلوات الله عليه، قتله ابن ملجم لعنه الله غيلة وفتكا، وقد كان سيفه مسموما قد سمه قبل ذلك. وصلى الله على سيدنا أمير المؤمنين وسلم تسليما.</p>
<p>Aban said that Sulaym said, ‘I had never witnessed a day which was more pleasing to our eyes, on the chiefs of the people, than that day, when Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> uncovered from the people, the cover and exposed the truth and explained in it the matters and the outcome of having left the ‘Taqqiya’ (dissimulation). After that, the Shiites became more numerous in their gatherings from that day onwards and used to speak freely, and they used to be very few in his<sup>-asws</sup> army and among the rest of the people, who would object him<sup>-asws</sup> due to lack of their knowledge about his<sup>-asws</sup> position from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>After that, the Shiites became to be more respectable and of elevated status. Then, it was not long before he<sup>-asws</sup> was assissinated. Ibn Muljim, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Curse him, martyed him<sup>-asws</sup> in cold blood with a deadly strike of his poisoned sword which he had applied posion to beforehand. And Peace of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> be upon Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, and Greetings’.</p>

<p>عن أبان، قال سليم: كتب أبو المختار بن أبي الصعق إلى عمر بن الخطاب هذه الأبيات: ألا أبلغ أمير المؤمنين رسالة * فأنت أمين الله في المال والأمر وأنت أمين الله فينا ومن يكن * أمينا لرب الناس يسلم له صدري فلا تدعن أهل الرساتيق والقرى * يخونون مال الله في الأدم الحمر وأرسل إلى النعمان وابن معقل * وأرسل إلى حزم وأرسل إلى بشر وأرسل إلى الحجاج واعلم حسابه * وذاك الذي في السوق مولى بني بدر ولا تنسين التابعين كليهما * وصهر بني غزوان في القوم ذا وفر وما عاصم فيها بصفر عيابه * ولا ابن غلاب من رماة بني نصر واستل ذاك المال دون ابن محرز * وقد كان منه في الرساتيق ذا وقر فأرسل إليهم يصدقوك ويخبروا *</p>
<p>Aban said that Sulaym said, ‘Abu Al-Mukhtar Bin Abu Al-Sa’aq wrote these verses to Umar Bin Al-Khataab: – ‘May this letter reach Amir-ul-Momineen (Umar). ‘You are the trustee of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> in the wealth and the affairs, and you are the trustee of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> with regards to us, and the ones to come. For the trustee of the Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> of the people, my chest bows down to him. Do not leave the inhabitants of the towns and the villages who have betrayed the wealth of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> regarding food and the animals, and send a message to Al-No’man and Ibn Ma’aqal. And send a message to Hazam, and a message to Bishr, and a message to Al-Hajaaj and get to know their accounting. And that is also for the one who is in the market, Mawla the son of Badr, and do not forget all of their followers. And Sahr the son of Ghazwaan, who is affluent in the community, nor Aasim whose bag is not empty, nor Ibn Ghalaab the archer of the clan of Nasr, and the wealth which has accumulated with Ibn Mahraz, and he used to be affluent in the town. So, send a message to them to tell you the truth.</p>
<p>أحاديث هذا المال من كان ذا فكر وقاسمهم أهلي فداؤك إنهم * سيرضون إن قاسمتهم منك بالشطر ولا تدعوني للشهادة إنني * أغيب ولكني أرى عجب الدهر أرى الخيل كالجدران والبيض كالدمى * وخطية في عدة النمل والقطر ومن ريطة مطوية في قرابها * ومن طي أبراد مضاعفة صفر إذ التاجر الداري جاء بفأرة * من المسك راحت في مفارقهم تجري ننوب إذا نابوا ونغزو إذا غزوا * فإن لهم مالا وليس لنا وفر</p>
<p>This is the talk about the wealth from the one who is worried about that, and distribute it among my relatives and they will sacrifice themselves for you. They will be pleased to get a share of the distribution from you, but do not call upon me as a witness for I am hidden, but I see strange things of the times. I see horses like hosts (numerous), and the whiteness like my blood, and errors like the number of ants and the drops of rain, and the folded sheets and what is kept near it, and the merchants who have kept double, and the Musk (perfume), the aroma of which flows into the head if you smell, invades others if you let it flow. So the wealth is for them, and it’s provision is not for us’.</p>
<p>فقال ابن غلاب المصري: ألا أبلغ أبا المختار إني أتيته * ولم أك ذا قربى لديه ولا صهر وما كان عندي من تراث ورثته * ولا صدقات من سبي ولا غدر ولكن دراك الركض في كل غارة * وصبري إذا ما الموت كان ورا السمر بسابغة يغشى اللبان فصولها* أكفكفها عني بأبيض ذي وفر حكم عمر بمصادرة نصف أموال عماله</p>
<p>Ibn Ghalaab Al-Misry said, ‘May it reach Abu Al-Mukhtar that I approached him, and I was not a relative of his nor through in-laws, and there was no inheritance in my posession, nor any charity from the captives nor any treachery, but I participated in every raid. And my patience in the death when it was behind the spears, and the shields which were covering the chests to stop the spears from reaching it. I held back and will be happy with the Judgement of Umar if he were to confiscate half the wealth of his workers’.</p>
<p>قال سليم: فأغرم عمر بن الخطاب تلك السنة جميع عماله أنصاف أموالهم لشعر أبي المختار ولم يغرم قنفذ العدوي شيئا – وقد كان من عماله – ورد عليه ما أخذ منه وهو عشرون ألف درهم ولم يأخذ منه عشره ولا نصف عشره وكان من عماله الذين أغرموا أبو هريرة – وكان على البحرين – فأحصى ماله فبلغ أربعة وعشرون ألفا، فأغرمه اثني عشر ألفا.</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘Umar Bin Al-Khataab, during that year fined all of his workers half of their wealth due to the verses of Abu Al-Mukhtar, but he did not fine Qunfuz Al-Adawyy anything – and he was from his workers – and returned to him what was taken from him, and it was twenty thousand Dirhams, and neither took from him a tenth nor half of the tenth. But, one of his workers who he penalised was Abu Hureira – and he was upon (governor of) Bahrain. So he examined his wealth and it had reached forty thousand, so he fined him twenty thousand.</p>
<p><strong><u>علة العفو عن قنفذ من مصادرة أمواله</u></strong></p>
<p>قال أبان: قال سليم: فلقيت عليا عليه السلام فسألته عما صنع عمر، فقال: هل تدري لم كف عن قنفذ ولم يغرمه شيئا؟ قلت: لا. قال: لأنه هو الذي ضرب فاطمة عليها السلام بالسوط حين جائت لتحول بيني وبينهم، فماتت صلوات الله عليها وإن أثر السوط لفي عضدها مثل الدملج.</p>

He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Do you know why he held back from Qunfuz and did not fine him anything?’ I said, ‘No’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Because he is the one who struck Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> with the whip when she<sup>-asws</sup> came in between myself<sup>-asws</sup> and them.

<p>Al-Abbas said to Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘What is your<sup>-asws</sup> opinion on Umar not penalising Qunfuz like he had penalised the rest of the workers?’ So Ali<sup>-asws</sup> looked at the ones around him<sup>-asws</sup>, then his<sup>-asws</sup> eyes filled up with tears, then he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘In appreciation for the strike which he struck at Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, with the whip. She<sup>-asws</sup> passed away, and on her<sup>-asws</sup> shoulder was the effect of it, like a bruise and swelling’.</p>
<p>ثم قال عليه السلام: العجب مما أشربت قلوب هذه الأمة من حب هذا الرجل وصاحبه من قبله، والتسليم له في كل شيئ أحدثه لئن كان عماله خونة وكان هذا المال في أيديهم خيانة ما كان حل له تركه، وكان له أن يأخذه كله فإنه فيئ المسلمين، فما له يأخذ نصفه ويترك نصفه؟ ولئن كانوا غير خونة فما حل له أن يأخذ أموالهم ولا شيئا منهم قليلا ولا كثيرا، وإنما أخذ أنصافها. ولو كانت في أيديهم خيانة ثم لم يقروا بها ولم تقم عليهم البينة ما حل له أن يأخذ منهم قليلا ولا كثيرا وأعجب من ذلك إعادته إياهم إلى أعمالهم لئن كانوا خونة ما حل له أن يستعملهم، ولئن كانوا غير خونة ما حلت له أموالهم.</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘The strange thing is what the hearts of this community are drinking from the love of this man and his companion that was before him, and their submission to him in everything ‘new’ that he comes up with. If his (2<sup>nd</sup> Caliph’s) workers were fraudsters and that this wealth, which was in their hands was fraudulent, it was not permissible for him to leave it (any of it with them), and he should have taken all of it back, for it was the wealth of the Muslims.</p>
<p>So what made him take half of it and leave the other half (in their possession)? And if it was not fraudulent, then it was not permissible for him to take anything from their wealth, neither little nor a lot. But he (Umar) took half of it. And if that which was in their hands, was fraudulent, and they did not accept it as such, and he did not establish any proof over them for it, it was not permissible for him to take from them, neither little nor a lot. And what is even stranger than that is that he has reinstated some of them back to their positions. If they were fraudsters, it was not permissible for him to keep them as the office-bearers, and if they were not fraudsters, their wealth was not permissible for him (to take back from them)’.</p>

<p>And with regards to him changing the <em>Sa’a</em> of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and his<sup>-saww</sup> <em>Mudd</em>, and in both of them is an obligation and a Sunnah. So, he did not increase anything except for evil, because the poor – with regards to their expiations of the oath and the ‘<em>Zihaar</em>’ – by both of these they give what is obligatory for them. And the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has said: ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Bless for us with regards for our <em>Mudd</em> and our <em>Sa’a</em>!’ They did not place any obstructions between him and that, but they were pleased with it and accepted what he did.</p>
<p><strong><u>غصب فدك </u></strong></p>
<p>وقبضه وصاحبه فدك وهي في يد فاطمة عليها السلام مقبوضة قد أكلت غلتها على عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وآله. فسألها البينة على ما في يدها ولم يصدقها ولا صدق أم أيمن. وهو يعلم يقينا – كما نعلم – أنها في يدها. ولم يكن يحل له أن يسألها البينة على ما في يدها ولا أن يتهمها.</p>
<h2 id="usurpation-of-fadak" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc335645029"></a><a name="_Toc341095467"></a>Usurpation of Fadak</h2>
<p>He (Umar), along with his companion (Abu Bakr), captured Fadak, and it was in the hand (control) of Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>. She<sup>-asws</sup> had consumed from its yield in the era of the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>. So they asked her<sup>-asws</sup> for proof for that which was already in her<sup>-asws</sup> hands, and neither did they ratify her<sup>-asws</sup> nor Umm Ayman<sup>-ra</sup> (Bibi Fizza). And he knew with conviction – just as we<sup>-asws</sup> know – that it was in her<sup>-asws</sup> hands. And it was not permissible for him to ask her<sup>-asws</sup> for proof for that which was already in her<sup>-asws</sup> hands, or for him to hurl accusations at her<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>ثم استحسن الناس ذلك وحمدوه وقالوا: (إنما حمله على ذلك الورع والفضل) ثم حسن قبح فعلهما أن عدلا عنها فقالا: (نظن إن فاطمة لن تقول إلا حقا وإن عليا لم يشهد إلا بحق، ولو كانت مع أم أيمن امرأة أخرى أمضيناها لها). فحظيا بذلك عند الجهال وما هما ومن أمر هما أن يكونا حاكمين فيعطيان أو يمنعان؟ ولكن الأمة ابتلوا بهما فأدخلا أنفسهما فيما لا حق لهما فيه ولا علم لهما به.</p>
<p>Then the people beautified that and praised him for it and said, ‘But he did that due to his piety and virtue’. Then they beautified the ugly deeds of them both as being fair and equitable. So they said, ‘We think that Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> did not say except for the truth, and that Ali<sup>-asws</sup> did not testify except with the truth, and had there been with Umm Ayman another woman (to testify), we would have given it to her<sup>-asws</sup>’. So they both gained credibility by that among the ignorant people, and what are these two, and who made these two to be rulers, so they should be followed or prevented?’ But, the community got involved with the two of them and entered themselves into that in which they had no right for them both, and both of them did not have any knowledge about it.</p>
<p>وقد قالت فاطمة عليها السلام لهما – حين أراد انتزاعها وهي في يدها -: (أليست في يدي وفيها وكيلي وقد أكلت غلتها ورسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حي)؟ قالا: بلى. قالت: (فلم تسألني البينة على ما في يدي)؟ قالا: لأنها فيئ المسلمين، فإن قامت بينة وإلا لم نمضها قالت لهما – والناس حولهما يسمعون -: (أفتريدان أن تردا ما صنع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وتحكما فينا خاصة بما لم تحكما في سائر المسلمين؟ أيها الناس، اسمعوا ما ركباها. أرأيتما إن ادعيت ما في أيدي المسلمين من أموالهم، أتسألونني البينة أم تسألونهم)؟ قالا: بل نسألك.</p>
<p>And Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> had said to them both – when he wanted to take it (Fadak) away from her<sup>-asws</sup>, and it was in her<sup>-asws</sup> hands: ‘Is this not in my<sup>-asws</sup> hands and my<sup>-asws</sup> representative regarding it is here, and I<sup>-asws</sup> had consumed the yield from it whilst the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was alive?’ He said, ‘Yes’. She<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘So why do you ask me<sup>-asws</sup> for the proof on that which is already in my<sup>-asws</sup> hands?’ He said, ‘Because this is war booty for the Muslims, so you<sup>-asws</sup> produce the proof otherwise we will not give it’. She<sup>-asws</sup> said to both of them – and the people around them were listening: ‘Do the two of you want to turn back what the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has done, and you both are issuing a ruling with regards to us<sup>-asws</sup> especially what you two have not issued regarding the rest of the Muslims? O you people! Listen to what they are riding on. Do you think that if I<sup>-asws</sup> were to claim to be in my<sup>-asws</sup> hands from the wealth of the Muslims, you will ask me<sup>-asws</sup> for the proof or from them?’ They said, ‘But we will ask you<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p>قالت: (فإن ادعى جميع المسلمين ما في يدي تسألونهم البينة أم تسألونني)؟ فغضب عمر وقال: إن هذا فيئ للمسلمين وأرضهم، وهي في يدي فاطمة تأكل غلتها، فإن أقامت بينة على ما ادعت أن رسول الله وهبها لها من بين المسلمين – وهي فيئهم وحقهم – نظرنا في ذلك</p>
<p>She<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘If all the Muslims were to make a claim for that which is in my<sup>-asws</sup> hands, you will ask them for the proof or from me<sup>-asws</sup>?’ Umar got angry and said: ‘This is the ‘Fey’ (war booty) for the Muslims and their land, and it is in the hands of Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> and she<sup>-asws</sup> is consuming the yield of it, so if she<sup>-asws</sup> can establish proof on what she<sup>-asws</sup> is claiming that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> gifted it to her<sup>-asws</sup> from between the Muslims – and it is their war booty and their right – we will look into that’.</p>
<p>فقالت: حسبي أنشدكم بالله أيها الناس، أما سمعتم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (إن ابنتي سيدة نساء أهل الجنة)؟ قالوا: اللهم نعم، قد سمعناه من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. قالت: أفسيدة نساء أهل الجنة تدعي الباطل وتأخذ ما ليس لها؟ أرأيتم لو أن أربعة شهدوا علي بفاحشة أو رجلان بسرقة أكنتم مصدقين علي؟ فأما أبو بكر فسكت، وأما عمر فقال: نعم، ونوقع عليك الحد</p>
<p>So she<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘It is sufficient for me<sup>-asws</sup> that I<sup>-asws</sup> should adjure you with Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as Witness, O you people, but have you not heard the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say: ‘My<sup>-saww</sup> daughter<sup>-asws</sup> is the Chieftess of the women of the Paradise?’ They said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes, we have heard it from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. Would the Chieftess of the women of the Paradise make a false claim and take what is not for her to take? Do you think that if four witnesses testify against me<sup>-asws</sup> for immorality, or two men for theft, you will ratify them against me<sup>-asws</sup>?’ As for Abu Bakr, he was silent, but not Umar. He said, ‘Yes, we will apply the Limits (of the Law) on you<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p>فقالت: كذبت ولؤمت، إلا أن تقر أنك لست على دين محمد صلى الله عليه وآله. إن الذي يجيز على سيدة نساء أهل الجنة شهادة أو يقيم عليها حدا لملعون كافر بما أنزل الله على محمد صلى الله عليه وآله، لأن من (أذهب الله عنهم الرجس وطهرهم تطهيرا) لا تجوز عليهم شهادة لأنهم معصومون من كل سوء مطهرون من كل فاحشة.</p>
<p>She said: ‘You lied, and are wicked. Nay, you have accepted that you are not on the Religion of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>. The one who places a requirement of a witness upon the Chieftess of the women of the Paradise, or establish the Limits (of the Law) against her<sup>-asws</sup>, is an accursed infidel by what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent down upon Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>, because they<sup>-asws</sup> are the ones from whom<sup>-asws</sup> Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has kept away all uncleanness and Purified them<sup>-asws</sup> with a thorough Purifying <strong><em>[33:33]</em></strong>. <u>It is not permissible to have witnesses against them<sup>-asws</sup> because they<sup>-asws</sup> are infallible from every evil, and pure from every immorality</u>.</p>
<p>حدثني – يا عمر – من أهل هذه الآية، لو أن قوما شهدوا عليهم أو على أحد منهم بشرك أو كفر أو فاحشة كان المسلمون يتبرؤون منهم ويحدونهم؟ قال: نعم، وما هم وسائر الناس في ذلك إلا سواء</p>
<p>Narrate to me<sup>-asws</sup> – O Umar – who are the People<sup>-asws</sup> (Ahl) of this Verse? If the people testify against them<sup>-asws</sup> or any one<sup>-asws</sup> from them<sup>-asws</sup>, of Polytheism or infidelity, or immorality, will the Muslims keep away from them<sup>-asws</sup> and apply the Limits (of the Law) on them<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He said, ‘Yes, and they<sup>-asws</sup> and the rest of the people with regards to that are not but equal’.</p>
<p>قالت: كذبت وكفرت، ما هم وسائر الناس في ذلك سواء لأن الله عصمهم ونزل عصمتهم وتطهيرهم وأذهب عنهم الرجس. فمن صدق عليهم فإنما يكذب الله ورسوله. فقال أبو بكر: أقسمت عليك – يا عمر – لما سكت</p>
<p>She<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘You have lied and transgressed (Kufr), they<sup>-asws</sup> and the rest of the people are not equal with regards to that because Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Made them<sup>-asws</sup> to be Infallible and Revealed their<sup>-asws</sup> Infallibility, and their<sup>-asws</sup> Purification, and Kept away from them<sup>-asws</sup>, the impurities. Therefore the one who ratifies against them<sup>-asws</sup>, he has lied against Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and his<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>’. Abu Bakr said, ‘I am holding you on oath – O Umar – to keep quiet’.</p>
<p><strong><u>مؤامرة قتل أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام</u></strong></p>
<p>فلما أن كان الليل أرسلا إلى خالد بن الوليد فقالا: إنا نريد أن نسر إليك أمرا ونحملكه لثقتنا بك. فقال: احملاني على ما شئتما، فإني طوع أيديكما. فقالا له: (إنه لا ينفعنا ما نحن فيه من الملك والسلطان ما دام علي حيا أما سمعت ما قال لنا وما استقبلنا به؟ ونحن لا نأمنه أن يدعو في السر فيستجيب له قوم فيناهضنا فإنه أشجع العرب، وقد ارتكبنا منه ما رأيت وغلبناه على ملك ابن عمه ولا حق لنا فيه، وانتزعنا فدك من امرأته. فإذا صليت بالناس صلاة الغداة فقم إلى جنبه وليكن سيفك معك، فإذا صليت وسلمت فاضرب عنقه)</p>

<p>When it was night time, they both (Abu Bakr and Umar) went to Khalid Bin Waleed. They said, ‘We want to issue a secret command to you, and trust that you will be steadfast with it’. He said, ‘Burden me with whatsoever you like, for I am obedient at your hands’. They said to him, ‘This (Caliphate) is of no benefit to us, what we have regarding it, from the kingdom and the Sultanate, so long as Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is still alive. Did you hear what he<sup>-asws</sup> said to us and what he<sup>-asws</sup> had replied back out to us? And we do not feel secure for he<sup>-asws</sup> might call in secret, so the people would respond to him<sup>-asws</sup> and he<sup>-asws</sup> will confront us since he<sup>-asws</sup> is the bravest of the Arabs. And we have committed from it what you have seen, and have overcome the kingdom of the son<sup>-as</sup> of his<sup>-saww</sup> uncle<sup>-as</sup> whilst we had no rights with regards to it, and we confiscated Fadak from his<sup>-asws</sup> wife<sup>-asws</sup>. So when you Pray the morning Prayer with the people, stand beside him<sup>-asws</sup> and have your sword with you, and when I send the salutations in the Prayer, strike his<sup>-asws</sup> neck’.</p>
<p>قال علي عليه السلام: فصلى خالد بن الوليد بجنبي متقلدا السيف. فقام أبو بكر في الصلاة وجعل يؤامر نفسه وندم وأسقط في يده حتى كادت الشمس أن تطلع ثم قال – قبل أن يسلم -: (لا تفعل ما أمرتك) ثم سلم فقلت لخالد: وما ذاك؟ قال: كان قد أمرني – إذا سلم – أن أضرب عنقك قلت: أو كنت فاعلا؟ قال: إي وربي إذا لفعلت</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Khalid Prayed by my<sup>-asws</sup> side wearing the sword. Abu Bakr stood up during the Prayer, and regretted to himself, and was silent with his hands until the sun almost rose. Then he said (to Khalid) – before he sent salutation: ‘Do not do what I had ordered you to’. Then he sent salutations. I<sup>-asws</sup> said to Khalid: ‘And what was that about?’ He said, ‘He had ordered me – when he sends salutations – that I should strike your<sup>-asws</sup> neck’. I<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Would you have done it?’ He said, ‘Yes, and by my Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, I would have done it’.</p>
<p><strong><u>حبس الخمس</u></strong></p>

<p>Sulaym said, ‘Then he<sup>-asws</sup> turned towards Al-Abbas and those who were around him, then said: ‘Do you not wonder at the one who withheld it and his companion who withheld it from us, the share for the near relatives which Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Obligated for us<sup>-asws</sup> in the Quran?

<p>And it is strange that he demolished the house of my<sup>-asws</sup> brother Ja’far and joined it with the Masjid, and never gave his sons anything from its value, neither little nor more.

<p><strong><u>&nbsp;البدعة في غسل الجنابة </u></strong></p>

They claimed that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> passed away never having made any decision with regards to the (inheritance of) grandfather, and no one knows what is to be the inheritance from the grandfather.

<p>And stranger than that is when Abu Kanaf Al-Abady came up to him and said, ‘I divorced my wife whilst I was away, and the news of the divorce reached her. Then I reverted back to her whilst she was still in her waiting period, and I wrote to her. The letter did not reach her until after she had remarried’. He (Umar) wrote to him, ‘If this man who has married her did establish marital relations with her then she is his wife, and if had not had marital relations with her then she is your wife’. And he wrote that to him, and I<sup>-asws</sup> am a witness to it. He never consulted me<sup>-asws</sup> and did not even ask me<sup>-asws</sup> about it. He thought that due to his knowledge, he was in no need of me<sup>-asws</sup>. I<sup>-asws</sup> intended to prevent him, but then I<sup>-asws</sup> thought: ‘What do I<sup>-asws</sup> care if Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Exposes him’. Then the people did not fault him, but beautified his actions and took to his ways and accepted it from him and saw it as being correct, and that is such a judgement that even if an insane person were to judge it, he would not have exceeded this.</p>

<p>Then even stranger than that is that he knew, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> also Knew, and the people knew as well that he was the one who was repelled by the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, when (Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>) asked for the paper (and ink)<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>. Then it did not matter to them, nor did they find any fault with him.</p>
<p>وإنه صاحب صفية حين قال لها ما قال. فغضب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حتى قال ما قال.</p>
<p>And it was him who said to Safiya what he said. So the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was angry to the extent that he<sup>-saww</sup> said what he<sup>-saww</sup> said.</p>

<p>And the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> ordered Abu Bakr to call out within the people, ‘The one who meets Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as a Monotheist, not having associated anything by it, will enter the Paradise’. Umar sent him back, and Abu Bakr obeyed him and disobeyed the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and so he did not carry out his<sup>-saww</sup> order. So the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said regarding that what he<sup>-saww</sup> said.</p>
<p>فمساويه ومساوي صاحبه أكثر من أن تحصى أو تعد، ثم لم ينقصهم ذلك عند الجهال والعامة، وهما أحب إليهم من آبائهم وأمهاتهم وأنفسهم، ويبغضون لهما ما لا يبغضون لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p>So, his evil actions and the evil actions of his companion are more numerous than what you can realise or count. Then they (the people) did not fault them due to their ignorance and the blindness, and these two are more beloved to them than their own fathers and their own mothers and their own selves. They get angry for these two (in their defence), and they do not get angry for the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p><strong><u>إهانة عمر لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله </u></strong></p>

<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘One day I<sup>-asws</sup> passed by Al-Sahhaky (Umar, who was the son of Sahaak), so he said to me<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘What is the example of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> except for the example of a date tree growing in the rubbish dump’. I<sup>-asws</sup> came up to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, so I<sup>-asws</sup> mentioned that to him<sup>-saww</sup>. The Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> got grieved by it and came out distressed to the Pulpit, and the ‘al-Ansar’ (Helpers) were horrified by it and came out armed with their weapons when they saw the disapproval of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>فقال: ما بال أقوام يعيرونني بقرابتي؟ وقد سمعوا مني ما قلت في فضلهم وتفضيل الله إياهم وما اختصهم الله به من إذهاب الرجس عنهم وتطهير الله إياهم، وقد سمعتم ما قلت في أفضل أهل بيتي وخيرهم مما خصه الله به وأكرمه وفضله من سبقه في الإسلام وبلاؤه فيه وقرابته مني وأنه بمنزلة هارون من موسى، ثم تزعمون أن مثلي في أهل بيتي كمثل نخلة نبتت في كناسة؟</p>
<p>He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘What is the problem with the people that they taunt me<sup>-saww</sup> by my<sup>-asws</sup> near relatives?

And you have heard what I<sup>-saww</sup> have said regarding the preferences of the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household, and their goodness which Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Specialised him<sup>-asws</sup> with, and Honoured him<sup>-asws</sup>, and his<sup>-asws</sup> merits of being foremost in Islam, and the afflictions that he<sup>-asws</sup> had to bear with regards to it, and his<sup>-asws</sup> nearness to me<sup>-saww</sup>, and that he<sup>-asws</sup> is unto me<sup>-saww</sup> at the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>-as</sup>, then you are alleging that my<sup>-saww</sup> example among the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household is like the example of a date tree growing in a rubbish dump?</p>
<p>ألا إن الله خلق خلقه ففرقهم فرقتين، فجعلني في خير الفريقين. ثم فرق الفرقة ثلاث فرق، شعوبا وقبائل وبيوتا وجعلني في خيرها شعبا وخيرها قبيلة. ثم جعلهم بيوتا فجعلني في خيرها بيتا، فذلك قوله: (إنما يريد الله ليذهب عنكم الرجس أهل البيت ويطهركم تطهيرا)، فحصلت في أهل بيتي وعترتي وأنا وأخي علي بن أبي طالب.</p>
<p>Nay! Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Created His<sup>-azwj</sup> creation and divided it into two sections. He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made me<sup>-saww</sup> to be in the better of the two sects. Then He<sup>-azwj</sup> Separated the sect into three sections – nations, and tribes, and households, and Made me<sup>-saww</sup> to be in the best of the nations, and the best of the tribes. Then He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made them to be households, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made me<sup>-saww</sup> to be in the best of the Households, so that is His<sup>-azwj</sup> Statement <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[33:33] Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House! and to purify you a (thorough) purifying.”</em></strong> So He<sup>-azwj</sup> Revealed this with regards to the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Family, and myself<sup>-saww</sup> and my<sup>-saww</sup> brother Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>ألا وإن الله نظر إلى أهل الأرض نظرة فاختارني منهم، ثم نظر نظرة فاختار أخي عليا ووزيري ووصيي وخليفتي في أمتي وولي كل مؤمن بعدي. فبعثني رسولا ونبيا ودليلا، فأوحى إلي أن أتخذ عليا أخا ووليا ووصيا وخليفة في أمتي بعدي. ألا وإنه ولي كل مؤمن بعدي، من والاه والاه الله ومن عاداه عاداه الله ومن أحبه أحبه الله ومن أبغضه أبغضه الله. لا يحبه إلا مؤمن ولا يبغضه إلا كافر.</p>
<p>Nay! And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Looked towards the inhabitants of the earth with a Glance (Considered it with a Consideration). So He<sup>-azwj</sup> Chose me<sup>-saww</sup> from among them. Then He<sup>-azwj</sup> Looked (Considered) again, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Chose my<sup>-saww</sup> brother Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, as my<sup>-saww</sup> Vizier, and my<sup>-saww</sup> successor, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Caliph in my<sup>-saww</sup> community, and the guardian of every believer after me<sup>-saww</sup>. He<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent me<sup>-saww</sup> as a Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>, and as a Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and as evidence. So He<sup>-azwj</sup> Revealed unto me<sup>-saww</sup> that I<sup>-saww</sup> should take my<sup>-saww</sup> brother Ali<sup>-asws</sup> to be a guardian, and a Caliph for my<sup>-saww</sup> community after me<sup>-saww</sup>. Nay!</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> is the guardian of every believer after me<sup>-saww</sup>. The one who befriends him<sup>-asws</sup>, Allah<sup>-saww</sup> will Befriend him, and the one who is inimical to him<sup>-asws</sup>, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will be Inimical to him, the one who loves him<sup>-asws</sup>, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Love him, and the one who angers him<sup>-asws</sup>, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will be Angry with him. None will love him<sup>-asws</sup> except for a believer, and none will hate him except for an infidel.</p>
<p>رب الأرض بعدي وسكنها وهو كلمة الله التقوى وعروة الله الوثقى. أتريدون أن تطفؤوا نور الله بأفواهكم؟ والله متم نوره ولو كره المشركون. ويريد أعداء الله أن يطفؤوا نور أخي، ويأبى الله إلا أن يتم نوره. يا أيها الناس، ليبلغ مقالتي شاهدكم غائبكم. اللهم اشهد عليهم.</p>
<p><strong><u>He<sup>-asws</sup> is the ‘Raab ul Arz’ (Lord of the earth and its inhabitants), after me<sup>-saww</sup></u></strong>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> is the pious Word of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the strong Rope of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.&nbsp; Do you want to extinguish the ‘Noor Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>’ (The Light of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>) with your mouths? And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Complete His<sup>-azwj</sup> Light even though the Polytheists may not like it. <strong><em>[9:32]</em></strong>. The enemies of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> want to extinguish the Noor of my<sup>-saww</sup> brother, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Refused that, except that He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Ensure the Completion of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Noor. O you people! Those who are witnesses to this should make my<sup>-saww</sup> words reach to those who are absent from among you. Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, be a Witness to them!</p>
<p>يا أيها الناس، إن الله نظر نظرة ثالثة فاختار منهم بعدي اثني عشر وصيا من أهل بيتي وهم خيار أمتي منهم أحد عشر إماما بعد أخي واحدا بعد واحد كلما هلك واحد قام واحد منهم. مثلهم كمثل النجوم في السماء كلما غاب نجم طلع نجم لأنهم أئمة هداة مهتدون، لا يضرهم كيد من كادهم ولا خذلان من خذلهم بل يضر الله بذلك من كادهم وخذلهم.</p>
<p>O you people! Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Looked (Considered) for a third time, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Chose from among them, after me<sup>-saww</sup>, Twelve Successors from the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household, and they<sup>-asws</sup> are the best of my<sup>-saww</sup> community. Among them<sup>-asws</sup> are Eleven Imams<sup>-asws</sup> after my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, one after the other. Whenever one of them<sup>-asws</sup> passes away, another one<sup>-asws</sup> will take his<sup>-asws</sup> place from them<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>Their<sup>-asws</sup> example is like the example of the stars in the sky. Whenever a star disappears, another one rises, because they<sup>-asws</sup> are the Guiding Imams<sup>-asws</sup> who are Guided (by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>). The plots of the plotters do not adversely affect them<sup>-asws</sup>, nor does the abandonment of the ones who abandon them<sup>-asws</sup>, but Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Ensure that the ones who plotted, and the ones who abandoned will be the ones to be adversely affected by that.</p>
<p>فهم حجة الله في أرضه وشهداءه على خلقه. من أطاعهم أطاع الله ومن عصاهم عصى الله. هم مع القرآن والقرآن معهم، لا يفارقونه ولا يفارقهم حتى يردوا على حوضي.</p>
<p>So, they<sup>-asws</sup> are the ‘Hujjat Allah’ (Proofs of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>) in His<sup>-azwj</sup> earth, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Witnesses over His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures. The one who obeys them<sup>-asws</sup> has obeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who disobeys them<sup>-asws</sup> has disobeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. They<sup>-asws</sup> are with the Quran and the Quran is with them<sup>-asws</sup>. Neither will they<sup>-asws</sup> separate from it, nor will it separate from them<sup>-asws</sup> until they<sup>-asws</sup> return to me<sup>-saww</sup> at the (Divine) Fountain (in the Hereafter).</p>
<p>أول الأئمة أخي علي خيرهم، ثم ابني الحسن ثم ابني الحسين ثم تسعة من ولد الحسين، وأمهم ابنتي فاطمة، صلوات الله عليهم. ثم من بعدهم جعفر بن أبي طالب ابن عمي وأخو أخي، وعمي حمزة بن عبد المطلب.</p>
<p>The first of the Imams<sup>-asws</sup> is my<sup>-saww</sup> brother Ali<sup>-asws</sup> who is the best of them<sup>-asws</sup>. Then, my<sup>-saww</sup> son Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, and my<sup>-saww</sup> son Al-Husayn. Then, nine from the sons<sup>-asws</sup> of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, and their<sup>-asw</sup> mother is my<sup>-saww</sup> daughter Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, may Peace be upon them<sup>-asws</sup>. Then, after them<sup>-asws</sup>, the best is Ja’far Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> the son of my<sup>-saww</sup> uncle<sup>-asws</sup> and the brother of my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, and my<sup>-saww</sup> uncle Hamza Bin Abd Al-Muttalib<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>ألا إني محمد بن عبد الله. أنا خير المرسلين والنبيين، وفاطمة ابنتي سيدة نساء أهل الجنة، وعلي وبنوه الأوصياء خير الوصيين، وأهل بيتي خير أهل بيوتات النبيين وابناي سيدا شباب أهل الجنة.</p>
<p>Nay! I<sup>-saww</sup> am Muhammad Bin Abd Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. I<sup>-saww</sup> am the best of the Messengers<sup>-as</sup> and the Prophets<sup>-as</sup>, and Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> my<sup>-saww</sup> daughter is the Chieftess of the women of the Paradise, and Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and his<sup>-asws</sup> successor sons<sup>-asws</sup> are the best of the successors<sup>-as</sup>, and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household are the best of the people of the households of the Prophets<sup>-as</sup>, and my<sup>-saww</sup> two sons<sup>-asws</sup> are the Chiefs of the youths of the Paradise.</p>
<p>أيها الناس، إن شفاعتي ليرجوها رجاءكم، أفيعجز عنها أهل بيتي؟ ما من أحد ولده جدي عبد المطلب يلقى الله موحدا لا يشرك به شيئا إلا أدخله الجنة ولو كان فيه من الذنوب عدد الحصى وزبد البحر.</p>
<p>O you people! As for my<sup>-saww</sup> intercession, it is what you hope for, and it is your desire. Do you reckon that the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household will be deprived of it? There is none from the children of my<sup>-saww</sup> grandfather Abd Al-Muttalib<sup>-as</sup> who will meet Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as a ‘Mushrik’ (Monotheist), not having associated the slightest of anything by it, but he will enter the Paradise, even though his sins may equAl-the number of the pebbles, and the foam of the sea.</p>
<p>أيها الناس، عظموا أهل بيتي في حياتي ومن بعدي وأكرموهم وفضلوهم، فإنه لا يحل لأحد أن يقوم من مجلسه لأحد إلا لأهل بيتي. إني لو أخذت بحلقة باب الجنة ثم تجلى لي ربي تبارك وتعالى فسجدت وأذن لي بالشفاعة، لم أوثر على أهل بيتي أحدا.</p>
<p>O you people! Magnify the Members<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household in my<sup>-saww</sup> lifetime and after me<sup>-saww</sup>, and honour them<sup>-asws</sup> and prefer them<sup>-asws</sup>, for it is not permissible for anyone to stand up from his place for anyone else except for the people<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household. If I<sup>-saww</sup> were to grab hold of the Door of the Paradise, then my<sup>-saww</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> Blessed and High is Manifested for me<sup>-saww</sup>, so I<sup>-saww</sup> will prostrate and He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Permit me<sup>-saww</sup> for the intercession, I<sup>-saww</sup> will not give priority to anyone over the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household.</p>
<p>أيها الناس، انسبوني من أنا؟ فقام إليه رجل من الأنصار فقال: نعوذ بالله من غضب الله ومن غضب رسوله، أخبرنا – يا رسول الله – من الذي آذاك في أهل بيتك حتى نضرب عنقه وليبر عترته. فقال: انسبوني، أنا محمد بن عبد الله بن عبد المطلب بن هاشم حتى انتسب إلى نزار، ثم مضى في نسبه إلى إسماعيل بن إبراهيم خليل الله، ثم قال: إني وأهل بيتي بطينة طيبة من تحت العرش إلى آدم نكاح غير سفاح لم يخالطنا نكاح الجاهلية.</p>
<p>O you people! Look at my<sup>-saww</sup> lineage. Who am I<sup>-saww</sup>?’ So a man from the Helpers stood up and said, ‘We seek refuge with Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> from the Wrath of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and from the wrath of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>. Inform us, O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, who is the one who has hurt you<sup>-asws</sup> with regards to the People<sup>-asws</sup> of your<sup>-saww</sup> Household, so that we may strike his neck-off and his family becomes ineffective’.</p>
<p>So he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> will introduce my<sup>-saww</sup> lineage. I<sup>-saww</sup> am Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> Bin Abd Allah<sup>-asws</sup> bin Abd Al-Muttalib<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Hashim<sup>-asws</sup>’ – until he<sup>-saww</sup> mentioned the lineage up to Nazaar, then continued in his lineage up to Ismail<sup>-as</sup> bin Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup>, the Friend (Khaleel) of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, then said – ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household are by the good clay from underneath the Throne, up to Adam<sup>-as</sup>, our (lineage) is through (holy) matrimony and not through adultery (as some of you). Do not include us<sup>-asws</sup> in (those who were born as a result of) the marriages of the ignorance.</p>

So he Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup> and said, ‘Had you<sup>-saww</sup> related me to someone else, I would have been pleased with it and would have accepted it’.</p>
<p>Then another man stood up to him<sup>-saww</sup> and said to him<sup>-saww</sup>, ‘Who is my father?’ So he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Your father is so and so’ – someone other than whom he had been claiming him to be – so he reverted back from Islam (became an apostate). Then another man stood up to him<sup>-saww</sup> and said, ‘Am I from the inhabitants of the Paradise or from the inhabitants of the Fire?’ So he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘From the inhabitants of the Paradise’. Then another man stood up and said, ‘Am I from the inhabitants of the Paradise or from the inhabitants of the Fire?’ So he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘From the inhabitants of the Fire’.</p>

<p>And he is the one who came along with the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, hurting me in the group of his companions, when he winked at his companion, so he stood up and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, you<sup>-saww</sup> have made an oath to us about Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and I cannot see who it will be if he<sup>-asws</sup> were to perish in this?’ So the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Sit down’. He<sup>-saww</sup> called this out three times. The Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> addressed them both saying: ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, he<sup>-asws</sup> will not pass away in this illness of his<sup>-asws</sup>. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, he<sup>-asws</sup> will not pass away until you two fill him<sup>-asws</sup> with rage, and heap upon him<sup>-asws</sup> treacheries and injustices, then you will find him to be patient and consistent. And he<sup>-asws</sup> will not pass away until he<sup>-asws</sup> receives from you both errors upon errors, and he<sup>-asws</sup> will not pass away except as a martyr, an assassinated one’.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 3 * إتمام الحجة على أبي بكر وعمر وعثمان في خلافة علي عليه السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>وأعظم من ذلك كله أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله جمع ثمانين رجلا، أربعين من العرب وأربعين من العجم – وهما فيهم – فسلموا علي بإمرة المؤمنين. ثم قال: (إني أشهدكم أن عليا أخي ووزيري ووارثي وخليفتي في أمتي ووصيي في أهلي وولي كل مؤمن بعدي، فاسمعوا له وأطيعوا)، وفيهم أبو بكر وعمر وعثمان وطلحة والزبير وسعد وعبد الرحمن بن عوف وأبو عبيدة وسالم ومعاذ بن جبل ورهط من الأنصار. ثم قال: (إني أشهد الله عليكم).</p>

<p>And greater than all of that is that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> gathered eighty men, forty from the Arabs and forty from the non-Arabs – and they were both among them – so they greeted me<sup>-asws</sup> as <em>Amir-ul-Momineen</em><sup>-asws</sup>. Then he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> hold you all as witnesses that Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is my<sup>-saww</sup> brother, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Vizier, and my<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, and my<sup>-saww</sup> caliph in my<sup>-saww</sup> community, and my<sup>-saww</sup> successor<sup>-asws</sup> in my<sup>-saww</sup> Family, and my<sup>-saww</sup> guardian on every believer after me<sup>-saww</sup>. So listen to him<sup>-asws</sup> and obey him<sup>-asws</sup>’. And among them were Abu Bakr, and Umar, and Usman, and Talha, and Al-Zubayr, and Sa’d, and Abdul Rahmaan Bin Awf, and Abu Ubeyda, and Saalim, and Ma’az Bin Jabal, and a group from the ‘al-Ansar’ (the Helpers)<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>. Then he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> keep Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as a Witness on you all’.</p>
<p><strong><u>الانتخاب أو الانتصاب أو الشورى </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم أقبل علي عليه السلام على القوم فقال: سبحان الله، مما أشربت قلوب هذه الأمة من بليتهما وفتنتهما، من عجلها وسامريها. إنهم أقروا وادعوا أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لم يستخلف أحدا وأنه أمر بالشورى وقال من قال: (إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لم يستخلف أحدا وإن نبي الله قال: (إن الله لم يكن ليجمع لنا أهل البيت بين النبوة والخلافة)، وقد قال لأولئك الثمانين رجلا: (سلموا على علي عليه السلام بإمرة المؤمنين) وأشهدهم على ما أشهدهم عليه.</p>
<h2 id="the-election-or-the-selection-or-the-consultation" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc335645049"></a><a name="_Toc341095487"></a>The election, or the selection, or the consultation</h2>
<p>Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> turned towards the people and said: ‘Glory be to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>! What the hearts of the people have drunk from the afflictions and the discords of these two, from the calf and the Samiri of the people. They all accepted, and then claimed that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> never left behind anyone (as Caliph), and he ordered for the consultation, and so said the one who said that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> never left behind anyone (as Caliph) and that the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> said that: ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> never Gathers together for us<sup>-asws</sup> the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, the Prophet-hood and the Caliphate’. And he<sup>-saww</sup> said to eighty of those people: ‘Greet Ali<sup>-asws</sup> as ‘Amir-ul-Momineen’, and made them witnesses over it, along with others who also witnessed it.</p>
<p>والعجب أنهم أقروا ثم ادعوا أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لم يستخلف أحدا وأنهم أمروا بالشورى، ثم أقروا أنهم لم يشاوروا في أبي بكر وأن بيعته كانت فلتة. وأي ذنب أعظم من الفلتة.</p>
<p>And it is strange that they accepted, and then claimed that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> never left behind anyone (as Caliph), and so they ordered for the consultation. Then they accepted that they themselves never had a consultation with regards to Abu Bakr (becoming caliph), and that the allegiance to him happened as a slip. And which sin is greater than the slip.</p>
<p>ثم استخلف أبو بكر عمر ولم يقتد برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فيدعهم بغير استخلاف فقيل له في ذلك، فقال: (أدع أمة محمد كالنعل الخلق، أدعهم بغير أحد أستخلف عليهم)؟ طعنا منه على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ورغبة عن رأيه</p>
<p>Then Abu Bakr made Umar to be the Caliph, while not adhering to the way of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> that he had alleged not to have left behind a Caliph. When people reminded him of that. He (Abu Bakr) said, ‘Shall I leave the community of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> like a broken slipper, leaving them without anyone as Caliph over them?’ This was his taunt on the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and he was away from his<sup>-saww</sup> opinion.</p>
<p>ثم صنع عمر شيئا ثالثا. لم يدعهم على ما ادعى أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لم يستخلف ولا استخلف كما استخلف أبو بكر، وجاء بشيء ثالث وجعلها شورى بين ستة نفر وأخرج منها جميع العرب. ثم حظى بذلك عند العامة، فجعلهم مع ما أشربت قلوبهم من الفتنة والضلالة أقراني ثم بايع ابن عوف عثمان فبايعوه، وقد سمعوا من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في عثمان ما قد سمعوا من لعنه إياه في غير موطن.</p>
<p>Then Umar came up a third thing (for the selection of a caliph). He did not leave them on what he had claimed that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> never left behind a Caliph, nor did he appoint a Caliph as Abu Bakr had appointed, and came up with a third scenario. He made it a consultation between six people and excluded from it all the Arabs. Then he gained the support for that among the general public. He made them to be with those whose hearts drank from the afflictions and the errors. Ibn Awf accepted me<sup>-asws</sup>, then paid allegiance to Usman, so they all paid allegiance to him, and they had heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> with regards to Usman what they had heard from him<sup>-saww</sup> having cursed him in other places.</p>
<p><strong><u>أبو بكر وعمر أسوء حالا من عثمان </u></strong></p>
<p>فعثمان على ما كان عليه خير منهما. ولقد قال منذ أيام قولا رققت له وأعجبتني مقالته. بينما أنا قاعد عنده في بيته إذ أتته عائشة وحفصة تطلبان ميراثهما من ضياع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وأمواله التي بيده، فقال: (لا والله ولا كرامة لكما ولا نعمت عنه ولكن أجيز شهادتكما على أنفسكما. فإنكما شهدتما عند أبويكما أنكما سمعتما من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (النبي لا يورث، ما ترك فهو صدقة). ثم لقنتما أعرابيا جلفا يبول على عقبيه ويتطهر ببوله (مالك بن أوس بن الحدثان) فشهد معكما، ولم يكن في أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله من المهاجرين ولا من الأنصار أحد شهد بذلك غيركما وغير أعرابي.</p>
<h2 id="abu-bakr-and-umar-were-worse-than-usman" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc335645050"></a><a name="_Toc341095488"></a>Abu Bakr and Umar were worse than Usman</h2>
<p>As for Usman, he was better than the two of them. He said some words, days ago, that I<sup>-asws</sup> sympathised with and his speech pleased me<sup>-asws</sup>. I<sup>-asws</sup> was seated in his presence at his house when Aisha and Hafsa came over seeking their inheritance from the loss of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and their wealth which was in his hands. He said, ‘No, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, there is no honour for the two of you, nor any enjoyment from it, but I have been permitted by the very testimonies that you two bore against yourselves. The two of you bore testified to your own two fathers that you two had heard the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying: ‘The Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> does not bequeath, whatsoever that he<sup>-saww</sup> leaves behind is charity’. Then the two of you teamed-up an uncouth Bedouin who was urinating like an animal and cleaning himself with his own urine (Malik Bin Aws Bin Al-Hadsaan), so he testified with the two of you. And there was none among the companions of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> neither from the Emigrants nor from the Helpers who testified to that apart from the two of you and that Bedouin.</p>
<p>أما والله، ما أشك أنه قد كذب على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وكذبتما عليه معه. ولكني أجيز شهادتكما على أنفسكما فاذهبا فلا حق لكما. فانصرفتا من عنده تلعنانه وتشتمانه. فقال: ارجعا، أليس قد شهدتما بذلك عند أبي بكر؟ قالتا: نعم. قال: فإن شهدتما بحق فلا حق لكما، وإن كنتما شهدتما بباطل فعليكما وعلى من أجاز شهادتكما على أهل هذا البيت لعنة الله والملائكة والناس أجمعين.</p>
<p>But, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, there is no doubt that he lied against the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and the two of you lied with him. But for me, I am permitted by the very testimonies of the two of you against your own selves, so go away, for there is no right for the two of you. So, the two of them left from his presence cursing and insulting him.</p>
<p>So he said, ‘Come back, did not the two of you testify that in the presence of Abu Bakr?’ They said, ‘Yes’. He said, ‘So if the two of you have testified by the truth, there is no right now for the two of you, and if the two of you have testified falsely, then upon the two of you, and the one who permitted your testimonies, are the Curses of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Angels, and all of the people’.</p>
<p>قال عليه السلام: ثم نظر إلي فتبسم ثم قال: يا أبا الحسن، أشفيتك منهما؟ قلت: نعم، والله وأبلغت وقلت حقا، فلا يرغم الله إلا آنافهما. فرققت لعثمان وعلمت أنه إنما أراد بذلك رضاي وأنه أقرب منهما رحما وأكف عنا منهما، ح وإن كان لا عذر له ولا حجة بتأميره علينا وادعائه حقنا.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Then he (Usman) looked at me<sup>-asws</sup>, smiled, then said, ‘O Abu Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, was I just with two of them?’ I said, ‘Yes, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, you have conveyed and spoken the truth. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will not but humiliate the two of them’. I<sup>-asws</sup> sympathised with Usman, and I<sup>-asws</sup> knew that he only intended to please me<sup>-asws</sup> by that, and he was similar to the two of them (Abu Bakr and Umar) in unjust, and held back from us<sup>-asws</sup> (our rights) more than the two of them, and it was not an excuse for him, nor an argument that he could construct against us<sup>-asws</sup> and his claim over our<sup>-asws</sup> rights’.</p>

<p>By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, we have seen with the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, our fathers got killed, and our sons, and our brothers, and our paternal uncles and our maternal uncles, and the people of our households, then that did not increase us except for our faith, and our submission, and our efforts in obedience to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the enthusiasm in fighting against the enemies. When the man from us and the man from our enemies fought in a duel, both of them were sincerely determined to get the other one to drink from the cup of death. So sometimes it was for us from our enemies, and at times it was for our enemies from us. When Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Saw us as sincere and patient, He<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent down the Book with good Praises for us, and was Pleased with us, and Sent down Help upon us.</p>
<p><strong><u>فرار أبي بكر وعمر في الحروب وسوء أدبهما عند الصلح </u></strong></p>
<p>ولست أقول: إن كل من كان مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كذلك، ولكن أعظمهم وجلهم وعامتهم كانوا كذلك. ولقد كانت معنا بطانة لا تألونا خبالا. قال الله عز وجل: (قد بدت البغضاء من أفواههم وما تخفي صدورهم أكبر.</p>

<p>And I<sup>-asws</sup> am not saying that all those that were with the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> were like that, but a great number of them, and most of them, and the generality of them were like that. And there was with us group of friends whose help did not get to us. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Said <strong><em>“[3:118] vehement hatred has already appeared from out of their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater still”</em></strong>.</p>
<p>ولقد كان منهم بعض من تفضله أنت وأصحابك – يا ابن قيس – فارين، فلا رمى بسهم ولا ضرب بسيف ولا طعن برمح. إذا كان الموت والنزال لاذ وتوارى واعتل، ولاذ كما تلوذ النعجة العوراء لا تدفع يد لامس، وإذا لقي العدو فر ومنح العدو دبره جبنا ولؤما، وإذا كان عند الرخاء والغنيمة تكلم، كما قال الله: سلقوكم بألسنة حداد أشحة على الخير).</p>
<p>And among them were some whom you and your companion give preference to – O Ibn Qays – deserters who neither shot an arrow, nor struck with a sword, not stabbed with a spear. When there was death and the battle, they resorted to hiding and pretending to be sick, and they fled like the fleeing of the sheep not letting anyone lay a hand upon them. And when they met the enemy, they fled and showed cowardice and wickedness. And when it was during the prosperity and the booty (from the war) they spoke, as Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Said <strong><em>“[33:19] but when the fear is past, they will smite you with sharp tongues, covetous of the goods”</em>.</strong></p>
<p>فلا يزال قد استأذن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في ضرب عنق الرجل الذي ليس يريد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قتله، فأبى عليه. ولقد نظر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يوما وعليه السلاح تام، فضحك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ثم قال – يكنيه -: (أبا فلان، اليوم يومك) فقال الأشعث: ما أعلمني بمن تعني إن ذلك يفر منه الشيطان قال عليه السلام: يا بن قيس، لا آمن الله روعة الشيطان إذ قال</p>
<p>So he (Umar) never ceased to seek permission from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> to strike the neck of the men whom the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> did not want to kill, so he<sup>-saww</sup> would refuse (him). And one day the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saw him with the weapon (put on him without being in the state of war), so the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> smiled, then said: ‘O father of so and so, today is your day’.</p>
<p>Al-Ash’as said, ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> have not made it known to me as to who is meant by that, from whom even the Satan<sup>-la</sup> would flee’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Ibn Qays, there is no safety with Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> from the sight of the Satan<sup>-la</sup> when he said it’.</p>
<p><strong><u>إخبار أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام عن عاقبة أمر أصحابه </u></strong></p>

<p>Nay! The strangeness of all strange things is the ignorance of this community, and its straying, and its leaders driving it to the Fire, because they have heard the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying, promising at the beginning: ‘No community will hand over any of its commands to any man when there is a more knowledgeable one among them, except that it will not cease going lower in its affairs, until they return to what they had avoided’. So they gave the command to a group of three before me<sup>-asws</sup>, and there was no man among them who had collected the Quran nor made a claim to know the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, nor the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>. And they had firm conviction that I<sup>-asws</sup> was more knowledgeable than them of the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and more contemplative than them, and better read than them of the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and a better judge than them of the Judgements of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>وأنه ليس رجل من الثلاثة له سابقة مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ولا عناء معه في جميع مشاهده، فلا رمى بسهم ولا طعن برمح ولا ضرب بسيف جبنا ولؤما ورغبة في البقاء. وقد علموا أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قاتل بنفسه فقتل أبي بن خلف وقتل مسجع بن عوف. وكان من أشجع الناس وأشدهم لقاء وأحقهم بذلك.</p>
<p>And there was no man from the three of them who had offered any help to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, nor shared any of his<sup>-saww</sup> problems in all that which had been witnessed. <strong><u>Neither did they shoot an arrow, nor stabbed with a spear, nor struck with a sword. They were cowards, and fearful and desired to remain alive</u>.</strong> And they knew that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> fought himself<sup>-saww</sup> personally, so he<sup>-saww</sup> killed Ubay Bin Khalaf and killed Masja’a Bin Awf who was one of the bravest of the people and severest in duels, and was the most deserving of that (to be killed).</p>
<p>وقد علموا يقينا أنه لم يكن فيهم أحد يقوم مقامي، ولا يبارز الأبطال ولا يفتح الحصون غيري، ولا نزلت برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله شديدة قط ولا كربة أمر ولا ضيق ومستصعب من الأمر إلا قال: (أين أخي علي، أين سيفي، أين رمحي، أين المفرج غمي عن وجهي)، فيقدمني، فأتقدم فأفديه بنفسي ويكشف الله بيدي الكرب عن وجهه. ولله عز وجل ولرسوله بذلك المن والطول حيث خصني بذلك ووفقني له.</p>
<p>And they convincingly knew that there was no one from among them who could stand in my<sup>-asws</sup> place, or strive against the falsehood, or conquer the forts apart from myself, and there did not come down upon the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> any severity whatsoever, nor any unfavourable situation, nor any narrowness and difficulty from the affairs except that he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Where is my<sup>-saww</sup> brother Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, where is my<sup>-saww</sup> sword, where is my<sup>-saww</sup> spear, where is the one who<sup>-asws</sup> takes away my<sup>-saww</sup> grief from my<sup>-saww</sup> face?’</p>
<p>So he<sup>-saww</sup> would place me<sup>-asws</sup> forward, and I<sup>-asws</sup> would go forth sacrificing myself<sup>-asws</sup> for him<sup>-saww</sup>, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Removed the grief from his<sup>-saww</sup> face by my<sup>-asws</sup> hand.

<p>وهو القائل يوم الخندق لأصحابه الأربعة – أصحاب الكتاب والرأي -: (والله إن ندفع محمدا إليهم برمته نسلم من ذلك، حين جاء العدو من فوقنا ومن تحتنا) كما قال الله تعالى: (وزلزلوا زلزالا شديدا)، (وظنوا بالله الظنونا)، (وقال المنافقون والذين في قلوبهم مرض ما وعدنا الله ورسوله إلا غرورا).</p>

<p>And he was the one who told his four companions – his writers and his advisors, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if we hand over Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> to them outright, we will be safe from that’, and this was when we had enemies from the top of us and from underneath us, as Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Said <strong><em>“[33:11] and they were shaken with a severe shaking”, “[33:10] and you began to think diverse thoughts of Allah”, “[33:12] And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease began to say: Allah and His Messenger did not promise us (victory) but only to deceive”</em></strong>.</p>
<p>فقال له صاحبه: (لا، ولكن نتخذ صنما عظيما نعبده لأنا لا نأمن أن يظفر ابن أبي كبشة فيكون هلاكنا ولكن يكون هذا الصنم لنا ذخرا فإن ظفرت قريش أظهرنا عبادة هذا الصنم وأعلمناهم أنا لن نفارق ديننا، وإن رجعت دولة ابن أبي كبشة كنا مقيمين على عباد ة هذا الصنم سرا).</p>
<p>So his companion (Abu Bakr) said to him (Umar), ‘No, but we will take a great idol and worship it, because we do not feel secure if Ibn Abu Kabasha is victorious, so he will destroy us, but if we have this idol with us it will be an asset for us. So if the Qureish are victorious over us, we will show them that we have been worshipping this idol, and we will let them know that we had never separated from our religion. And if the government of Ibn Abu Kabasha returns, then we will remain on the worship of this idol in secret’.</p>
<p>فنزل جبرئيل عليه السلام فأخبر النبي صلى الله عليه وآله بذلك، ثم خبر به رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بعد قتلي ابن عبد ود. فدعاهما فقال: (كم صنم عبدتما في الجاهلية)؟ فقالا: يا محمد، لا تعيرنا بما مضى في الجاهلية. فقال صلى الله عليه وآله لهما: (فكم صنم تعبدان يومكما هذا)؟ فقالا: والذي بعثك بالحق نبيا ما نعبد إلا الله منذ أظهرنا من دينك ما أظهرنا.</p>
<p>So Jibraeel, may Peace be upon him, descended and informed the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of that, then the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> informed about it after I<sup>-asws</sup> had killed Ibn Abd Wad. So he<sup>-saww</sup> called both of them over. He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘How many idols did you two worship during the era of ignorance?’ They said, ‘O Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>, do not embarrass us of what has passed in the era of ignorance’. He<sup>-saww</sup> said to both of them: ‘So how many idols did you two worship on this day of yours?’ They said, ‘By the One Who<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent you<sup>-saww</sup> with the truth as a Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, we have not worshipped any except Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> since appeared to us from your<sup>-saww</sup> Religion what appeared to us’.</p>
<p>فقال: يا علي، خذ هذا السيف، فانطلق إلى موضع كذا وكذا فاستخرج الصنم الذي يعبدانه فاهشمه. فإن حال بينك وبينه أحد فاضرب عنقه. فانكبا على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فقالا: استرنا سترك الله. فقلت أنا لهما: (اضمنا لله ولرسوله أن لا تعبدا إلا الله ولا تشركا به شيئا). فعاهدا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله على ذلك. وانطلقت حتى استخرجت الصنم من موضعه وكسرت وجهه ويديه وجذمت رجليه، ثم انصرفت إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فوالله لقد عرفت ذلك في وجههما علي حتى ماتا</p>
<p>He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, take this sword and go to such and such a place, take out the idol which they have been worshipping and smash it. And if anyone comes between you<sup>-asws</sup> and it, strike his neck’. They both fell down in front of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and said, ‘Veil us, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Veil you<sup>-saww</sup>’. So I<sup>-asws</sup> said to both of them: ‘Do you two give the guarantee to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and to His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup> that you will not worship any except for Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and will not associate anything with Him<sup>-azwj</sup>?’ They made an oath to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> for that. And I<sup>-asws</sup> went until I<sup>-asws</sup> took out the idol from its place and cut off its head, and its hand, and made pieces of its legs, then I<sup>-asws</sup> went to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.&nbsp; By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> saw that (embarrassment) in both of their faces to the day they died.</p>
<p><strong><u>مخاصمة أبي بكر وعمر للأنصار بحجة علي عليه السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم انطلق هو وأصحابه – حين قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله – فخاصموا الأنصار بحقي. فإن كانوا صدقوا واحتجوا بحق (أنهم أولى من الأنصار لأنهم من قريش ورسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله من قريش)، فمن كان أولى برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كان أولى بالأمر، وإنما ظلموني حقي، وإن كانوا احتجوا بباطل فقد ظلموا الأنصار حقهم، والله يحكم بيننا وبين من ظلمنا حقنا وحمل الناس على رقابنا.</p>

<p>Then he and his companions went – when the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away – so they quarrelled with the Helpers by my<sup>-asws</sup> right. So if they were speaking the truth, and arguing by my<sup>-asws</sup> right that, ‘they were higher than the Helpers because they were from the Qureish and that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was from the Qureish’, so the one who was higher due to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was higher (to have) the command. But rather, they wronged me<sup>-asws</sup> by my<sup>-asws</sup> right. And if they were arguing wrongly, so they had wronged the Helpers of their right, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Judge between us<sup>-asws</sup> and the one who wronged us of our<sup>-asws</sup> rights, and burdened us<sup>-asws</sup> by placing the people upon our<sup>-asws</sup> necks.</p>
<p><strong><u>ابتلاء الأمة بحب مضليها وقصورها عن لعنهم </u></strong></p>
<p>والعجب لما قد أشربت قلوب هذه الأمة من حبهم وحب من صدهم عن سبيل ربهم وردهم عن دينهم والله، لو أن هذه الأمة قامت على أرجلها على التراب ووضعت الرماد على رؤوسها وتضرعت إلى الله ودعت إلى يوم القيامة على من أضلهم وصدهم عن سبيل الله ودعاهم إلى النار وعرضهم لسخط ربهم وأوجب عليهم عذابه – بما أجرموا إليهم – لكانوا مقصرين في ذلك.</p>

<p>And the strange thing is what the hearts of this community have drunk from its love for them and the love for the ones who repulsed them from the Way of their Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, and turned them back from their Religion. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, even if this community stands upon its feet on the dust, and puts ashes upon its heads and laments to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and supplicates up to the Day of Judgement against the ones who misled them from the Way of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and called them to the Fire, they will still be exposed to the Wrath of their Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Punishment would be more than Obligated upon them – for the crimes that were committed – they would still fall short with regards to that.</p>
<p><strong><u>ما منع أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام عن إعلان الحقائق </u></strong></p>
<p>وذلك أن المحق الصادق والعالم بالله ورسوله يتخوف إن غير شيئا من بدعهم وسننهم وأحداثهم، وعادته العامة، ومتى فعل شاقوه وخالفوه وتبرؤا منه وخذلوه وتفرقوا عن حقه، وإن أخذ ببدعهم وأقر بها وزينها ودان بها أحبته وشرفته وفضلته.</p>

<p>And this is due to the fact that the righteous<sup>-asws</sup>, the sincere<sup>-asws</sup> and the knowledgeable one<sup>-asws</sup> and the inheritor of the Knowledge of Allah and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>, is fearful to alter anything from their innovations, and their ways and their traditions and their general habits. And when he<sup>-asws</sup> does that, they will doubt him<sup>-asws</sup>, and oppose him<sup>-asws</sup> and keep away from him<sup>-asws</sup> and abandon him<sup>-asws</sup> and separate from his<sup>-asws</sup> rights. And if he<sup>-asws</sup> were to take to their innovations, they will accept him<sup>-asws</sup> and adorn him<sup>-asws</sup>, and if he<sup>-asws</sup> makes this to be the Religion, they will love him<sup>-asws</sup>, and honour him<sup>-asws</sup> and prefer him<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>والله لو ناديت في عسكري هذا بالحق الذي أنزل الله على نبيه وأظهرته ودعوت إليه وشرحته وفسرته – على ما سمعت من نبي الله صلى الله عليه وآله فيه – ما بقي فيه إلا أقله وأذله وأرذله ولاستوحشوا منه ولتفرقوا عني.</p>
<p>By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if I<sup>-asws</sup> were to make this call, within my<sup>-asws</sup> army, of the truth which Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Sent down upon His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> and displayed it and called towards Him<sup>-azwj</sup> and explained it and interpreted it – on all that what I<sup>-asws</sup> heard from the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> with regards to it – there will not remain any but a few of them, and they will humiliate it as a trivial matter and disperse from me<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>ولولا ما عاهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إلي وسمعته منه وتقدم إلي فيه لفعلت، ولكن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قد قال: (يا أخي، كل ما اضطر إليه العبد فقد أحله الله له وأباحه إياه)، وسمعته يقول: (إن التقية من دين الله، ولا دين لمن لا تقية له).</p>
<p>And had not the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> given an oath to me<sup>-asws</sup>, and I<sup>-asws</sup> heard it from him<sup>-saww</sup> before, I<sup>-asws</sup> would have done so (announced the facts). But, the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had said: ‘O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, all that which is forced upon the servant, so Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Permitted it for him and neutralised it for him’. And I<sup>-asws</sup> have heard him<sup>-saww</sup> say that: ‘The ‘Taqeeya’ (dissimulation) is from the religion of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who does not observe Taqeeya has no religion’.</p>
<p>ثم أقبل عليه السلام علي فقال: أدفعهم بالراح دفعا عني * ثلثان من حي وثلث مني فإن عوضني ربي فأعذرني</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> turned towards me and said (a poem): ‘They pushed the claim away from me<sup>-asws</sup>, two thirds from the district and a third from me<sup>-asws</sup>, for my<sup>-asws</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> will Compensate me<sup>-asws</sup> and Excuse me<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p><strong><u>ابتلاء أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام بأخابث الناس </u></strong></p>
<p>وقال علي عليه السلام للحكمين – حين بعثهما -: (أحكما بكتاب الله وسنة نبيه وإن كان فيهما حز حلقي، فإنه من قادها إلى هؤلاء فإن نيتهم أخبثت). فقال له رجل من الأنصار: ما هذا الانتشار الذي بلغني عنك؟ ما كان أحد من الأمة أضبط للأمر منك، فما هذا الاختلاف والانتشار؟ فقال علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام: أنا صاحبك الذي تعرف، إلا أني قد بليت بأخابث من خلق الله، أريدهم على الأمر فيأبون، فإن تابعتهم على ما يريدون تفرقوا عني</p>

<p>A man from the Helpers said to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘What is this being circulated which had reached to me related to you<sup>-asws</sup>? There is no one from the community who is more appropriate for the command than you<sup>-asws</sup> are. So why is this opposition, and the disorder?’</p>

<p>Aban from Sulaym, who said, ‘We came back from Siffeen along with Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>. The army camped near to a Christian Monastery. A very old man, of beautiful face, good built and good looks came out from the Monastery, and he had a book in his hand. He came over to Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>. He greeted him<sup>-asws</sup> as ‘Caliph’. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said to him: ‘Welcome, O my<sup>-asws</sup> brother Shamoon Bin Hamoon. May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on you, how are you?’</p>
<p>He said, ‘I am well, O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, and O the Chief of the Muslims, and O the Successor of the Messenger<sup>-saww</sup> of the Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> of the Worlds. I am from the lineage of men from the disciples of your<sup>-asws</sup> brother Isa Bin Maryam may Peace be upon him<sup>-as</sup>, and I am from the lineage of Shamoon Bin Yohanna<sup>-as</sup>, the successor of Isa Bin Maryam<sup>-as</sup>.

His<sup>-saww</sup> name will be Ahmad<sup>-saww</sup>. He<sup>-saww</sup> will have two wide eyes with connected eyebrows. He<sup>-saww</sup> will be the owner of the camel, and the donkey, and the staff, and the crown – meaning the turban. He<sup>-saww</sup> will have twelve names for him<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>

<p>Then, in it is the mention of the declaration of his<sup>-saww</sup> Prophet-hood, and his<sup>-saww</sup> coming (to earth), and his<sup>-saww</sup> migration, and the ones who will fight against him<sup>-saww</sup>, and the ones who will help him<sup>-saww</sup>, and the ones who will be inimical to him<sup>-saww</sup>, and for how long he<sup>-saww</sup> will live, and what the community will undergo after him<sup>-saww</sup> regarding the sects and the differences.

<p>In the Name of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Ahmad<sup>-saww</sup> is the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and his<sup>-saww</sup> name is Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>, and Yaseen, and Taha, and Noon, and Al-Fateh, and Al-Khatam, and Al-Haashar, and Al-Aaqab, and Al-Maahy, and he<sup>-saww</sup> is the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the Friend of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the Beloved of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Qualities, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Trustee, and His<sup>-azwj</sup>, the best one. He<sup>-saww</sup> will have been transferred within the worshippers – meaning in the foreheads of the Prophets<sup>-as</sup> – and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Speak to him<sup>-saww</sup> by His<sup>-azwj</sup> Mercy. So He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Mention, when He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Mention. And he<sup>-saww</sup> is the most prestigious to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> of the Creatures of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the most Beloved of them to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. Never has Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Created a creature – neither an Angel of Proximity nor a Messenger Prophet<sup>-as</sup>, from Adam<sup>-as</sup> and others – better than him<sup>-saww</sup> and more Beloved to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> than him<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Make him<sup>-saww</sup> to sit upon His<sup>-azwj</sup> Throne, and He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Accept the intercession of every one that he<sup>-saww</sup> intercedes for. And it is by his<sup>-saww</sup> name that the Pen flows on the Guarded Tablet in the Mother of the Book, and by his<sup>-saww</sup> name, Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>ثم أخوه صاحب اللواء يوم القيامة يوم الحشر الأكبر، وأخوه ووصيه ووزيره، وخليفته في أمته، وأحب خلق الله إلى الله بعده علي بن أبي طالب ولي كل مؤمن بعده. ثم أحد عشر إماما من ولد أول الاثني عشر، اثنان سميا ابني هارون شبر وشبير وتسعة من ولد أصغرهما وهو الحسين، واحدا بعد واحد، آخرهم الذي يصلي عيسى بن مريم خلفه). فيه تسمية كل من يملك منهم ومن يستسر بدينه ومن يظهر. فأول من يظهر منهم يملأ جميع بلاد الله قسطا وعدلا، ويملك ما بين المشرق والمغرب حتى يظهره الله على الأديان كلها.</p>
<p>Then his<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup> will be the owner of the Banner on the Day of Judgement, the Day of the Great Resurrection, Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, his<sup>-saww</sup> brother, and his<sup>-saww</sup> successor<sup>-asws</sup>, and his<sup>-saww</sup> Vizier, and the Caliph in his<sup>-saww</sup> community, and the most Beloved of the creatures of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> after him<sup>-saww</sup> is the Guardian of every believer after him<sup>-saww</sup>. Then eleven Imam<sup>-asws</sup> from the Children of the first of the twelve, two of his<sup>-asws</sup> sons will be named after the sons of Haroon<sup>-as</sup>, Shabbar and Shabbir, and nine from the children of the younger of the two, and he<sup>-asws</sup> is Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, one after the other, the last one<sup>-asws</sup> of them<sup>-asws</sup> being the one<sup>-asws</sup> behind whom<sup>-asws</sup> Isa<sup>-as</sup> Bin Maryam<sup>-as</sup> will Pray.</p>
<p>In it are the names of everyone who will rule from among them<sup>-asws</sup>, and the one<sup>-asws</sup> who will veil his<sup>-asws</sup> Religion and conceal it, and the one<sup>-asws</sup> who will make it to be apparent. So the first one<sup>-asws</sup> from among them who<sup>-asws</sup> will manifest the Religion, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Will Fill up all the countries with equity and justice, and he<sup>-asws</sup> will rule over what is between the East and the West, until Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Manifest it (Islam) over all the religions.</p>
<p>فلما بعث النبي – وأبي حي – صدق به وآمن به وشهد أنه رسول الله، وكان شيخا كبيرا ولم يكن به شخوص. فمات أبي وقال لي: (إن وصي محمد وخليفته – الذي اسمه في هذا الكتاب ونعته – سيمر بك إذا مضى ثلاثة أئمة من أئمة الضلالة والدعاة إلى النار المسمين بأسمائهم وقبائلهم فلان وفلان وفلان ونعتهم وكم يملك كل واحد منهم، فإذا مر بك فاخرج إليه وبايعه وقاتل معه عدوه فإن الجهاد معه كالجهاد مع محمد، والموالي له كالموالي لمحمد والمعادي له كالمعادي لمحمد).</p>
<p>(Shamoon Bin Hamoon said) When the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> declared his<sup>-saww</sup> Prophet-hood – and my father was alive – he ratified it and believed by it and testified that he<sup>-saww</sup> is the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and he was a very old man and he was not able to walk. My father died and said to me, ‘The successor<sup>-asws</sup> of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> and his<sup>-saww</sup> Caliph – whose name is in this Book along with his<sup>-asws</sup> ‘Kuniya’ (teknonym) – will pass by you after the passing away of three Imams from the Imams of misguidance who will call to the Fire who have been named with their names, and their tribes, so and so, and so and so, and so and so, and their ‘Kuniya’ (teknonyms), and how long they will rule for, each one of them. So when he<sup>-asws</sup> passes by you, come out to him<sup>-asws</sup> and pay allegiance to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and fight alongside him<sup>-asws</sup> against his<sup>-asws</sup> enemies, for the struggling (Jihad) with him<sup>-asws</sup> is like struggling (Jihad) with Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>, and befriending him<sup>-asws</sup> is like befriending Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> and being inimical to him<sup>-asws</sup> is like being inimical to Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>

<p>Then he said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, extend your<sup>-asws</sup> hand so I can give allegiance to you, for I testify that there is no god except Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and I testify that Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> is His<sup>-azwj</sup> servant and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>, and I testify that you<sup>‑asws</sup> are the Caliph of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> in his<sup>-saww</sup> community, and are his<sup>-saww</sup> successor<sup>-asws</sup>, and his<sup>-saww</sup> witness over His<sup>-azwj</sup> earth and Proof in His<sup>-azwj</sup> earth, and that Islam is the religion of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and I distance myself from every religion that is different to the Religion of Islam, for it is the Religion that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Chosen Himself<sup>-azwj</sup> and is Pleased with it for His<sup>-azwj</sup> Guardians, and it is the Religion of Isa<sup>-as</sup> Bin Maryam<sup>-as</sup> and the ones before him<sup>-as</sup> from the Prophets<sup>-as</sup> and the Messengers<sup>-as</sup>. And this is what the ones who have passed from my forefathers had made it to be their Religion. And I hereby befriend you<sup>-asws</sup> and your<sup>-asws</sup> friends, and distance myself from your<sup>-asws</sup> enemies and befriend the eleven Imams<sup>-asws</sup> from your<sup>-asws</sup> children, and distance myself from their<sup>-asws</sup> enemies and from the ones who oppose them<sup>-asws</sup>, and distance myself from those who claimed their<sup>-asws</sup> rights, and oppressed them, be they from the former ones or the later ones. Then he took his<sup>-asws</sup> hand and gave allegiance to him<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>ثم قال له أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام: ناولني كتابك، فناوله إياه. فقال علي عليه السلام لرجل من أصحابه: قم مع هذا الرجل فانظر ترجمانا يفهم كلامه، فلينسخه لك بالعربية مفسرا. فأتاه مكتوبا بالعربية. فلما أتاه به قال لابنه الحسن عليه السلام: يا بني، ائتني بالكتاب الذي دفعته إليك. فأتاه به، فقال: أنت يا بني اقرأه، وانظر أنت يا فلان – الذي تستجهل – في نسخة هذا الكتاب، فإنه خطي بيدي وإملاء رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله علي. فقرأه فما خالف حرفا واحدا ليس فيه تقديم ولا تأخير، كأنه إملاء رجل واحد على رجلين</p>
<p>Then Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> said to him: ‘Hand over to me<sup>-asws</sup> your Book’. So he handed it over to him<sup>-asws</sup>. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said to a man from his<sup>-asws</sup> companions: ‘Arise and go with this man and look at the translation, and understand its words, and make a copy of it explaining it in Arabic. So he gave it to him<sup>-asws</sup> in Arabic. When he came with it, he<sup>-asws</sup> said to his<sup>-asws</sup> son Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>: ‘O my<sup>-asws</sup> son, give me<sup>-asws</sup> the Book that I<sup>-asws</sup> had handed it over to you<sup>-asws</sup>’. So he<sup>-asws</sup> came with it.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O my<sup>-asws</sup> son<sup>-asws</sup>, read it out – and look, O so and so which you are ignorant of – in the copy of this Book, for it has been written by my<sup>-asws</sup> hand as dictated to me<sup>-asws</sup> by the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.&nbsp; So he<sup>-asws</sup> read it out and there was no difference of even a single letter, between the first one and the other one, as if they both had been dictated by the same man to two men.</p>
<p>فحمد الله أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام وأثنى عليه وقال: (الحمد لله الذي لو شاء لم تختلف الأمة ولم تفترق، والحمد لله الذي لم ينسني ولم يضع أمري ولم يخمل ذكري عنده وعند أوليائه إذ صغر وخمل ذكر أولياء الشيطان وحزبه).</p>
<p>So, Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, and said: ‘Praise be to the One<sup>-azwj</sup> Who, had He<sup>-azwj</sup> Desired as such, there would have been no differences in the community nor would it have been separated (into sects), and Praise be to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Who did not Forget me<sup>-asws</sup> or let my<sup>-asws</sup> affairs go to waste, and did not Hide my<sup>-asws</sup> remembrance with Him<sup>-azwj</sup> or His<sup>-azwj</sup> Friends, even a little, and Hid the remembrance of the friends of the Satan<sup>-la</sup> and his<sup>-la</sup> group.</p>
<p>ففرح بذلك من حضر عند أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام من شيعته وشكر، وساء ذلك كثيرا ممن حوله حتى عرفنا ذلك في وجوههم وألوانهم.</p>
<p>So, those Shiites who were present with Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> were happy with that and were thankful, and that displeased many who were around him<sup>-asws</sup> to the extent that we recognised that in their faces and their colours (expressions).</p>

<p>أبان عن سليم بن قيس قال: صعد أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام المنبر، فحمد الله وأثنى عليه وقال: أيها الناس، أنا الذي فقأت عين الفتنة ولم يكن ليجترئ عليها غيري. وأيم الله لو لم أكن فيكم لما قوتل أهل الجمل ولا أهل صفين ولا أهل النهروان. وأيم الله لولا أن تتكلموا وتدعوا العمل لحدثتكم بما قضى الله على لسان نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله لمن قاتلهم مستبصرا في ضلالتهم عارفا بالهدى الذي نحن عليه.</p>
<p>Aban from Sulaym Bin Qays, who said, ‘Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> ascended the pulpit, so he<sup>-asws</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup> and said: ‘O you people! I<sup>-asws</sup> am the one who gouged out the eye of the ‘Fitna’ (strife) and it was not for anyone apart from me<sup>-asws</sup> to be able to do that. And I<sup>-asws</sup> say by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, had I<sup>-asws</sup> not been among you all, you would not have fought against the people of the Camel (Al-Jamal), nor the people of Siffeen, nor the people of Al-Nahrwaan. And I<sup>-asws</sup> say by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if you had spoken and claimed what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Decreed upon the tongue of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> you would have visualised and recognised the error of those that were killed, and the guidance that we are on.</p>
<p>ثم قال عليه السلام: سلوني عما شئتم قبل أن تفقدوني، فوالله إني بطرق السماء أعلم مني بطرق الأرض. أنا يعسوب المؤمنين وأول السابقين وإمام المتقين وخاتم الوصيين ووارث النبيين وخليفة رب العالمين. أنا ديان الناس يوم القيامة وقسيم الله بين أهل الجنة والنار، وأنا الصديق الأكبر والفاروق الذي أفرق بين الحق والباطل، وإن عندي علم المنايا والبلايا وفصل الخطاب، وما من آية نزلت إلا وقد علمت فيما نزلت وأين نزلت وعلى من نزلت. أيها الناس، إنه وشيك أن تفقدوني، إني مفارقكم وإني ميت أو مقتول. ما ينتظر أشقاها أن يخضبها من فوقها؟ يعني لحيته من دم رأسه.</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Ask me whatsoever that you like before you miss me<sup>-asws</sup>, for by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> I<sup>-asws</sup> am more aware of the pathways of the sky than I<sup>-asws</sup> am of the roads of the earth. I<sup>-asws</sup> am the ‘Yasoob’ (King) of the believers, and the first of the preceding ones, and the Imam<sup>-asws</sup> of the pious, and the seal-(ultimate) of the successors, and the inheritor of the Prophets<sup>-as</sup>, and the Caliph of the Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> of the worlds. I<sup>-asws</sup> am the examiner of the people on the Day of Judgement and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>’s (Appointed) Divider of people between the Paradise and the Fire.</p>
<p>And I<sup>-asws</sup> am the Great Truthful (Al-Siddique Al-Akbar), and the great Differentiator (Al-Farouq) who differentiates between the truth and the falsehood, and with me<sup>-asws</sup> is the knowledge of the deaths, and the afflictions, and the intricacies of the speech. And there is no Verse which has Descended except that I<sup>-asws</sup> know with regards to what was Descended, and where it Descended, and about whom it was Descended. O you people! It is imminent that you will miss me<sup>-asws</sup>. I<sup>-asws</sup> will separate from you all, and I<sup>-asws</sup> will soon leave, being assassinated. What is he waiting for (my killer) to dye it (with my blood) from above it ( from head)?’ Meaning his<sup>-asws</sup> beard from the blood of his<sup>-asws</sup> head.</p>
<p>والذي فلق الحبة وبرأ النسمة، لا تسألوني من فئة تبلغ ثلاثمائة فما فوقها فيما بينكم وبين قيام الساعة إلا أنبأتكم بسائقها وقائدها وناعقها، وبخراب العرصات متى تخرب ومتى تعمر بعد خرابها إلى يوم القيامة.</p>
<p>‘By the One<sup>-azwj</sup> Who Split the seed and Freed the person, you will not ask me about a group which has reached three hundred (in number) nor above it between you all (at present) and the Establishment of the Hour, except that I<sup>-asws</sup> will give you the news of its ushers, and its guides and its callers, and the spoiling of the ground, when it will get spoilt and when it will be revived after it having been taken by force to the Day of Judgement’.</p>
<p>فقام رجل فقال: يا أمير المؤمنين، أخبرنا عن البلايا. فقال عليه السلام: إذا سأل سائل فليعقل وإذا سئل مسئول فليلبث. إن من ورائكم أمورا ملتجة مجلجلة وبلاء مكلحا مبلحا. والذي فلق الحبة وبرأ النسمة، لو قد فقدتموني ونزلت عزائم الأمور وحقائق البلاء لقد أطرق كثير من السائلين واشتغل كثير من المسؤولين. وذلك إذا ظهرت حربكم ونصلت عن ناب وقامت عن ساق وصارت الدنيا بلاء عليكم حتى يفتح الله لبقية الأبرار.</p>
<p>So a man stood up and said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, inform us about the ‘Fitna’ (afflictions)’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘When a questioner asks so he should understand, and when the questioned one is asked, he should reply responsibly. There are matters behind you, which will weaken you and concern you, frightening and difficult afflictions.</p>
<p>By the One<sup>-azwj</sup> Who Split the seed and Freed the person, if you were to lose me<sup>-asws</sup>, and the great matters descend upon you and the reality of the afflictions dawn upon you, many of the questioners will get frustrated and many of them will be humiliated by trying to find solutions (to their problems). And that will happen when you will be forced into wars and it will engulf the entire world, and the world will become a scourge for you all until such time when Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Grant a victory through the ‘لبقية الأبرار’ (Imam e Zaman<sup>ajfj</sup>).</p>
<p>فقام رجل فقال: يا أمير المؤمنين، حدثنا عن الفتن. فقال عليه السلام: إن الفتن إذا أقبلت شبهت وإذا أدبرت أسفرت. وإن الفتن لها موج كموج البحر وإعصار كإعصار الريح، تصيب بلدا وتخطئ الآخر. فانظروا أقواما كانوا أصحاب الرايات يوم بدر فانصروهم تنصروا وتؤجروا وتعذروا.</p>
<p>A man stood up and said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, narrated to us about the ‘Fitna’ (strife).</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘The ‘Fitna’ when it comes, places you in doubt, and when it goes away it becomes obvious (leaves behind its disastrous effects). And the ‘Fitna’ has waves for it like the waves of the sea and gusts like the gusts of the wind (hurricane), affecting one country and leaving another. So look at the people<sup>-asws</sup> who were the standard bearers on the Day of Badr. Help them<sup>-asws</sup> and you will be helped and rewarded and be excused.</p>
<p><strong><u>فتنة بني أمية </u></strong></p>
<p>أخوف الفتن ألا إن أخوف الفتن عليكم من بعدي فتنة بني أمية. إنها فتنة عمياء صماء مطبقة مظلمة، عمت فتنتها وخصت بليتها. أصاب البلاء من أبصر فيها وأخطأ البلاء من عمي عنها. أهل باطلها ظاهرون على أهل حقها، يملؤون الأرض بدعا وظلما وجورا. وأول من يضع جبروتها ويكسر عمودها وينزع أوتادها الله رب العالمين وقاصم الجبارين.</p>

<p>I<sup>-asws</sup> fear the ‘Fitna’. Nay! I<sup>-asws</sup> fear for your all the ‘Fitna’ of the Clan of ‘Umayyad’ (Umayyad) . It will be blind, deaf, and have levels of darkness. Its ‘Fitna’ will be general but its affliction will be specific. It will trouble the one who sees it, and stray the one who would avoid it.</p>
<p>Its wrongful ones will force themselves upon its rightful ones, filling the earth with innovation, injustice and oppression. The first one to End its tyranny and Break its pillars and Remove its pegs will be no one but Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> the Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> of the Worlds, the Crusher of the tyrants.</p>
<p>ألا إنكم ستجدون بني أمية أرباب سوء بعدي كالناب الضروس تعض بفيها وتخبط بيديها وتضرب برجليها وتمنع درها. وأيم الله، لا تزال فتنتهم حتى لا تكون نصرة أحدكم لنفسه إلا كنصرة العبد السوء لسيده، إذا غاب سبه وإذا حضر أطاعه. وأيم الله لو شردوكم تحت كل كوكب لجمعكم الله لشر يوم لهم.</p>
<p>Nay! You will find the Clan of Umayyad to be evil lords after me<sup>-asws</sup>, like the teeth of a canine biting by it, hitting by its hands and striking by its legs and preventing from its pearls. And I<sup>-asws</sup> swear by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, their ‘Fitna’ will not cease until not one of you will be able to help himself but like the help of the bad slave for his master, if he is absent he abuses him, and if he is present, he obeys him. And I<sup>-asws</sup> swear by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, even if you disperse to be underneath each of the stars, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Gather you all for their evil days.</p>
<p><strong><u>فتن ما بعد بني أمية </u></strong></p>
<p>فقال الرجل: فهل من جماعة – يا أمير المؤمنين – بعد ذلك؟ قال عليه السلام: إنها ستكونون جماعة شتى، عطاؤكم وحجكم وأسفاركم واحد والقلوب مختلفة. قال: قال واحد: كيف تختلف القلوب؟ قال عليه السلام: هكذا – وشبك بين أصابعه – ثم قال: يقتل هذا هذا وهذا هذا، هرجا هرجا ويبقى طغام جاهلية ليس فيها منار هدى ولا علم يرى. نحن أهل البيت منها بمنجاة ولسنا فيها بدعاة.</p>

<p>The man said, ‘Will there be a community after that, O Amir-ul-Momineen?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘There will be a diverse community. Your charities and your Pilgrimages and your travels will be one, but your hearts will be different’. One of them said, ‘How will their hearts be different?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Like this’ – and tangled his<sup>-asws</sup> fingers – then said: ‘This one will kill this one, and this one will kill this one. There will be trouble after trouble, and the unfairness of the era of ignorance will remain. There will not be a Minaret of guidance or a flag to be seen. We<sup>-asws</sup>, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household will be rescued from it, and we<sup>-asws</sup> will not be preaching ‘calling’ (that will be the time of Taqeeya) during that time.</p>
<p>قال: فما أصنع في ذلك الزمان يا أمير المؤمنين؟ قال عليه السلام: انظروا أهل بيت نبيكم، فإن لبدوا فالبدوا وإن استنصروكم فانصروهم تنصروا وتعذروا، فإنهم لن يخرجوكم من هدى ولن يدعوكم إلى ردى، ولا تسبقوهم بالتقدم فيصرعكم البلاء وتشمت بكم الأعداء. يفرج الله عن الفتن بالإمام المهدي عليه السلام</p>
<p>One asked, ‘So what shall I do in that era, O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Look at the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household of your Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>. If they<sup>-asws</sup> remain at their<sup>-asws</sup> homes, you remain at your homes, and if they<sup>-asws</sup> ask you for your help, help them so that you will be helped and be excused, for they<sup>-asws</sup> will never exit you from guidance, and will never call you all to destruction, and do not place yourselves in front of them<sup>-asws</sup> or else you will be killed by the afflictions and your enemies will rejoice over you. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Release you from the ‘Fitna’ by the Imam Al-Mahdi<sup>ajfj</sup>’.</p>
<p>قال: فما يكون بعد ذلك يا أمير المؤمنين؟ قال عليه السلام: يفرج الله البلاء برجل من بيتي كانفراج الأديم من بيته. ثم يرفعون إلى من يسومهم خسفا ويسقيهم بكأس مصبرة ولا يعطيهم ولا يقبل منهم إلا السيف، هرجا هرجا، يحمل السيف على عاتقه ثمانية أشهر حتى تود قريش بالدنيا وما فيها أن يروني مقاما واحدا فأعطيهم وآخذ منهم بعض ما قد منعوني وأقبل منهم بعض ما يرد عليهم حتى يقولوا: (ما هذا من قريش، لو كان هذا من قريش ومن ولد فاطمة لرحمنا) يغريه الله ببني أمية فيجعلهم تحت قدميه ويطحنهم طحن الرحى. (ملعونين أينما ثقفوا أخذوا وقتلوا تقتيلا، سنة الله في الذين خلوا من قبل ولن تجد لسنة الله تبديلا).</p>
<p>He said, ‘So what will happen after that, O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Effect the Release from the affliction by a man<sup>-asws</sup> from my<sup>-asws</sup> Household, but many will turn against him<sup>ajfj</sup>.&nbsp; Then He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Raise them to the one<sup>-asws</sup> who will swallow up their afflictions and quench them with a consoling cup, and he<sup>-asws</sup> will neither give them nor will he<sup>-asws</sup> accept from them anything except with the sword.</p>
<p>There will be (at that time) troubles after troubles, he<sup>-asws</sup> will carry the sword for eight months, to the extent that the Qureish would wish to give the whole world and whatever it contains (in order to find relief) to be able to see me<sup>-asws</sup> at least once. So that they can give me back whatever they had taken from me. But he (Imam e Zaman<sup>ajfj</sup>) will be very severe on them (without giving them any allowances) until they will say, ‘This man is not from the Qureish. Had he<sup>-asws</sup> been from the Qureish and from the children of Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, he<sup>-asws</sup> would be merciful to us’.</p>
<p>Thus Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Give him<sup>-asws</sup> victory over the Clan of Umayyad, so he<sup>ajfj</sup> will place them under his<sup>ajfj</sup> feet, and he<sup>-asws</sup> will grind them like the grinding of the mill. <strong><em>[33:61] They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall be seized and slain (without mercy).</em></strong> <strong><em>[33:62] (Such has been) the course of Allah with respect to those who have gone before; and you shall not find any change in the course of Allah.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>أهل البيت عليهم السلام هم الملجأ في الفتن </u></strong></p>
<p>أما بعد، فإنه لا بد من رحى تطحن ضلالة، فإذا طحنت قامت على قطبها. ألا وإن لطحنها روقا وإن روقها حدها وعلى الله فلها. ألا وإني وأبرار عترتي وأطائب أرومتي أحلم الناس صغارا وأعلمهم كبارا. معنا راية الحق والهدى، من سبقها مرق ومن خذلها محق ومن لزمها لحق. إنا أهل بيت من علم الله علمنا، ومن حكم الله الصادق قيلنا، ومن قول الصادق سمعنا. فإن تتبعونا تهتدوا ببصائرنا وإن تتولوا عنا يعذبكم الله بأيدينا أو بما شاء. نحن أفق الإسلام، بنا يلحق المبطئ وإلينا يرجع التائب.</p>

<p>Having said that, it does not have to be a hand mill in order to grind the misguidance, for the mill stands upon its pole. Nay! When it is grinding, it has a limit to it, and upon Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> there is not. Nay! Myself<sup>-asws</sup> and my<sup>-asws</sup> good Family<sup>-asws</sup> and the good ones from my<sup>-asws</sup> relatives are the most forbearing of the people when they are young and the most knowledgeable of them in their adulthood.</p>
<p>With us is the banner of the truth and guidance, the one who wants to over take it will exit Religion due to misguidance, and the one who abandons it will perish (meet destruction), and the one who adheres to it will arrive to the truth.</p>
<p>Us, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, we teach from the Knowledge of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and it is from the Wisdom of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> that we speak truthfully, and it is from the truthful speech that we<sup>-asws</sup> hear. So, if you all were to follow us<sup>-asws</sup>, you will be guided by our<sup>-asws</sup> vision, and if you turn away from us<sup>-asws</sup> you will be Punished by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> by our<sup>-asws</sup> hands or in whatever manner that He<sup>-azwj</sup> so Desires. We are the zenith (source) of Islam. It is by us<sup>-asws</sup> that the one who lags behind can catch up, and the one who repents can return.</p>
<p>والله لولا أن تستعجلوا ويتأخر الحق لنبأتكم بما يكون في شباب العرب والموالي، فلا تسألوا أهل بيت محمد العلم قبل إبانه، ولا تسألوهم المال على العسر فتبخلوهم، فإنه ليس منهم البخل. وكونوا أحلاس البيوت، ولا تكونوا عجلا بذرا. كونوا من أهل الحق تعرفوا به وتتعارفوا عليه، فإن الله خلق الخلق بقدرته وجعل بينهم الفضائل بعلمه وجعل منهم عبادا اختارهم لنفسه ليحتج بهم على خلقه. فجعل علامة من أكرم منهم طاعته وعلامة من أهان منهم معصيته. وجعل ثواب أهل طاعته النضرة في وجهه في دار الأمن والخلد الذي لا يورع أهله، وجعل عقوبة أهل معصيته نارا تأجج لغضبه، (وما ظلمهم الله ولكن كانوا أنفسهم يظلمون).</p>
<p>By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if you do not make haste and truth is not delayed, I<sup>-asws</sup> would give you the news of that which would even be understood by the youths of the Arabs and their friends. However, do not ask the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> about the knowledge before its time, and do not ask them<sup>-asws</sup> for the wealth during hardship, lest you consider them<sup>-asws</sup> to be miserly, for miserliness is not from them<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>And assume (honourable) positions in your dwellings rather becoming like the wandering calves. Be from the people of the truth and to be recognised by it, for Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Created the creatures by His<sup>-azwj</sup> Power and Made preferences to be between them by His<sup>-azwj</sup> Knowledge, and Made servants<sup>-asws</sup> from among them Chosen by Himself<sup>-azwj</sup> in order to establish arguments over His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures by them<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>So He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made them<sup>-asws</sup> to be the ‘Signs’. The one who honours them<sup>-asws</sup> will be in obedience, and the one who disregards them<sup>-asws</sup> will be disobedient. And He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made the Reward for the obedient ones to be blissful in their faces in the House of Safety and the eternity in which they will not separate from their families, and Made the Punishment for the people of disobedience to be the Fire which has been ignited by His<sup>-azwj</sup> Wrath. <strong><em>[16:33] and Allah was not unjust to them, but they were unjust to themselves.</em></strong></p>
<p>يا أيها الناس، إنا أهل بيت بنا ميز الله الكذب، وبنا يفرج الله الزمان الكلب وبنا ينزع الله ربق الذل من أعناقكم وبنا يفتح الله وبنا يختم الله. فاعتبروا بنا وبعدونا وبهدانا وبهداهم وبسيرتنا وسيرتهم وميتتنا وميتتهم، يموتون بالدال والقرح والدبيلة، ونموت بالبطن والقتل والشهادة.</p>
<p>O you people! It is through us<sup>-asws</sup>, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Exposed the lies, and it is by us<sup>-asws</sup> that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Removes the hardships from the dogs (aggressors), and it is by us<sup>-asws</sup> that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Removes the rope of humiliation from your necks, and it is by us<sup>-asws</sup> that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Begins and it is by us<sup>-asws</sup> that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Ends.

<p><strong>* 1 *</strong> – قال سليم بن قيس: سمعت أبا الحسن عليه السلام يحدثني ويقول: إن النبي صلى الله عليه وآله قال: منهومان لا يشبعان: منهوم في الدنيا لا يشبع منها، ومنهوم في العلم لا يشبع منه. فمن اقتصر من الدنيا على ما أحل الله له سلم، ومن تناولها من غير حلها هلك إلا أن يتوب ويراجع. ومن أخذ العلم من أهله وعمل به نجا، ومن أراد به الدنيا هلك وهو حظه.</p>
<p><strong>1 –</strong> Sulaym Bin Qays said, ‘I heard Abu Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> narrate to me and he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘The Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Two hungry ones do not get satisfied – one who is hungry for the world, his hunger will not be satisfied from it, and one who hungers for the knowledge, his hunger will not be satisfied from it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the one who limits himself from the world to what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Permitted for him will be safe, and the one who will take it from other than what has been Permitted for him will perish unless he repents and returns. And the one who takes the knowledge from its rightful people will be saved, <u>and one who intends by it (to benefit from) the world will perish</u><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><u>[27]</u></a>, and it will be his share. (Making religion as an earning vehicle is forbidden).</p>
<p>والعلماء عالمان: عالم عمل بعلمه فهو ناج، وعالم تارك لعلمه فهو هالك. إن أهل النار ليتأذون من نتن ريح العالم التارك لعلمه. وإن أشد أهل النار ندامة وحسرة رجل دعا عبدا إلى الله فاستجاب له، فأطاع الله فدخل الجنة وعصى الله الداعي فأدخل النار بتركه علمه واتباعه هواه وعصيانه لله. إنما هما اثنان: اتباع الهوى وطول الأمل، فأما اتباع الهوى فيصد عن الحق وأما طول الأمل فينسي الآخرة.</p>
<p>And the scholars are of two types – A scholar who acts in accordance with his knowledge, so he will be saved; and a scholar who ignores his knowledge, so he will perish.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the Fire will be adversely affected from the pungent smell of the scholar who did not act on his knowledge. And the most remorseful of the inhabitants of the Fire and regretful man will be the man who called the servants to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> so they answered his call, so they obeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and entered the Paradise, but the caller (himself) disobeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, so he entered the Fire by not acting on his knowledge and following his desires and disobeying Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>And (destroyed ones) are of two types, following desires (cravings) and having long hopes. As for following ambitions, these will turn him away from the truth, and as for long hopes, these will make him forget the Hereafter.</p>
<p>إن الدنيا قد ترحلت مدبرة وإن الآخرة قد ترحلت مقبلة، ولكل منهما بنون، فكونوا من أبناء الآخرة إن استطعتم ولا تكونوا من أبناء الدنيا، فإنما اليوم عمل ولا حساب وغدا حساب ولا عمل.</p>
<p>(Be aware!) the world is turning away and the Hereafter is approaching from the front, and for each one of them have the followers (sons). So be the sons of the Hereafter and as much as you can and do not be of the sons of the world, for today is the day of action and not of questioning, and tomorrow is for reckoning and not for action.</p>
<p><strong><u>كيف تبدأ الفتن </u></strong></p>
<p>وإنما ابتداء وقوع الفتن من أهواء تتبع وأحكام تبتدع، يخالف فيها حكم الله، يتولى فيها رجال رجالا ويتبرء رجال من رجال. ألا إن الحق لو خلص لم يكن فيه اختلاف وإن الباطل لو خلص لم يخف على ذي حجى، ولكن يؤخذ من هذا ضغث ومن هذا ضغث فيمزجان فيحسبان معا، فهنالك استولى الشيطان على أوليائه ونجا الذين سبقت لهم منا الحسنى.</p>
<h2 id="how-fitna-starts" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc335645078"></a><a name="_Toc341095516"></a>How ‘Fitna’ starts</h2>
<p>But rather, the ‘Fitna’ starts occurring from the following of desires and innovated rules thereby opposing the Judgements of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. It makes a man befriend a man and a man to keep away from a man (divisions and disgust). Nay! If the truth (is presented) in its pure form there will be no differences, and if falsehood (is presented) in its pure form, it would not remain hidden to the one with proofs, but they take a fistful from this and a fistful from that and they blend them and counted together. So that is where the Satan<sup>-la</sup> gets control (and wins) his friends, but only those to whom our<sup>-asws</sup> good (Ahadith)<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a> reach are saved.</p>
<p>إني سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: كيف بكم إذا لبستكم فتنة يربو فيها الوليد ويزيد فيها الكبير، يجري الناس عليها فيتخذونها سنة، فإذا غير منها شيئ قيل: (إن الناس قد أتوا منكرا) ثم يشتد البلاء وتسبى الذرية وتدقهم الفتن كما تدق النار الحطب وكما تدق الرحى بثفالها، يتفقه الناس لغير الدين ويتعلمون لغير العمل ويطلبون الدنيا بعمل الآخرة.</p>
<p>I<sup>-asws</sup> heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say: ‘What will be your state when you are clothed with ‘Fitna’ in which the new born and the young will go beyond (the age of) the elders. The people will flow to them (the misguided) taking to their ways, if someone will try to revert back (to Sunnah). It will be said that, ‘The people have become deniers’.</p>
<p>Then the afflictions will intensify and the offspring (of Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup>) will be targeted and the ‘Fitna’ would crush the believers as the fire consumes the wood, and like the upper stone of the hand mill grinds the lower stone of it. The people will ponder over matters other than Religion and will learn for other than acting upon it, and will be seeking the world instead of seeking the Hereafter.</p>

If I<sup>-asws</sup> were to get the people to leave these and convert these back to what they used to be in the era of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, my army would disperse from me<sup>-asws</sup> to the extent that there will not remain in my soldiers anyone apart from myself<sup>-asws</sup> and a few from my<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites who have recognised my<sup>-asws</sup> status and my<sup>-asws</sup> Imamate (Divine Authority) from the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, not from other than these two.</p>
<p>أرأيتم لو أمرت بمقام إبراهيم عليه السلام فرددته إلى المكان الذي وضعه فيه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، ورددت فدك إلى ورثة فاطمة عليها السلام، ورددت صاع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ومده إلى ما كان، وأمضيت قطائع أقطعها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لأهلها ورددت دار جعفر بن أبي طالب إلى ورثته وهدمتها من المسجد، ورددت قضايا من قضى من كان قبلي بجور، ورددت ما قسم من أرض خيبر، ومحوت ديوان الأعطية وأعطيت كما كان يعطي رسول الله (ص).

<p>Do you all see that if I<sup>-asws</sup> ordered to have the Maqaam-e-Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup> returned back to the place where the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had placed it before (after conquering Mecca), and returned the Fadak to the inheritors of Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, and returned to the ‘Sa’a’ of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and his<sup>-saww</sup> ‘Mudd’ to what it was, and cut-off (the benefits) from those that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had cut-it off from, and return the house of Ja’far<sup>-as</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-as</sup> to his<sup>-as</sup> inheritors while removing it from the Masjid<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>, and reject the judgements for the ones who were judged unfairly, and return what was wrongly taken the land of Khyber, and erase the register of gifts and gift it in accordance with what was gifted by the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>And I<sup>-asws</sup> do not make it to be between the rich, and captivate the children of the Clan of Taghlub, and order the people to not gather in the Month of Ramadhan except for the obligatory Prayers<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>, some of the people from the army – from those that fought alongside me<sup>-asws</sup> – will call out, ‘O people of Islam, he<sup>-asws</sup> has altered the Sunnah of Umar and is preventing us from ‘voluntary’ Praying in the Month of Ramadhan’ to the extent that I<sup>-asws</sup> fear that there will be a revolt in my<sup>-asws</sup> army.</p>

<p>أبان عن سليم قال: شهدت أبا ذر مرض مرضا على عهد عمر في إمارته، فدخل عليه عمر يعوده وعنده أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام وسلمان والمقداد، وقد أوصى أبو ذر إلى علي عليه السلام وكتب وأشهد.</p>
<p>Aban from Sulaym, who said, ‘I saw Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> when he<sup>-ra</sup> was ill during the era of Umar, at his<sup>-ra</sup> house. Umar came up to him<sup>-ra</sup> and in his<sup>-ra</sup> presence were Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, and Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> had made a bequest to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and it was written and witnessed.</p>
<p>فلما خرج عمر قال رجل من أهل أبي ذر من بني عمه بني غفار: ما منعك أن توصي إلى أمير المؤمنين عمر؟ قال: قد أوصيت إلى أمير المؤمنين حقا حقا. أمرنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ونحن أربعون رجلا من العرب وأربعون رجلا من العجم، فسلمنا على علي عليه السلام بإمرة المؤمنين، فينا هذا القائم الذي سميته (أمير المؤمنين). ولا أحد من العرب ولا من الموالي العجم راجع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إلا هذا وصويحبه الذي استخلفه، فإنهما قالا: (أحق من الله ورسوله)؟ فغضب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وقال: اللهم نعم، حق من الله ورسوله، أمرني الله بذلك فأمرتكم به.</p>
<p>When Umar went out, a man from the people of Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> from the sons of his<sup>-ra</sup> uncle of the Clan of Ghaffar said, ‘What prevented you<sup>-ra</sup> from bequeathing it to the ‘Amir-ul-Momineen’ Umar?’ He<sup>-ra</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-ra</sup> have bequeathed to the truly true Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>. The Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had ordered us, and we were forty men from the Arabs and forty men from the non-Arabs. So we greeted to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> as ‘Amir-ul-Momineen’. Amongst us was this one whom you have referred to as ‘Amir-ul-Momineen’. And there was none from the Arabs or from the friends of the non-Arabs who rebuked the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> except for this one and his companion who made him to be the Caliph.</p>
<p>So the two of them said, ‘Is this the truth from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>?’ So the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> got angry and said: ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes, it is the truth from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Ordered me<sup>-saww</sup> for that and I<sup>-asws</sup> have ordered you all for it’.</p>
<p>قال سليم: فقلت: يا أبا الحسن وأنت يا سلمان وأنت يا مقداد، أتقولون كما قال أبو ذر؟ قالوا: نعم، صدق. قلت: أربعة عدول، ولو لم يحدثني غير واحد ما شككت في صدقه ولكن أربعتكم أشد لنفسي وبصيرتي. قلت: أصلحك الله، أتسمون الثمانين من العرب والموالي؟ فسماهم سلمان رجلا رجلا. فقال علي عليه السلام وأبو ذر والمقداد: (صدق سلمان) رحمة الله ومغفرته عليه وعليهم.</p>
<p>Sulaym narrated that ‘I said, ‘O Abu Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, and you O Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and you O Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, are you all saying what Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> has said?’ They said, ‘Yes, it is true’. I said, ‘There are four just ones, and had only one of them narrated to me I would not have doubted its truth, but the four of you have strengthened myself and my vision. May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Keep you well, can you name these eighty from the Arabs and the friends?’ Salman<sup>-ra</sup> named them man by man. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup> said: ‘Salman<sup>-ra</sup> has spoken the truth, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy upon him and upon them’.</p>
<p>فكان ممن سمى: أبو بكر وعمر وأبو عبيدة ومعاذ وسالم والخمسة من أصحاب الشورى، وعمار بن ياسر وسعد بن عبادة والباقي من أصحاب العقبة وأبي بن كعب وأبو ذر والمقداد، وبقية جلهم وأعظمهم من أهل بدر وأعظمهم من الأنصار، فيهم أبو الهيثم بن التيهان وخالد بن زيد أبو أيوب وأسيد بن حضير وبشير بن سعيد.</p>
<p>From those that&nbsp; he<sup>-ra</sup> (Salman) named were – Abu Bakr, and Umar, and Abu Ubeyda, and Ma’az, and Saalim, and the five of the companions of the consultative council (Al-Shura), and Amaar Bin Yaasir, and Sa’d Bin Abaada, and the remaining ones of the companions of Al-Uqba, and Ubay Bin Ka’ab, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and the remaining ones of the majority from the people of Badr and most of them were from the Helpers, among them were Abu Al-Haysam Bin Al-Tayhaan, and Khalid Bin Zayd Abu Ayyub, and Asied Bin Hazeyr, and Bashir Bin Saeed.</p>
<p>قال سليم: فأظن أني قد لقيت عامتهم فسألتهم وخلوت بهم رجلا رجلا، فمنهم من سكت عني فلم يجبني بشيئ وكتمني، ومنهم من حدثني ثم قال: أصابتنا فتنة أخذت بقلوبنا وأسماعنا وأبصارنا وذلك لما ادعى أبو بكر أنه سمع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول بعد ذلك: (إنا أهل بيت أكرمنا الله واختار لنا الآخرة على الدنيا وإن الله أبى أن يجمع لنا أهل البيت النبوة والخلافة).</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘I think I did meet most of them, so I questioned them and was alone with them man by man. From them were those who remained silent from me and did not answer me anything and concealed from me, and from them were one who narrated to me and said, ‘We were afflicted by ‘Fitna’ which grabbed our hearts, and our ears, and our eyes, and that was when Abu Bakr claimed that he heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say after that: ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Honoured us<sup>-asws</sup>, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household and Chosen for us<sup>-asws</sup> the Hereafter instead of the world, and that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Refused to gather for us<sup>-asws</sup> the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, the Prophet-hood and the Caliphate together’.</p>
<p>فاحتج بذلك أبو بكر على علي عليه السلام حين جيئ به للبيعة، وصدقه وشهد له أربعة كانوا عندنا خيارا غير متهمين: أبو عبيدة وسالم وعمر ومعاذ، وظننا أنهم قد صدقوا.</p>
<p>So, Abu Bakr used that as an argument against Ali<sup>-asws</sup> when he came to him<sup>-asws</sup> for the allegiance. This was ratified and testified by four who were considered to be good amongst us, not suspect – Abu Ubeyda, and Saalim, and Umar, and Ma’az, and we thought that they had spoken the truth.</p>
<p><strong><u>الصحيفة الملعونة والمعاهدة في الكعبة </u></strong></p>
<p>فلما بايع علي عليه السلام أخبرنا أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قال ما قاله، وأخبر أن هؤلاء الخمسة كتبوا بينهم كتابا تعاهدوا فيه وتعاقدوا في ظل الكعبة: (إن مات محمد أو قتل أن يتظاهروا على علي عليه السلام فيزووا عنه هذا الأمر)، واستشهد أربعة: سلمان وأبو ذر والمقداد والزبير، وشهدوا بعد ما وجبت في أعناقنا لأبي بكر بيعته الملعونة الضالة. فعلمنا أن عليا عليه السلام لم يكن ليروي عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله باطلا، وشهد له الأخيار من أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>

<p>When allegiance was taken from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> (by force) we were informed by Ali<sup>-asws</sup> that the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had said what he<sup>-asws</sup> had said, and we got the news that those five had written an agreement between them and committed themselves to it, and contracted it in the shadow of the Kaaba that, if Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> were to pass away or be killed they would overpower Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and keep the matter (Caliphate) away from him<sup>-asws</sup>, and four of them testified to this (statement of Ali<sup>-asws</sup>)– Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup> and Al-Zubayr.</p>
<p>And we realised (the Fitna), afterwards, when Abu Bakr’s accursed and erroneous allegiance was forced onto our necks. So we came to know that Ali<sup>-asws</sup> would never report from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> any falsehood, and testified to him<sup>-asws</sup> as being the best of the companions of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>

<p>So most of them said these words, ‘We reconsidered the matter after that and we remembered the words of the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> – and we heard: ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Loves four of my<sup>-saww</sup> companions and Ordered me<sup>-saww</sup> for their love and that the Paradise is eagerly awaiting them’. So we said, ‘Who are they, O Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘My<sup>-saww</sup> brother, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Vizier, and my<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Caliph in my<sup>-saww</sup> community, and the Guardian of every believer after me<sup>-saww</sup>, Ali<sup>-asws</sup> bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and Salman Al-Farsy<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad Bin Al-Aswad<sup>-ra</sup>’. And we seek Forgiveness of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and repent to Him<sup>-azwj</sup> from what we have done and come up with.</p>
<p>وقد سمعنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول قولا لم نعلم تأويله ومعناه إلا خيرا. قال صلى الله عليه وآله: ليردن علي الحوض أقوام ممن صحبني ومن أهل المكانة مني والمنزلة عندي، حتى إذا وقفوا على مراتبهم ورأوني اختلسوا دوني وأخذ بهم ذات الشمال. فأقول: يا رب، أصحابي أصحابي فيقال لي: إنك لا تدري ما أحدثوا بعدك، إنهم لم يزالوا مرتدين على أدبارهم القهقرى منذ فارقتهم.</p>
<p>And we have heard from the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying certain words that we do not understand its explanation except as good. He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘A group of my<sup>-saww</sup> companions will come to me<sup>-saww</sup> at the Fountain, and they will be those who had status with me<sup>-saww</sup> and a position, until they will pause in accordance with their ranks, and they will see me<sup>-saww</sup> and come nearer to me<sup>-saww</sup>. They will be grabbed and sent to the left. I<sup>-saww</sup> will say: ‘O Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, my<sup>-saww</sup> companions, my<sup>-saww</sup> companions! It will be said to me<sup>-saww</sup>: ‘You<sup>-saww</sup> don’t know what they have done after you<sup>-saww</sup>. They did not cease to be apostates, turning on their backs, going backwards since you<sup>-saww</sup> separated from them’.</p>
<p>ولعمرنا، لو أنا – حين قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله – سلمنا الأمر إلى علي عليه السلام وأطعناه وتابعناه وبايعناه لرشدنا واهتدينا ووفقنا، ولكن الله قضى الاختلاف والفرقة والبلاء، فلا بد من أن يكون ما علم الله وقضى وقدر.</p>
<p>And as for our affairs, had we – since the passing away of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> – submitted our affairs to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and obeyed him<sup>-asws</sup>, and followed him<sup>-asws</sup>, and paid allegiance to him<sup>-asws</sup>, he<sup>-asws</sup> would keep us on the right path, and guided us, and made us to be successful,</p>
<p>However, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Ordained it (in order to test the righteous ones) that there should be differentiation, and (due to that people are divided into) the sects and the (subjected to) afflictions. Thus it had to take place, as it was in the Knowledge of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the fate and the destiny (as per actions of the nation).</p>

<p>سليم بن قيس قال: شهدت أبا ذر بالربذة حين سيره عثمان وأوصى إلى علي عليه السلام في أهله وماله، فقال له قائل: لو كنت أوصيت إلى أمير المؤمنين عثمان. فقال: قد أوصيت إلى أمير المؤمنين حقا أمير المؤمنين علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام، سلمنا عليه بإمرة المؤمنين على عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بأمر الله. قال لنا: (سلموا على أخي ووزيري ووارثي وخليفتي في أمتي وولي كل مؤمن بعدي بإمرة المؤمنين، فإنه زر الأرض الذي تسكن إليه ولو فقدتموه أنكرتم الأرض وأهلها).</p>
<p>Sulaym Bin Qays said, ‘I saw Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> at Al-Rabza when Usman exiled him<sup>-ra</sup>, and he<sup>-ra</sup> bequeathed to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> with regards to his<sup>-ra</sup> family and his<sup>-ra</sup> belongings. Someone said to him, ‘If only you had bequeathed to Amir-ul-Momineen Usman’. He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘I<sup>-ra</sup> have bequeathed to the Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> who is the true Amir-ul-Momineen, Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>. We had greeted him<sup>-asws</sup> as Amir-ul-Momineen in the era of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> by the Order of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. He<sup>-saww</sup> said to us: ‘Greet my<sup>-saww</sup> brother, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Vizier, and my<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Caliph in my<sup>-saww</sup> community, and my<sup>-saww</sup> guardian of every believer after me<sup>-saww</sup>, as Amir-ul-Momineen, for he<sup>-asws</sup> is reason by which the earth is in a tranquil state, if you were to lose him<sup>-asws</sup> the earth would refuse to carry its inhabitants.</p>
<p>فرأيت عجل هذه الأمة وسامريها راجعا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ثم قال: حق من الله ورسوله؟ فغضب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ثم قال: (حق من الله ورسوله، أمرني الله بذلك). فلما سلمنا عليه أقبلا على أصحابهما معاذ وسالم وأبي عبيدة – حين خرجا من بيت علي عليه السلام من بعد ما سلمنا عليه – فقالا لهم: ما بال هذا الرجل، ما زال يرفع خسيسة ابن عمه وقال أحدهما: إنه ليحسن أمر ابن عمه وقال الجميع: ما لنا عنده خير ما بقي علي</p>
<p>So, I saw the calf of this community and its Samiri rebuking the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying, ‘Is this truth from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>?’ So the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> got angered by it and said: ‘It is truth from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Ordered me<sup>-saww</sup> for that’. When we had greeted him<sup>-asws</sup>, the two of them went to their companions Ma’az, and Saalim, and Abu Ubeyda – when they came out of the House of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> after having greeted him<sup>-asws</sup> – so the two of them said to them, ‘What is it with this man<sup>-saww</sup>, he<sup>-saww</sup> does not cease to elevate his<sup>-asws</sup> cousin<sup>-asws</sup>’. And one of them said, ‘He<sup>-saww</sup> always makes good the affair of his<sup>-saww</sup> cousin<sup>-asws</sup>’. And all of them said, ‘There is no good for us if Ali<sup>-asws</sup> remains (Amir-ul-Momineen)’.</p>
<p>قال: فقلت: يا أبا ذر، هذا التسليم بعد حجة الوداع أو قبلها؟ فقال: أما التسليمة الأولى فقبل حجة الوداع، وأما التسليمة الأخرى فبعد حجة الوداع. قلت: فمعاقدة هؤلاء الخمسة متى كانت؟ قال: في حجة الوداع.</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘I said, ‘O Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, was this greeting before or after the Farewell Pilgrimage?’ He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘As for the first greeting, it was before the Farewell Pilgrimage, and as for the other one, it was after the Farewell Pilgrimage’. I said, ‘When was the contract of those five made?’ He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘During the Farewell Pilgrimage’.</p>
<p>قلت: أخبرني – أصلحك الله عن الاثني عشر أصحاب العقبة المتلثمين الذين أرادوا أن ينفروا برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله الناقة، ومتى كان ذلك؟ قال: بغدير خم مقبل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله من حجة الوداع. قلت: أصلحك الله، تعرفهم؟ قال: أي والله، كلهم. قلت: من أين تعرفهم وقد أسرهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إلى حذيفة؟ قال: عمار بن ياسر كان قائدا وحذيفة كان سائقا، فأمر حذيفة بالكتمان ولم يأمر بذلك عمارا. قلت: تسميهم لي؟ قال: خمسة أصحاب الصحيفة، وخمسة أصحاب الشورى وعمرو بن العاص ومعاوية.</p>
<p>I said, ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Keep you well, inform me about the twelve (12) companions of Al-Uqba, who had covered their faces and intended to frighten the camel of the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, when did that happen?’ He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘At Ghadeer Khumm, when the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage’. I said, ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Keep you well, do you know them?’ He<sup>-ra</sup>, said, ‘Yes, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, all of them’. I said, ‘From where did you<sup>-ra</sup> come to know them and the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had told Huzayfa to keep it a secret?’ He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘Ammar Bin Yaasar was the guide and Huzayfa was the usher, so Huzayfa was ordered for concealment, but that was not the order to Ammar’. I said, ‘Can you name them for me?’ He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘Five (5) companions of the agreement, and five (5) companions of the consultative council, and Amr Bin Al-Aas and Muowiya’.</p>

<p>I said, ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Keep you well, how come Ammar and Huzayfa hesitated in their affairs after the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, when they had both seen them (companions of Al-Uqba)?’ He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘They had both apparently repented, and were remorseful after that. Their calf had made a claim for status and their Samiri had testified to them, and three (people) were with them, that they had heard the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying that. So they said, ‘Perhaps this matter happened after the first one. So they doubted with the doubters, except that these two repented and understood, and were safe’.</p>
<p>قال سليم بن قيس: فلقيت عمارا في خلافة عثمان بعد ما مات أبو ذر، فأخبرته بما قال أبو ذر. فقال: صدق أخي أبو ذر، إنه لأبر وأصدق من أن يحدث عن عمار بما لا يسمع منه. فقلت: أصلحك الله، بما تصدق أبا ذر؟ قال: أشهد لقد سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (ما أظلت الخضراء ولا أقلت الغبراء على ذي لهجة أصدق من أبي ذر ولا أبر). قلت: يا نبي الله، ولا أهل بيتك؟ قال: إنما أعني غيرهم من الناس.</p>
<p>Sulaym Bin Qays said, ‘I met Ammar during the Caliphate of Usman after Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> had passed away and informed him of what Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> had said. He said, ‘My brother Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> spoke the truth. He<sup>-ra</sup> is more righteous and truthful than to narrate from Ammar what he<sup>-ra</sup> had not heard from him’. I said, ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Keep you well, you are ratifying Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>?’ He said, ‘I hereby testify that I have heard the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say: ‘The sky has not cast a shadow, nor has the dust (ground) carried anyone who is more truthful in his words than Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, nor anyone more righteous’. So I (Ammar) said, ‘O Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, not even the People<sup>-asws</sup> of your<sup>-saww</sup> Household?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘What I<sup>-saww</sup> mean is apart from them<sup>-asws</sup>, from the (other) people’.</p>
<p>ثم لقيت حذيفة بالمدائن – رحلت إليه من الكوفة – فذكرت له ما قال أبو ذر. فقال: سبحان الله، أبو ذر أصدق وأبر من أن يحدث عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بغير ما قال.</p>
<p>Then I met Huzayfa at Mada’in – I travelled to him from Al-Kufa – so I mentioned to him what Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> had said.

<p>Abaan from Sulaym who said (it has been) narrated to me from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and narrated by Abu Al-Hajaaf Dawood Bin Abu Awf Al-Awfy (from another chain) being reported from Abu Saeed Al-Khuzry who said, ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> came up to his<sup>-saww</sup> daughter Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, while she<sup>-asws</sup> was seated, igniting a fire under her<sup>-asws</sup> saucepan in order to cook a(( meal for)) her<sup>-asws</sup> Family<sup>-asws</sup>, and Ali<sup>-asws</sup> was sleeping in an area of the house with Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> sleeping besides him<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>فقعد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مع ابنته يحدثها وهي توقد تحت قدرها ليس لها خادم، إذ استيقظ الحسن عليه السلام فأقبل على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فقال: (يا أبت، اسقني). فأخذه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ثم قام إلى لقحة كانت، فاحتلبها بيده، ثم جاء بالعلبة – وعلى اللبن رغوة – ليناوله الحسن عليه السلام.</p>
<p>So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> sat down next to his<sup>-saww</sup> daughter and she<sup>-asws</sup> was igniting the fire under her<sup>-asws</sup> saucepan, not having a servant for her<sup>-asws</sup>, when Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> woke up.

So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> took him<sup>-asws</sup> and went to the goat, milked it and came with its milk – and on the milk was some froth – Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> started drinking it.</p>
<p>فاستيقظ الحسين عليه السلام فقال: (يا أبت اسقني). فقال النبي صلى الله عليه وآله: يا بني، أخوك، وهو أكبر منك وقد استسقاني قبلك. فقال الحسين عليه السلام: (اسقني قبله) فجعل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يرقبه ويلين له ويطلب إليه أن يدع أخاه يشرب قبله، والحسين عليه السلام يأبى.</p>
<p>Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> woke up and said, ‘O father<sup>-saww</sup>, quench my<sup>-asws</sup> thirst’.

The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> tried to appease him<sup>-asws</sup> to let his<sup>-asws</sup> brother drink before him<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> would not agree.</p>
<p>فقالت فاطمة عليها السلام: يا أبت، كأن الحسن أحب إليك من الحسين؟ قال صلى الله عليه وآله: ما هو بأحبهما إلي وإنهما عندي لسواء، غير أن الحسن استسقاني أول مرة، وإني وإياك وإياهما وهذا الراقد في الجنة لفي منزل واحد ودرجة واحدة. قال: وعلي عليه السلام نائم لا يدري بشيء من ذلك.</p>
<p>Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O father<sup>-saww</sup>, it is as if Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> is more beloved to you<sup>-saww</sup> than Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘It’s not like that, I<sup>-saww</sup> love them<sup>-asws</sup> both, and both of them<sup>-asws</sup> are equal to me<sup>-saww</sup>, it’s just that Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> asked to be quenched first, and I<sup>-saww</sup>, and you<sup>-asws</sup>, and these two<sup>-asws</sup>, and this, the one<sup>-asws</sup> lying on the bed&nbsp; (Al-Raaqid) will be in the Paradise at one place and of one (same) status’.

<p><strong>1 –</strong> Abaan from Sulaym who said, ‘It reached Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> that Amro Bin Al-Aas preached to the people in Syria saying, ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> sent me to his<sup>-saww</sup> army in which were Abu Bakr and Umar, so I thought that he<sup>-saww</sup> had not sent me but to honour them. When I went to him<sup>-saww</sup>, I said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, who is the most beloved of the people to you<sup>-saww</sup>?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said, ‘Ayesha’. I said, ‘And who from the men?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said, ‘Her father’.</p>
<p>أيها الناس، وهذا علي يطعن على أبي بكر وعمر وعثمان، وقد سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (إن الله ضرب بالحق على لسان عمر وقلبه) وقال في عثمان: (إن الملائكة لتستحي من عثمان) وقد سمعت عليا وإلا فصمتا – يعني أذنيه – يروي على عهد عمر: إن نبي الله نظر إلى أبي بكر وعمر مقبلين، فقال: (يا علي، هذان سيدا كهول أهل الجنة من الأولين والآخرين ما خلا النبيين منهم والمرسلين، ولا تحدثهما بذلك فيهلكا)</p>

<p>Then, when Ibrahim<sup>-asws</sup>, the son<sup>-asws</sup> of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away, he stood up and said that, ‘Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> has become ‘Abter’ (tailless- without heir), there is no posterity to him<sup>-saww</sup>, and I establish the people against him<sup>-saww</sup> and say evil regarding him<sup>-saww</sup>.

<p><strong><u>* 3 * كيف جمع معاوية أهل الشام على الأخذ بثار عثمان </u></strong></p>
<p>قال سليم: ثم دعا معاوية قراء أهل الشام وقضاتهم فأعطاهم الأموال وبثهم في نواحي الشام ومدائنها، يروون الروايات الكاذبة ويضعون لهم الأصول الباطلة، ويخبرونهم بأن عليا عليه السلام قتل عثمان ويتبرأ من أبي بكر وعمر، وإن معاوية يطلب بدم عثمان ومعه أبان بن عثمان وولد عثمان، حتى استمالوا أهل الشام واجتمعت كلمتهم.</p>

<p>Sulaym said, ‘Then Muawiya called the reciters of Syria and its judges. So he gave them wealth and sent them in areas of Syria and its cities. They reported false reports and placed false principles for them. They informed them that Ali<sup>-asws</sup> killed Usman and disassociates (Tabarra) from Abu Bakr and Umar<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>, and that Muawiya is seeking the blood (revenge) of Usman, and with him were Abaan Bin Usman, and the children of Usman, until they used the people of Syria and gathered them on their words.</p>
<p>ولم يزل معاوية على ذلك عشرين سنة، ذلك عمله في جميع أعماله حتى قدم عليه طغام الشام وأعوان الباطل المنزلون له بالطعام والشراب، يعطيهم الأموال ويقطعهم القطائع ويطعمهم الطعام والشراب، حتى نشأ عليه الصغير وهرم عليه الكبير وهاجر عليه الأعرابي، وترك أهل الشام لعن الشيطان وقالوا: لعن علي وقاتل عثمان. فاستقر على ذلك جهلة الأمة وأتباع أئمة الضلالة والدعاة إلى النار.</p>
<p>Muawiya did not cease doing that for twenty years. That was his deed amongst all his deeds until the oppressors of Syria came up to him, and he gave the agents of falsehood food and drinks, giving them the wealth and pieces of land and the food and the drink, to the extent that the young grew up, and the grown ones became elderly, and the Bedouins migrated to him. And the people of Syria left cursing Satan<sup>-la</sup> and started cursing Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and they were saying, ‘Curse be upon Ali<sup>-asws</sup> the murderer of Usman’. The ignorant ones of the community accepted that and followed the imams of misguidance who called them to the Fire.</p>
<p>فحسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل، ولو شاء الله لجمعهم على الهدى ولكن الله يفعل ما يشاء.</p>
<p>So, sufficient for us is Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and is the best Disposer, and had He<sup>-azwj</sup> so Wished, He<sup>-azwj</sup> would have Gathered them on the guidance, but Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Does whatsoever that He<sup>-azwj</sup> so Desires.<a name="_Toc337465449"></a><a name="_Toc341095538"></a></p>

<p>Having said that, you had written to me asking me about the Arabs – whom to honour among them, and whom to humiliate, and whom to bring closer, and whom to keep away, and from whom to feel safe, and from whom to beware? And I – my brother – am the most knowledgeable one about the Arabs.</p>
<p>انظر إلى هذا الحي من اليمن، فأكرمهم في العلانية وأهنهم في الخلاء فإني كذلك أصنع بهم، أقرب مجالسهم وأريهم أنهم آثر عندي من غيرهم ويكون عطائي وفضلي على غيرهم سرا منهم لكثرة من يقاتلني منهم مع هذا الرجل.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the tribes from Al-Yemen. So honour them in public, and humiliate them when you are alone with them, for that is what I do with them. I keep them close in the gatherings and they are seen as having more prestige with me than the others, and when it comes to conveying the gifts, I give preference to others, secretly from them, for a lot of them have fought against me along with this man Ali<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>وانظر (ربيعة بن نزار)، فأكرم أشرافهم وأهن عامتهم، فإن عامتهم تبع لأشرافهم وساداتهم.</p>
<p>And keep an eye on (the tribe of) Rabi’a Bin Nazaar. So honour their noteables and humiliate their ordinary ones and ask their general public to follows their important ones and their administrators.</p>
<p>وانظر إلى (مضر) فاضرب بعضها ببعض فإن فيهم غلظة وكبرا وأبهة ونخوة شديدة، وإنك إذا فعلت ذلك وضربت بعضهم ببعض كفاك بعضهم بعضا، ولا ترض بالقول منهم دون الفعل ولا بالظن دون اليقين.</p>
<p>And keep an eye on the (tribe of Muzar). Make some of them fight against the others. For among them are those with ruggedness, and arrogance, and pomp, and severe chivalry. And in you were to do that, and strike some of them against the others, some of them would suffice for you against the others, and do not be pleased with their words without actions, and do not go by good will without having proof.</p>

<p>And keep an eye on the slaves and those who have become Muslims from the non-Arabs, so deal with them by the way of Umar Bin Al-Khattab, for he with regards to that, disgraced them and humiliated them. Let the Arabs marry them (their women) and do not let them marry (Arab women), and that the Arabs should inherit from them but they cannot inherit from the Arabs, and be short in giving them their gifts and their sustenance, and let them go forward in the battles, and repair the roads, and cut the trees, and do not let any one of them lead the Arabs in the Prayer, nor let any of them be in the front row when the Arabs are present, except when it is required to complete the row.</p>
<p>ولا تول أحدا منهم ثغرا من ثغور المسلمين ولا مصرا من أمصارهم، ولا يلي أحد منهم قضاء المسلمين ولا أحكامهم فإن هذه سنة عمر فيهم وسيرته، جزاه الله عن أمة محمد وعن بني أمية خاصة أفضل الجزاء</p>
<p>Do not let any one of them rule any area from the areas of the Muslims, nor any city from their cities, and do not let any one of them be a judge upon the Muslims or make a decision for their regulations, for this is the way of Umar with regard to them and his dealing.

<p>By my life, had not him (Abu Bakr) and his companion (Umar) done what they did, with their strength and their solidity in the Religion of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, we and the whole of this community would have ended up being the slaves of the Clan of Hashim, and they would have inherited the Caliphate, one after the other like the inheriting of the people of Kosroe (Persia) and Caesar (Rome). But, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> took it out by their hands from the Clan of Hashim, and made it to come to the Clan of Taym Bin Murra (Abu Bakr’s tribe), then Exited it to the Clan of Udayy Bin Ka’ab (Umar’s tribe), and there was no tribe in the Quresih which more abased, and more insignificant and more disgraceful than these two, nor any which was lower. So they tempted us into it, and we were more deserving of it than these two and the descendants of these two, because with us there is wealth and splendour, and we are nearer to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> than these two.</p>
<p>ثم نالها قبلنا صاحبنا عثمان بشورى ورضا من العامة بعد شورى ثلاثة أيام بين الستة، ونالها من نالها قبله بغير شورى. فلما قتل صاحبنا عثمان مظلوما نلناها به لأن من قتل مظلوما فقد جعل الله لوليه سلطانا</p>
<p>Then our companion Usman grabbed it by a ‘Shura’ (consultative council), and the satisfaction of the general public after three days of consultation between the six of them, although it was grabbed by the one it beforehand (Umar) without the consultation. So when our companion Usman was killed as an oppressed one, we grabbed it because when someone is killed as an oppressed one, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has makes his inheritor to be guardian.</p>
<p><strong><u>أمر معاوية بإهانة الأعاجم </u></strong></p>

<p>By my life, o my brother, If Umar has enacted that the blood-money compensation of a slave is to be half of that of the Arab, it was closer to piety. If I could have found a way to that, I would have begged the general public to accept it, but I am close to the era of war, so I fear the sectarianism of the people and their opposition to me. And it should suffice for you, the way of Umar regarding them, for it is a disgrace for them and humiliation. So, when this letter gets to you, humiliate the non-Arabs, and insult them, distance them, and do not ask for any help from them, and do not fulfil any of their needs.</p>
<p><strong><u>معاوية يستلحق زيادا بأبي سفيان </u></strong></p>

And had you known in those days with conviction – as you are convinced now – that you are a son of Abu Sufyan, you would have considered yourself to be among honourables, you would have disdained to be a writer at the beck at the call of the Ashariites. And you know, and we are convinced that Abu Sufyan went along with your grandfathter Umayya Bin Abd Shams for some business to Syria, so he passed by Safuriyya. He bought a slave whose son was Abdullah, and that Abu Sufyan followed the footsteps of Umayya Abd Shams.</p>
<p><strong><u>سيرة عمر في إهانة الأعاجم وسبب ذلك </u></strong></p>
<p>وحدثني ابن أبي معيط أنك أخبرته: إنك قرأت كتاب عمر إلى أبي موسى الأشعري وبعث إليه بحبل طوله خمسة أشبار، وقال له: (أعرض من قبلك من أهل البصرة. فمن وجدته من الموالي ومن أسلم من الأعاجم قد بلغ خمسة أشبار، فقدمه فاضرب عنقه) فشاورك أبو موسى في ذلك، فنهيته وأمرته أن يراجع عمر. فراجعه وذهبت أنت بالكتاب إلى عمر، وإنما صنعت ما صنعت تعصبا للموالي وأنت يومئذ تحسب أنك منهم وأنك ابن عبيد. فلم تزل بعمر حتى رددته عن رأيه وخوفته فرقة الناس فرجع. وقلت له: (ما يؤمنك – وقد عاديت أهل هذا البيت – أن يثوروا إلى علي فينهض بهم فيزيل ملكك)، فكف عن ذلك.</p>
<h2 id="dealings-of-umar-regarding-the-insult-of-the-non-arabs-and-the-reason-for-that" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337465456"></a><a name="_Toc341095545"></a>Dealings of Umar regarding the insult of the non-Arabs and the reason for that</h2>
<p>Ibn Abu Maeet has narrated to me that you had informed him that you had read a letter of Umar to Abu Musa Al-Ash’ary having sent to him a rope which was of five spans in length saying to him, ‘Present the people of Al-Basra in front of you. The ones from the slaves and those who have become Muslim from the non-Arabs who are of five spans in length, go to them and strike their necks’.</p>
<p>Abu Musa consulted with you regarding that, and you prevented it and ordered that he should refer back to Umar. So he referred back and sent you to Umar with a letter, but you had only done what you did for being prejudicial to the slaves (Shiites), and in those days you used to count yourself to be among them, but you were the son of Ubayd. You did not cease (arguing) with Umar until you repulsed him from his opinion and scared him of sectarianism within the people, so he turned back (on his decision), and you said to him, ‘What will keep you secure – and you have enmity to the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household – that there will be a revolt, and they will go to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> taking to him<sup>-asws</sup>, so your kingdom will decline’. So he (Umar) held back from that.</p>
<p>وما أعلم يا أخي إنه ولد مولود من آل أبي سفيان أعظم شؤما عليهم منك حين رددت عمر عن رأيه ونهيته عنه وخبرني أن الذي صرفت به عن رأيه في قتلهم أنك قلت: إنك سمعت علي بن أبي طالب يقول: (لتضربنكم الأعاجم على هذا الدين عودا كما ضربتموهم عليه بدءا)، وقال: (ليملأن الله أيديكم من الأعاجم ثم ليصيرن أشداء لا يفرون، فليضربن أعناقكم وليغلبنكم على فيئكم).</p>
<p>O my brother! I do not know, of a son born from the children of Abu Sufyan, who is more sinister to him than you when you repulsed Umar from his opinion and prevented him from it. He (Umar) informed me that, you influenced him to change his opinion with regards to killing them. You quoted (to Umar) from what you had heard from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> say: ‘You will be struck by the non-Arabs in this religion later on just as you are striking them in the beginning’, and he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Fill your hands from the non-Arabs, then they will become severe, not running away. So they will strike your necks and will overpower your armies’.</p>
<p>فقال لك عمر: (قد سمعت ذلك عن رسول الله، فذاك الذي حملني على الكتاب إلى صاحبك في قتلهم، وقد كنت عزمت على أن أكتب إلى عمالي في سائر الأمصار بذلك). فقلت لعمر: (لا تفعل يا أمير المؤمنين، فإنك لن تأمنهم أن يدعوهم علي إلى نصرته وهم كثير وقد علمت شجاعة علي وأهل بيته وعداوته لك ولصاحبك)، فرددته عن ذلك.</p>
<p>So Umar said to you, ‘I have heard that from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and that is why I wrote the letter to your companion for killing them, and it is a great thing to me, and that I have written to my office bearers in the rest of the cities for that’. You said to Umar, ‘Do not do it, O Amir-ul-Momineen, for you will not be secure that they will call upon Ali<sup>-asws</sup> for his<sup>-asws</sup> help, and they are many, and you are well aware of the bravery of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-asws</sup> Household and their<sup>-asws</sup> enmity towards you and your companion’, so you repulsed him from that.</p>
<p>فأخبرتني أنك لم ترده عن ذلك إلا عصبية وأنك لم ترجع عن رواية جبنا. وحدثتني أنك ذكرت ذلك لعلي بن أبي طالب في إمارة عثمان فأخبرك (أن أصحاب الرايات السود التي تقبل من خراسان هم الأعاجم، وأنهم الذين يغلبون بني أمية على ملكهم ويقتلونهم تحت كل حجر وكوكب).</p>
<p>So you informed me that you did not repulse him from that except for nervousness and you did not turn back due to cowardice. And you informed me that you mentioned that to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> during the era of Usman, so he informed you that: ‘The companions of the black banners will come to you from Khorasaan, who are the non-Arabs, and they are the ones who will overcome the Clan of Umayya on their kingdom, and they will kill them under every stone and blade of grass.</p>
<p>فلو كنت – يا أخي – لم ترد عمر عن رأيه لجرت سنة ولاستأصلهم الله وقطع أصلهم وإذا لاستنت به الخلفاء من بعده حتى لا يبقى منهم شعر ولا ظفر ولا نافخ نار، فإنهم آفة الدين</p>
<p>Had you not – O my brother – stopped Umar from his opinion, his way would have flowed, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> would have Eradicated them and Cut off their origins, and the Caliphs to come after him would have made it to be their policy until not a single heir of them would have remained, not even a finger nail, and no one to inflame the fire, for they are a scourge for the religion.</p>
<p><strong><u>بدع عمر على لسان معاوية </u></strong></p>
<p>فما أكثر ما قد سن عمر في هذه الأمة بخلاف سنة رسول الله، فتابعه الناس عليها وأخذوا بها، فتكون هذه مثل واحدة منهن. فمنهن تحويله المقام من الموضع الذي وضعه فيه رسول الله، وصاع رسول الله ومده حين غيره وزاد فيه، ونهيه الجنب عن التيمم، وأشياء كثيرة سنها أكثر من ألف باب، أعظمها وأحبها إلينا وأقر ها لأعيننا زيلة الخلافة عن بني هاشم وهم أهلها ومعدنها، لأنها لا تصلح إلا لهم ولا تصلح الأرض إلا بهم.</p>

<p>I have (no count) of the numerous things Umar has enacted in this community in opposition to the Sunnah of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, so the people followed these and took (as a religion). So, this one would also have become one of these. From these is the transference of Al-Maqaam (E Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup>) from the place where the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had placed it, and the Sa’a of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and his<sup>-saww</sup> Mudda, altering it and increasing it, and the prevention of Al-Junub (one in requirement of major ablution) from performing the Tayammum.</p>
<p>There are many things of his ways which have more than a thousand chapter (of innovations). The greatest and the most beloved to us, and the coolness for our eyes is the snatching of the Caliphate from the Clan of Hashim, and they were its deserving ones and its mines, because it is not suitable except for them<sup>-asws</sup>, and the earth is not suitable except by them<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>

<p>Abaan from Sulaym who said, ‘I heard Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad, and I asked Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> about that’. So he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘They spoke the truth’.</p>
<p>قالوا: دخل علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وعائشة قاعدة خلفه وعليها كساء والبيت غاص بأهله فيهم الخمسة أصحاب الكتاب والخمسة أصحاب الشورى.</p>
<p>They said, ‘Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> came up to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and Ayesha was seated behind him<sup>-saww</sup>, and she had a blanket on her, and the house was full of its family members.

<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> could not find any space, so the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> gestured to him saying: ‘Over here!’ Meaning, behind him<sup>-saww</sup>.

<p><strong><u>* 1 * رسالة من معاوية إلى أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>إن معاوية دعا أبا الدرداء ونحن مع أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام بصفين ودعا أبا هريرة فقال لهما: انطلقا إلى علي فاقرآه مني السلام وقولا له: والله إني لأعلم أنك أولى الناس بالخلافة وأحق بها مني، لأنك من المهاجرين الأولين وأنا من الطلقاء وليس لي مثل سابقتك في الإسلام وقرابتك من رسول الله وعلمك بكتاب الله وسنة نبيه.</p>

<p>Muawiya called for Abu Al-Darda, and we were with Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> at Siffeen, and called Abu Hureira, so he said to the both of them, ‘Go to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and convey my greetings to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and say to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I am well aware that you<sup>-asws</sup> are first of the people for the Caliphate and more deserving of it than me, because you<sup>-asws</sup> are from the earlier Emigrants whilst I am from the <em>Tulaqa</em> (freed captives), and there is nothing for me like your precedence in Al-Islam, and your<sup>-asws</sup> closeness to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and your<sup>-asws</sup> knowledge of the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>ولقد بايعك المهاجرون والأنصار بعد ما تشاوروا فيك قبل ثلاثة أيام. ثم أتوك فبايعوك طائعين غير مكرهين. وكان أول من بايعك طلحة والزبير، ثم نكثا بيعتك وظلماك وطلبا ما ليس لهما، وأنا ابن عم عثمان والطالب بدمه.</p>
<p>And the Emigrants and the Helpers have paid allegiance to you<sup>-asws</sup> after having consulted for three days. Then they gave it to you. So they have paid allegiance to you willingly, not with abhorrence. And the first ones of those that paid allegiance to you<sup>-asws</sup> were Talha and Al-Zubayr, then they broke their allegiance to you<sup>-asws</sup>, and oppressed you<sup>-asws</sup>, and they had both sought that which was not for them, and I am the son of the uncle of Usman and seeking (to avenge) his blood.</p>
<p>وبلغني أنك تعتذر من قتل عثمان وتتبرأ من دمه، وتزعم أنه قتل وأنت قاعد في بيتك، وأنك قلت حين قتل – واسترجعت -: (اللهم لم أرض ولم أمالئ)، وقلت يوم الجمل حين نادوا (يا لثارات عثمان) – حين ثار من حول الجمل – قلت: (كب قتلة عثمان اليوم لوجوههم إلى النار، أنحن قتلناه؟ وإنما قتله هما وصاحبتهما وأمروا بقتله وأنا قاعد في بيتي).</p>
<p>And it has reached me that you<sup>-asws</sup> excused yourself<sup>-asws</sup> from the killing of Usman and distanced yourself<sup>-asws</sup> from his blood, and are claiming that when he was killed, you<sup>-asws</sup> were seated in your<sup>-asws</sup> house. And when he was killed – and you<sup>-asws</sup> recalled (We are from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and to Him<sup>-azwj</sup> we return) you<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> am not pleased, and it is not of my<sup>-asws</sup> deeds’. And you<sup>-asws</sup> said on the Day of the Camel (Al-Jamal) when it was announced, ‘O avengers of Usman!’ – when the rebels were around the camel – you<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Those who killed Usman have been flung with their faces into the Fire, have we<sup>-asws</sup> killed him?’ But rather he was killed by the two of them and their female companion, who ordered for his killing, whilst I<sup>-asws</sup> was seated in my<sup>-asws</sup> house’.</p>
<p>وأنا ابن عم عثمان ووليه والطالب بدمه، فإن كان الأمر كما قلت فأمكنا من قتلة عثمان وادفعهم إلينا نقتلهم بابن عمنا، ونبايعك ونسلم إليك الأمر.</p>
<p>And I am the son of the uncle of Usman, and his guardian and am the seeker of his blood. So if the matter was as you<sup>-asws</sup> say it to be, if it is possible, hand over to us the ones who killed Usman so that we call kill them for the son of our uncle, and we will pay allegiance to you<sup>-asws</sup> and submit the matter (Caliphate) to you<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>

<p>This is one thing, and as for the second, my spies have given me the news and the letter from the friends of Usman – from among those who are fighting alongside you<sup>-asws</sup>, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are counting them to be on your<sup>-asws</sup> side and being pleased with (them being submitted to) your<sup>-asws</sup> command, but they fancy us and their hearts are with us whilst their bodies are with you<sup>-asws</sup> – You<sup>-asws</sup> apparently display the friendship of Abu Bakr and Umar and invoking Mercy on them both, but pause the same for Usman, and do not mention him, and you are not invoking Mercy for him, nor do you<sup>-asws</sup> curse him.</p>
<p>وبلغني عنك: أنك إذا خلوت ببطانتك الخبيثة وشيعتك وخاصتك الضالة المغيرة الكاذبة تبرأت عندهم من أبي بكر وعمر وعثمان ولعنتهم. وادعيت أنك خليفة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في أمته ووصيه فيهم، وأن الله فرض على المؤمنين طاعتك وأمر بولايتك في كتابه وسنة نبيه، وأن الله أمر محمدا أن يقوم بذلك في أمته، وأنه أنزل عليه: (يا أيها الرسول بلغ ما أنزل إليك من ربك وإن لم تفعل فما بلغت رسالته والله يعصمك من الناس) ،</p>
<p>And it has reached me from you<sup>-asws</sup> that, when you<sup>-asws</sup> are alone with your<sup>-asws</sup> malicious associates, and your<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites, and your<sup>-asws</sup> special ones, the misguided thieves and liars, you<sup>-asws</sup> distance yourself<sup>-asws</sup> from Abu Bakr, and Umar, and Usman and curse them all. And you<sup>-asws</sup> are claiming that you<sup>-asws</sup> are the Caliph of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> in his<sup>-saww</sup> community, and his<sup>-saww</sup> successor among them, and that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Obligated obedience to you<sup>-asws</sup> upon the believers and Ordered for your<sup>-asws</sup> ‘Wilayah’ in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and the Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Ordered Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> that he<sup>-saww</sup> should establish that in his<sup>-saww</sup> community, and it was Sent down upon him<sup>-saww</sup> <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[5:67] O Messenger! Deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord; and if you do it not, then you have not delivered His message, and Allah will protect you from the people”</em></strong>.</p>
<p>فجمع أمته بغدير خم فبلغ ما أمر به فيك عن الله، وأمر أن يبلغ الشاهد الغائب، وأخبرهم أنك أولى بهم من أنفسهم، وأنك منه بمنزلة هارون من موسى.</p>
<p>So he<sup>-saww</sup> gathered his<sup>-saww</sup> community at Ghadeer Khumm and preached what he<sup>-saww</sup> had been Ordered to with regards to it from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and ordered that those who were present should make it reach to those who were absent, and informed them that you<sup>-asws</sup> are higher to them than their own selves, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are from him<sup>-saww</sup> of the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had from Musa<sup>-as</sup>’.</p>
<p><strong><u>غصب الخلافة على لسان معاوية </u></strong></p>

<p>And it has reached me about you<sup>-asws</sup>, that you<sup>-asws</sup> never preach to the people except that you<sup>-asws</sup> say before descending from your<sup>-asws</sup> Pulpit: ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> am higher to the people than their own selves, and I<sup>-asws</sup> have never ceased to be oppressed since the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away’. If it was as it has reached me from you<sup>-asws</sup> from that as truth, so the injustice of Abu Bakr and Umar towards you<sup>-asws</sup> is greater than the injustice of Usman.</p>
<p>لقد قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ونحن شهود، فانطلق عمر وبايع أبا بكر وما استأمرك ولا شاورك، ولقد خاصم الرجلان بحقك وحجتك وقرابتك من رسول الله، ولو سلما لك وبايعاك لكان عثمان أسرع الناس إلى ذلك لقرابتك منه وحقك عليه لأنه ابن عمك وابن عمتك.</p>
<p>The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had passed away and we were witnesses, so Umar paid allegiance to Abu Bakr and did not ask you<sup>-asws</sup>, nor did he consult with you<sup>-asws</sup>. And the two men argued by your<sup>-asws</sup> rights, and your<sup>-asws</sup> proofs, and your<sup>-asws</sup> closeness to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. Had they submitted to you<sup>-asws</sup>, and paid allegiance to you, Usman would have been the easiest of the people to come to that due to the closeness of his relation to you<sup>-asws</sup> than them, and your<sup>-asws</sup> right to him, because he is the son of your<sup>-asws</sup> uncle and your<sup>-asws</sup> aunt.</p>
<p>ثم عمد أبو بكر فردها إلى عمر عند موته ما شاورك ولا استأمرك حين استخلفه وبايع له. ثم جعلك عمر في الشورى بين ستة منكم وأخرج منها جميع المهاجرين والأنصار وغيرهم، فوليتم ابن عوف أمركم في اليوم الثالث حين رأيتم الناس قد اجتمعوا واخترطوا سيوفهم وحلفوا بالله (لئن غابت الشمس ولم تختاروا أحدكم ليضربن أعناقكم ولينفذن فيكم أمر عمر ووصيته)، فوليتم أمركم ابن عوف، فبايع عثمان فبايعتموه.</p>
<p>Then Abu Bakr deliberately returned it (caliphate) to Umar before his death. He did not consult with you<sup>-asws</sup> nor did he ask you when he made him a Caliph and sought allegiance to him. Then Umar made you<sup>-asws</sup> to be in the consultation council (Al-Shura) between the six of you, and kept out from it all the Emigrants and the Helpers, and others. So Ibn Awf was made to be in charge of your affair on the third day, when you all saw the people had gathered and drawn their swords and had taken an oath upon Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> that if the suns sets and you all had not chosen one of you, they would strike your necks and would carry out with regard to you, the condition of Umar. The one in charge of your affair, Ibn Awf, paid allegiance to Usman. So you<sup>-asws</sup> (all) had to surrender your rights and (had to give) allegiance to him.</p>
<p>ثم حوصر عثمان فاستنصركم فلم تنصروه ودعاكم فلم تجيبوه، وبيعته في أعناقكم وأنتم يا معاشر المهاجرين والأنصار حضور شهود. فخليتم عن أهل مصر حتى قتلوه وأعانهم طوائف منكم على قتله وخذله عامتكم، فصرتم في أمره بين قاتل وآمر وخاذل.</p>
<p>Then Usman was besieged, so he asked for your<sup>-asws</sup> help. But you<sup>-asws</sup> did not help him, and he called out to you<sup>-asws</sup>, and you<sup>-asws</sup> did not answer his call, and he had a right (due to being caliph) upon your<sup>-asws</sup> neck, and upon yours, O group of Emigrants and the Helpers who were present and witnessed it.</p>
<p>You<sup>-asws</sup> left him along with the people of Egypt until they killed him, and your sects from among you helped them on his killing, and most of you abandoned him. So you<sup>-asws</sup> became, with regards to his matter, between a murderer and a deserter.</p>
<p>ثم بايعك الناس وأنت أحق بهذا الأمر مني، فأمكني من قتلة عثمان حتى أقتلهم، وأسلم الأمر لك وأبايعك أنا وجميع من قبلي من أهل الشام.</p>
<p>Then the people paid allegiance to you<sup>-asws</sup> and you<sup>-asws</sup> are more deserving of this matter than me. So hand over the ones who killed Usman so that I can kill them, and submit the command (Caliphate) to you<sup>-asws</sup>, and I will pay allegiance to you<sup>-asws</sup>, and so will all those who are confronting you, from the people of Syria.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 2 * رسالة من أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام إلى معاوية </u></strong></p>
<p>فلما قرأ علي عليه السلام كتاب معاوية وأبلغه أبو الدرداء وأبو هريرة رسالته ومقالته، قال علي عليه السلام لأبي الدرداء: قد أبلغتماني ما أرسلكما به معاوية، فاسمعا مني ثم أبلغاه عني كما أبلغتماني عنه وقولا له: إن عثمان بن عفان لا يعدو أن يكون أحد رجلين: إما إمام هدى حرام الدم واجب النصرة لا تحل معصيته ولا يسع الأمة خذلانه، أو إمام ضلالة حلال الدم لا تحل ولايته ولا نصرته. فلا يخلو من إحدى الخصلتين.</p>
<h2 id="2-letter-from-amir-ul-momineen-asws-to-muawiya" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337465466"></a><a name="_Toc341095555"></a>2 – Letter from Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> to Muawiya</h2>
<p>When Ali<sup>-asws</sup> read the letter of Muawiya which had been brought by Abu Al-Darda and Abu Hureira, his message and his words, Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said to Abu Al-Darda: ‘The two of you have brought to me what Muawiya had sent you two with, so hear from me<sup>-asws</sup>, then take it from me<sup>-asws</sup> to him just as you two brought it to me, and say to him that: ‘Usman Bin Affan was nothing more than one of the two men – an imam of guidance (shedding of) whose blood was forbidden, and helping him was obligatory, and it was not permissible to disobey him, nor was there any leeway for abandoning him; or he was an imam of misguidance, (the shedding of) whose blood was permissible, and befriending him and helping him was not permissible. So he was not devoid of one of the two characteristics.</p>
<p>والواجب في حكم الله وحكم الإسلام على المسلمين بعد ما يموت إمامهم أو يقتل – ضالا كان أو مهتديا، مظلوما كان أو ظالما، حلال الدم أو حرام الدم – أن لا يعملوا عملا ولا يحدثوا حدثا ولا يقدموا يدا ولا رجلا ولا يبدءوا بشيئ قبل أن يختاروا لأنفسهم إماما عفيفا عالما ورعا عارفا بالقضاء والسنة، يجمع أمرهم ويحكم بينهم ويأخذ للمظلوم من الظالم حقه ويحفظ أطرافهم ويجبي فيئهم ويقيم حجهم وجمعتهم ويجبي صدقاتهم.</p>
<p>And the Obligation in the Judgement of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the judgement upon the Muslims, after the death of their imam or his murder – be he upon error or on guidance, an oppressed one or an oppressor, (shedding of) whose blood was permissible or prohibited – is that they should neither take any action, nor make any event to happen, nor proceed with their hands or their feet, nor initiate anything before choosing for themselves an imam who is a chaste, devout, scholar and has the understanding of the judgements and the Sunnah. He will gather for them their affairs and he judges between them and takes the rights of the oppressed one from the oppressor, and protects them, and levies their taxes (Fey), and establishes their arguments and their congregations, and levies their Charities (Sadaqa).</p>
<p>ثم يحتكمون إليه في إمامهم المقتول ظلما ويحاكمون قتلته إليه ليحكم بينهم بالحق: فإن كان إمامهم قتل مظلوما حكم لأوليائه بدمه، وإن كان قتل ظالما نظر كيف الحكم في ذلك.</p>
<p>Then he will be judging with regards to their imam who had been killed unjustly, and he will pass a judgement against the killer, judging between them with the truth. So if their Imam was killed as an oppressed one, the judgement will be for his guardians for his blood, and if he was killed whilst being an oppressor, he will consider how the judgement will be with regards to that.</p>
<p>هذا أول ما ينبغي أن يفعلوه: أن يختاروا إماما يجمع أمرهم – إن كانت الخيرة لهم – ويتابعوه ويطيعوه. وإن كانت الخيرة إلى الله عز وجل وإلى رسوله فإن الله قد كفاهم النظر في ذلك والاختيار، ورسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قد رضي لهم إماما وأمرهم بطاعته واتباعه وقد بايعني الناس بعد قتل عثمان، بايعني المهاجرون والأنصار بعد ما تشاوروا في ثلاثة أيام، وهم الذين بايعوا أبا بكر وعمر وعثمان وعقدوا إمامتهم، ولى ذلك أهل بدر والسابقة من المهاجرين والأنصار، غير أنهم بايعوهم قبلي على غير مشورة من العامة وإن بيعتي كانت بمشورة من العامة.</p>
<p>This is first (issue) that they should try to resolve by agreeing on an Imam who would gather their affairs, and he is their kind care taker and they should follow him and obey him. However, the choice of an Imam is from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic, and for His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger, so Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is Sufficient for Considering with regards to that Choice, and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had chosen for them an Imam<sup>-asws</sup> and ordered them for being obedient to him<sup>-asws</sup> and to follow him<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>And the people had paid allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup> after the killing of Usman. So did the Emigrants and the Helpers after having consulted for three days, and they are the ones who had paid allegiance to Abu Bakr, and Umar, and Usman and held on to their imamate. And that was for me<sup>-asws</sup> from the people of Badr and the former ones from the Emigrants and the Helpers, except that they had paid allegiance before me without consulting the general public, and that their allegiance to me was after having consulted the general public.</p>
<p>فإن كان الله جل اسمه قد جعل الاختيار إلى الأمة وهم الذين يختارون وينظرون لأنفسهم، واختيارهم لأنفسهم ونظرهم لها خير لهم من اختيار الله ورسوله لهم، وكان من اختاروه وبايعوه بيعته بيعة هدى وكان إماما واجبا على الناس طاعته ونصرته، فقد تشاوروا في واختاروني بإجماع منهم،</p>
<p>So if Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Majestic is His<sup>-azwj</sup> Name, had Made the choice to be for the community to make, and they are the ones who will be choosing, and considering for themselves, and that their choosing and considering for themselves for it is better for them than the Choice of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup> for them, and that the one whom they had chosen, and paid allegiance to with an allegiance of guidance, and he would be an Imam the obedience to whom would be obligatory upon the people, and to help him. So they have consulted with regards to me<sup>-asws</sup> and chosen me<sup>-asws</sup> by consensus among them.</p>
<p>وإن كان الله عز وجل هو الذي يختار، له الخيرة فقد اختارني للأمة واستخلفني عليهم وأمرهم بطاعتي ونصرتي في كتابه المنزل وسنة نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله فذلك أقوى لحجتي وأوجب لحقي.</p>
<p>And if it was Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Who would be the One to Choose, and the choice was for Him<sup>-azwj</sup> to Make, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> has Chosen me<sup>-asws</sup> for the community, and Made me<sup>-asws</sup> to be the Caliph over them and Ordered them to be obedient to me<sup>-asws</sup> and to help me<sup>-asws</sup>, in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Revealed Book, and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>. So that is a stronger argument for me<sup>-asws</sup> and more than Obligates my<sup>-asws</sup> right.</p>
<p>ولو أن عثمان قتل على عهد أبي بكر وعمر كان لمعاوية قتالهما والخروج عليهما للطلب؟ قال أبو هريرة وأبو الدرداء: لا. قال علي عليه السلام: فكذلك أنا فإن قال معاوية: (نعم)، فقولا: إذا يجوز لكل من ظلم بمظلمة أو قتل له قتيل أن يشق عصى المسلمين ويفرق جماعتهم ويدعو إلى نفسه، مع أن ولد عثمان أولى بطلب دم أبيهم من معاوية.</p>
<p>And if Usman had been killed during the era of Abu Bakr or Umar, would Muawiya had fought against the two of them and come out against them both for seeking (the blood)?’ Abu Hureira and Abu Al-Darda said, ‘No’. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘So my<sup>-asws</sup> (position) is similar to that. If Muawiya says, ‘Yes’, say to him, ‘It would then become permissible for everyone who has been oppressed by an oppressor or killed by a killer, to created discord among the Muslims, and cause disunity in their gatherings, and make a call to himself. Along with this, the children of Usman should be the first to claim the blood of their father, rather than Muawiya’.</p>
<p>قال: فسكت أبو الدرداء وأبو هريرة وقالا: لقد أنصفت من نفسك. قال علي عليه السلام: ولعمري لقد أنصفني معاوية إن تم على قوله وصدق ما أعطاني، فهؤلاء بنو عثمان رجال قد أدركوا ليسوا بأطفال ولا مولى عليهم، فليأتوا أجمع بينهم وبين قتلة أبيهم، فإن عجزوا عن حجتهم فليشهدوا لمعاوية بأنه وليهم ووكيلهم وحربهم في خصومتهم.</p>
<p>(Sulaym) said, ‘Abu Al-Darda and Abu Hureira were silent for a while and said, ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> have been equitable from yourself<sup>-asws</sup>’. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘By my<sup>-asws</sup> life, Muawiya would have done justice to me if he would have kept to his words and been truthful to what he gives to me<sup>-asws</sup>. Here are the sons of Usman, men who have understanding, and there are no children among them nor is there a guardian over them. So come, I<sup>-asws</sup> will gather them along with the killers of their father, so if they get tired from arguing against them, let them testify that Muawiya is a guardian for them, and their representative, and fight against them for their disagreements.</p>
<p>وليقعدوا هم وخصمائهم بين يدي مقعد الخصوم إلى الإمام والوالي الذي يقرون بحكمه وينفذون قضائه، وأنظر في حجتهم وحجة خصمائهم. فإن كان أبوهم قتل ظالما وكان حلال الدم أبطلت دمه، وإن كان مظلوما حرام الدم أقدتهم من قاتل أبيهم، فإن شاءوا قتلوه وإن شاءوا عفوا وإن شاءوا قبلوا الدية.</p>
<p>And let them and the defendants sit in front of me<sup>-asws</sup>, like the sitting of a litigant to the Imam<sup>-asws</sup> and the governor, whose judgement they accept and carry out his<sup>-asws</sup> judgement, and I<sup>-asws</sup> will consider their arguments and the arguments of their opponents. So if their father was killed whilst being an oppressor and it was lawful for his blood to be shed, (seeking revenge for) his blood is invalidated, and if he was an oppressed one, (the shedding of) whose blood was unlawful, I<sup>-asws</sup> will punish the one who killed their father, so if they want they can kill him, and if they want they can forgive him, and if they want they can accept the blood-money (as compensation).</p>
<p>وهؤلاء قتلة عثمان في عسكري يقرون بقتله ويرضون بحكمي عليهم ولهم، فليأتني ولد عثمان أو معاوية – إن كان وليهم ووكيلهم – فليخاصموا قتلته وليحاكموهم حتى أحكم بينهم وبينهم بكتاب الله وسنة نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله. وإن كان معاوية إنما يتجني ويطلب الأعاليل والأباطيل فليتجن ما بدا له فسوف يعين الله عليه.</p>
<p>And here are the killers of Usman in my<sup>-asws</sup> army, accepting that they killed him, and are happy with my<sup>-asws</sup> judgement, be it against them or for them. So let the sons of Usman come to me, or Muawiya – if he was their guardian or their representative – So let them present their arguments for his killing; and I<sup>-asws</sup> will judge between the two of them until I<sup>-asws</sup> judge by the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>. But Muawiya is coming to me<sup>-asws</sup> and he is seeking by the invalid reasons, so he can do whatever appears to him, for Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Help against him’.</p>
<p>قال أبو الدرداء وأبو هريرة: قد والله أنصفت من نفسك وزدت على النصفة، وأزحت علته وقطعت حجته، وجئت بحجة قوية صادقة ما عليها لوم.</p>
<p>Abu Al-Darda and Abu Hureira said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, you<sup>-asws</sup> have established the truth, and have done more than the justice, and you<sup>-asws</sup> have removed his reasons, and cut-off his arguments, and have come with strong arguments which are true and there can be no reproach against them’.</p>
<p>ثم خرج أبو هريرة وأبو الدرداء، فإذا نحو من عشرين ألف رجل مقنعين بالحديد فقالوا: (نحن قتلة عثمان ونحن مقرون راضون بحكم علي عليه السلام علينا ولنا، فليأتنا أولياء عثمان فليحاكمونا إلى أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام في دم أبيهم، فإن وجب علينا القود أو الدية اصطبرنا لحكمه وسلمنا).</p>
<p>Then Abu Hureira and Abu Al-Darda went out, and there were nearly twenty thousand men covered with the iron (armaments). They (Abu Al-No’man Bin Zamaan) said, ‘We killed Usman, and we are accepting it, and are happy with the judgement of Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, be it against us or for us. So let the guardian of Usman come to us, so that Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> can judge us with regard to the blood of their father. So if punishment is obligated upon us or the blood-money (compensation), we will bear his<sup>-asws</sup> judgement patiently, and submit to it’.</p>
<p>فقالا: قد أنصفتم، ولا يحل لعلي عليه السلام دفعكم ولا قتلكم حتى يحاكموكم إليه فيحكم بينكم وبين صاحبكم بكتاب الله وسنة نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p>So the two of them said, ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> are being fair, and it is not permissible for Ali<sup>-asws</sup> to defend you or to kill you until he<sup>-asws</sup> passes a judgement upon you. So he<sup>-asws</sup> will judge between you and your companion by the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 3 * رد فعل معاوية على رسالة أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>فانطلق أبو الدرداء وأبو هريرة حتى قدما على معاوية فأخبراه بما قال علي عليه السلام وما قال قتلة عثمان وما قال أبو النعمان بن ضمان.</p>
<h2 id="3-reaction-of-muawiya-to-the-message-of-amir-ul-momineen-asws" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337465467"></a><a name="_Toc341095556"></a>3 – Reaction of Muawiya to the message of Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup></h2>
<p>Abu Al-Darda and Abu Hureira went until they were in front of Muawiya. So they informed him of what Ali<sup>-asws</sup> had said, and what the killers of Usman had said, and what Abu Al-No’man Bin Zamaan had said.</p>
<p>فقال لهما معاوية: فما رد عليكما في ترحمه على أبي بكر وعمر وكفه عن الترحم على عثمان وبرائته منه في السر وما يدعي من استخلاف رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إياه وأنه لم يزل مظلوما منذ قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله؟ قالا: بلى، قد ترحم على أبي بكر وعمر وعثمان عندنا ونحن نسمع.</p>
<p>Muawiya said to both of them, ‘So what was his<sup>-asws</sup> response to you two with regard to invoking Mercy for Abu Bakr and Umar, and pausing from (the invocation of Mercy) for Usman, and distancing himself<sup>-asws</sup> for them in secret, and what he<sup>-asws</sup> is claiming that the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> appointed him<sup>-asws</sup> as Caliph, and that he<sup>-asws</sup> has never ceased to be an oppressed one since the passing away of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>?’ They said, ‘Yes, he<sup>-asws</sup> had Invoked for Mercy for Abu Bakr, and Umar, and Usman in our presence, and we heard it’.</p>
<p>ثم قال لنا فيما يقول: إن كان الله جعل الخيار إلى الأمة فكانوا هم الذين يختارون وينظرون لأنفسهم – وكان اختيارهم لأنفسهم ونظرهم لها خيرا لهم وأرشد من اختيار الله واختيار رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله – فقد اختاروني وبايعوني، فبيعتي بيعة هدى وأنا إمام واجب على الناس طاعتي ونصرتي، لأنهم قد تشاوروا في واختاروني.</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> said to us, from what he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘If Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Given them (the community) choice of agreeing to a leader, so they are the ones who will be choosing and considering for themselves – and their choosing for themselves and their consideration is more correct since it in accordance with the Choice of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the choice of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> – so they have chosen me<sup>-asws</sup> and have paid allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup>. So the allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup> is the allegiance of guidance, and I<sup>-asws</sup> am the Imam<sup>-asws</sup> the obedience to me<sup>-asws</sup> and helping me<sup>-asws</sup> has been Obligated upon the people, because they had consulted with regard to this and chose me<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>وإن كان اختيار الله واختيار رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله خيرا لهم وأرشد من اختيارهم لأنفسهم ونظرهم لها، فقد اختارني الله ورسوله للأمة واستخلفاني عليهم وأمراهم بنصرتي وطاعتي في كتاب الله المنزل على لسان نبيه المرسل، وذلك أقوى لحجتي وأوجب لحقي.</p>
<p>And if the Choice of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the choice of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> is better for them and more correct than their choice for themselves and their consideration of it, so Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup> have Chosen me<sup>-asws</sup> for the community, and have Appointed me<sup>-asws</sup> to be the Caliph over them, and Ordered them to help me<sup>-asws</sup> and obey me<sup>-asws</sup>, in the Revealed Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> upon the tongue of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>. And that is stronger for my<sup>-asws</sup> argument and more than Obligates my<sup>-asws</sup> rights’.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 4 * مناشدات أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام للمسلمين في صفين </u></strong></p>

<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> ascended the Pulpit within his<sup>-asws</sup> army, and gathered the people, and from those who were present from nearby, and the Emigrants and the Helpers.</p>
<p><strong><u>مناقب علي عليه السلام لا تحصى</u></strong></p>
<p>ثم حمد الله وأثنى عليه ثم قال: يا معاشر الناس، إن مناقبي أكثر من أن تحصى أو تعد، ما أنزل الله في كتابه من ذلك وما قال في رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، أكتفي بها عن جميع مناقبي وفضلي. أتعلمون أن الله فضل في كتابه الناطق، السابق إلى الإسلام – في غير آية من كتابه – على المسبوق وإنه لم يسبقني إلى الله ورسوله أحد من الأمة؟ قالوا: اللهم نعم.</p>

<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, then said: ‘O group of people! My<sup>-asws</sup> virtues are more than what can be counted or numbered. What Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Sent down in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book from that, and what the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has said regarding me<sup>-asws</sup> should suffice for you to recognise all my<sup>-asws</sup> virtues and my<sup>-asws</sup> preferences. You should know that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Preferred to Speak in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book, being the foremost in Al-Islam – in another Verse from His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book <strong><em>(56:10) And those Foremost (in Faith) will be Foremost (in the Hereafter).</em></strong> And there is no one from the community who preceded me<sup>-asws</sup> to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger?’ They said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes’.</p>
<p><strong><u>علي عليه السلام أفضل الأوصياء </u></strong></p>
<p>قال: أنشدكم الله، سئل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله عن قوله: (والسابقون السابقون أولئك المقربون) فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: أنزلها الله في الأنبياء وأوصيائهم، وأنا أفضل أنبياء الله وأخي ووصيي علي بن أبي طالب أفضل الأوصياء؟ فقام نحو من سبعين بدريا جلهم من الأنصار وبقيتهم من المهاجرين، منهم أبو الهيثم بن التيهان وخالد بن زيد أبو أيوب الأنصاري، ومن المهاجرين عمار بن ياسر وغيره، فقالوا: نشهد أنا قد سمعنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول ذلك.</p>

<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> adjure you all to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> asked the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> about His<sup>-azwj</sup> Words <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[56:10] And the foremost are the foremost, [56:11] These will be those Nearest to Allah”</em></strong>.

Among them were Abu Al-Haysam Bin Al-Tayhaan, and Khalid Bin Zayd Abu Ayyub Al-Ansaary, and from the Emigrants were Ammar Bin Yaaser and others, so they said, ‘We hereby testify that we have heard the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say that’.</p>

<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> adjure you to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> regarding the Statement of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[4:59] O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among you”</em></strong>, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Statement <strong><em>“[5:55] Only Allah is your Vali and His Messenger and those who believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow”</em></strong>, then Said <strong><em>“[5:55] Only Allah is your Guardian and His Messenger and those who believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow”</em></strong>. So the people said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, is this especially for some of the believers or general for all of them?’ Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Ordered His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup> that he<sup>-saww</sup> should teach them as to the ones<sup>-asws</sup> for whom the Verse Came down, and that he<sup>-saww</sup> should explain about the ‘Wilayah’<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> just as he<sup>-saww</sup> had explained to them their Prayers, and their Fasts, and their Zakaat, and their Pilgrimage.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></p>
<p>فنصبني بغدير خم وقال: (إن الله أرسلني برسالة ضاق بها صدري وظننت أن الناس مكذبوني، فأوعدني لأبلغنها أو يعذبني. قم يا علي).</p>
<p>So he<sup>-saww</sup> nominated me<sup>-asws</sup> at Ghadeer Khumm and said that: ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent me<sup>-saww</sup> with a Message which constricted my<sup>-saww</sup> chest and I<sup>-saww</sup> saw that the people would not believe me<sup>-saww</sup>. He<sup>-azwj</sup> Promised me<sup>-saww</sup> that I<sup>-saww</sup> should preach it or else He<sup>-azwj</sup> would Punish me<sup>-saww</sup>. Arise! O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p>ثم نادى بالصلاة جامعة، فصلى بهم الظهر، ثم قال: (أيها الناس، إن الله مولاي وأنا مولى المؤمنين وأولى بهم من أنفسهم. ألا من كنت مولاه فعلي مولاه، اللهم وال من والاه وعاد من عاداه وانصر من نصره واخذل من خذله).</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-saww</sup> called for the congregational Prayer, so we all Prayed with him<sup>-asws</sup> Al-Zohr (Midday Prayer), then said: ‘O you people! Surely Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is my<sup>-saww</sup> Master (Mawla), and I<sup>-saww</sup> am the Master of the believers and higher to them than their own selves. Beware! The one to whom I<sup>-saww</sup> am the ‘Mola’ (Master of), Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is his ‘Mola’ (Master). Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>!

<p>فقام إليه سلمان الفارسي فقال: يا رسول الله، ولاؤه كما ذا؟ فقال: (ولاؤه كولايتي، من كنت أولى به من نفسه فعلي أولى به من نفسه)، وأنزل الله تبارك وتعالى: (اليوم أكملت لكم دينكم وأتممت عليكم نعمتي ورضيت لكم الإسلام دينا). فقال سلمان الفارسي: يا رسول الله، أنزلت هذه الآيات في علي خاصة؟ فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: بل فيه وفي أوصيائي إلى يوم القيامة).</p>
<p>So Salman Al-Farsy<sup>-ra</sup> stood up in front of him<sup>-saww</sup> and said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, be submissive to him<sup>-asws</sup> like what?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Be submissive to him<sup>-asws</sup> like you<sup>-ra</sup> are submissive to me<sup>-saww</sup>. The one to whom I<sup>-saww</sup> am higher than his own self, so Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is higher to him than his own self’, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Blessed and High Sent down <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[5:3] This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My Favour on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion”</em></strong>. So Salman Al-Farsy<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, this Verse has Descended regarding Ali<sup>-asws</sup> especially?’ The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Indeed, it is regarding him<sup>-asws</sup>, and regarding my<sup>-saww</sup> successors up to the Day of Judgement’.</p>
<p>ثم قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (يا سلمان، اشهد أنت ومن حضرك بذلك وليبلغ الشاهد الغائب). فقال سلمان الفارسي: يا رسول الله، بينهم لنا. فقال: (علي أخي ووزيري ووصيي ووارثي وخليفتي في أمتي وولي كل مؤمن بعدي، وأحد عشر إماما من ولده. أولهم ابني الحسن، ثم الحسين، ثم تسعة من ولد الحسين واحدا بعد واحد. القرآن معهم وهم مع القرآن لا يفارقونه حتى يردوا علي الحوض).</p>
<p>Then the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, you and those who are present are witnesses of that, and those present should make it reach to the ones who are absent’. Salman Al-Farsy<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, explain it for us’. So he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, who is my<sup>-saww</sup> brother, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Vizier, and my<sup>-saww</sup> successor, and my<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Calliph in my<sup>-saww</sup> community, and the Guardian of every believer after me<sup>-saww</sup>, and eleven Imams<sup>-asws</sup> from his sons<sup>-asws</sup>. The first of them<sup>-asws</sup> is my<sup>-saww</sup> son Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, then Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, then nine from the sons<sup>-asws</sup> of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, one after the other. The Quran is with them<sup>-asws</sup> and they<sup>-asws</sup> are with the Quran. Neither will it separate from them<sup>-asws</sup> nor will they separate from it until they<sup>-asws</sup> return to the Fountain’.</p>
<p>فقام اثنا عشر رجلا من البدريين فقالوا: نشهد أنا سمعنا ذلك من رسول الله كما قلت سواء لم تزد فيه ولم تنقص حرفا، وأشهدنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله على ذلك. وقال بقية السبعين: قد سمعنا ذلك ولم نحفظ كله، وهؤلاء الاثنا عشر خيارنا وأفضلنا. فقال عليه السلام: صدقتم، ليس كل الناس يحفظ، بعضهم أحفظ من بعض.</p>
<p>Twelve men from the people of Badr stood up and said, ‘We testify that we heard that from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> as you<sup>-asws</sup> have said it exactly, neither have you<sup>-asws</sup> added nor you<sup>-asws</sup> have been deficient by a single letter, and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> made us witnesses on that’. And the remaining seventy said, ‘We have heard that but did not memorise all of it, and these twelve are our good ones, and the best ones of us’. So he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘You spoke the truth. It is not for all the people to be memorisers, some of them are better at memorising than others’.</p>
<p>فقام من الاثني عشر أربعة: أبو الهيثم بن التيهان وأبو أيوب الأنصاري وعمار بن ياسر وخزيمة بن ثابت ذو الشهادتين رحمهم الله، فقالوا: نشهد أنا قد سمعنا قول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وحفظناه أنه قال يومئذ وهو قائم وعلي قائم إلى جنبه. ثم قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (يا أيها الناس، إن الله أمرني أن أنصب لكم إماما ووصيا يكون وصي نبيكم فيكم وخليفتي في أمتي وفي أهل بيتي من بعدي والذي فرض الله على المؤمنين في كتابه طاعته وأمركم فيه بولايته. فراجعت ربي خشية طعن أهل النفاق وتكذيبهم، فأوعدني لأبلغها أو ليعذبني).</p>
<p>Four out of the twelve stood up – Abu Al-Haysam Bin Al-Tayham, and Abu Ayyub Al-Ansary, and Amaar Bin Yaaser, and Khuzayma Bin Sabit, the one with the two testimonies, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy of them – so they said, ‘We testify that we have heard the words of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and we have preserved it that he<sup>-saww</sup> said, one day, and he<sup>-saww</sup> was standing, and Ali<sup>-asws</sup> was standing beside him<sup>-saww</sup>. Then the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O you people! Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Ordered me<sup>-saww</sup> that I<sup>-saww</sup> should nominate for you an Imam<sup>-asws</sup> and a successor<sup>-asws</sup> who will be the successor<sup>-asws</sup> of your Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> among you, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Caliph in my<sup>-saww</sup> community, and among the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household after me<sup>-saww</sup>, and the one<sup>-asws</sup> for whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Obligated upon the believers, in His<sup>-azwj</sup> book, obedience to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and has Ordered to you all in it for his<sup>-asws</sup> ‘Wilayah’. So I<sup>-saww</sup> referred it back to my<sup>-saww</sup> Lord out of fear of the hypocrites and their belying it, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Promised me<sup>-saww</sup> that (He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Protect me<sup>-saww</sup>) but if I<sup>-saww</sup> do not preach it, he<sup>-azwj</sup> would Punish me<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p>ثم قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (أيها الناس، إن الله – جل اسمه – أمركم في كتابه بالصلاة وقد بينتها لكم وسننتها، والزكاة والصوم والحج فبينتها وفسرتها لكم، وأمركم في كتابه بالولاية وإني أشهدكم أيها الناس أنها خاصة لعلي بن أبي طالب والأوصياء من ولدي وولد أخي ووصيي، علي أولهم ثم الحسن ثم الحسين ثم تسعة من ولد الحسين ابني، لا يفارقون الكتاب ولا يفارقهم حتى يردوا علي الحوض.</p>
<p>Then the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O you people!

<p><strong><u>حديث الكساء وآية التطهير </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم قال علي عليه السلام لأبي الدرداء وأبي هريرة ومن حوله: أيها الناس، أتعلمون أن الله تبارك وتعالى أنزل في كتابه (إنما يريد الله ليذهب عنكم الرجس أهل البيت ويطهركم تطهيرا).</p>

<p>فجمعني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وفاطمة والحسن والحسين معه في كسائه وقال: (اللهم هؤلاء عترتي وخاصتي وأهل بيتي، فأذهب عنهم الرجس وطهرهم تطهيرا). فقالت أم سلمة: وأنا يا رسول الله؟ فقال: (إنك على خير، وإنما أنزلت في وفي أخي علي وابنتي فاطمة وفي ابني الحسن والحسين وفي تسعة أئمة من ولد الحسين ابني – صلوات الله عليهم – خاصة ليس معنا غيرنا). فقام كلهم فقالوا: نشهد أن أم سلمة حدثتنا بذلك، فسألنا عن ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فحدثنا به كما حدثتنا أم سلمة به.</p>
<p>So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> gathered me<sup>-asws</sup>, and Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> along with himself<sup>-saww</sup> in his<sup>-saww</sup> Blanket (Kisaa), and said: ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>!

Umm Salma<sup>-ra</sup> said: ‘And I<sup>-ra</sup>, O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>?’ So he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘You<sup>-ra</sup> are upon good, but this has Descended regarding myself<sup>-saww</sup>, and regarding my<sup>-saww</sup> brother Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and my<sup>-saww</sup> daughter Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, and regarding my<sup>-saww</sup> sons Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, and regarding nine Imams<sup>-asws</sup> from the sons<sup>-asws</sup> of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> – my<sup>-saww</sup> son<sup>-asws</sup> – Peace be upon them<sup>-asws</sup> all – especially.

<p><strong><u>الصادقون في القرآن هم الأئمة عليهم السلام </u></strong></p>

<p>قال علي عليه السلام: وقلت لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في غزوة تبوك: يا رسول الله، لم خلفتني؟ فقال: يا علي، إن المدينة لا تصلح إلا بي أو بك، وأنت مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى إلا النبوة فإنه لا نبي بعدي. فقام رجال ممن معه من المهاجرين والأنصار فقالوا: نشهد أنا سمعنا ذلك من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في غزوة تبوك.</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘And I<sup>-asws</sup> said to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> during the (military) expedition of Tabuk: ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, why did you<sup>-saww</sup> leave me<sup>-asws</sup> behind?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, Al-Medina cannot be in a correct state except by me<sup>-saww</sup> and by you<sup>-asws</sup>, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are from me<sup>-saww</sup> of the status which Haroun <sup>-as</sup> had from Musa<sup>-as</sup> except for the Prophet-hood, that there will be no Prophet<sup>-as</sup> after me<sup>-saww</sup>’.

Twelve from the group of the people of Badr stood up and said, ‘We testify that when the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> preached on the day in which he<sup>-saww</sup> passed away, Umar Bin Al-Khattab stood up angrily and said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, all the People<sup>-asws</sup> of your<sup>-saww</sup> Household?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘No, but my<sup>-saww</sup> successors<sup>-asws</sup>.

<p>And it has reached me that you<sup>-asws</sup> supplicate for them and seek Forgiveness for them, and it has for it two angles and there is no third angle to it.

<p>What they have come with and presented to me, is what I have seen you<sup>-asws</sup> with my own eyes, so I do not need to ask about that from others.

You<sup>-asws</sup> did not find among them any humans apart from four – Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Zubayr.</p>
<p>لعمري لو كنت محقا لأجابوك وساعدوك ونصروك، ولكن ادعيت باطلا وما لا يقرون به. وسمعتك أذناي وأنت تقول لأبي سفيان – حين قال لك: (غلبت يا بن أبي طالب على سلطان ابن عمك، ومن غلبك عليه أذل أحياء قريش تيم وعدي) ودعاك إلى أن ينصرك – فقلت: (لو وجدت أعوانا أربعين رجلا من المهاجرين والأنصار من أهل السابقة لناهضت هذا الرجل)، فلما لم تجد غير أربعة رهط بايعت مكرها.</p>
<p>By my life, if you<sup>-asws</sup> were on truth, they would have answered you<sup>-asws</sup> and supported you<sup>-asws</sup> and helped you<sup>-asws</sup>, but your<sup>-asws</sup> claim was false and they did not accept it. And I heard you<sup>-asws</sup> with my own ears and you<sup>-asws</sup> said to Abu Sufyan – when he said to you, ‘They have overcome the kingdom of the son<sup>-saww</sup> of your<sup>-asws</sup> uncle<sup>-as</sup>, O son of Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and the ones who have overcome you<sup>-asws</sup> are the disgraced tribes of Qureish; Taym and Ady’, and he claimed that he will help you – so you<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘If I<sup>-asws</sup> find as helpers, forty men from the Emigrants and the helpers, from the former ones, I<sup>-asws</sup> would resist this man’. So when you<sup>-asws</sup> did not find any apart from a group of four, you<sup>-asws</sup> paid allegiance abhorrently’.</p>

<p>And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, your<sup>-asws</sup> situation is not like mine<sup>-saww</sup>, in that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Ordered me<sup>-asws</sup> that I<sup>-saww</sup> should declare the truth and Informed me<sup>-saww</sup> that He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Protect me<sup>-saww</sup> from the people, and Ordered me<sup>-saww</sup> that I<sup>-saww</sup> should struggle even though I<sup>-saww</sup> may be alone. So He<sup>-azwj</sup> Said: <strong><em>“[4:84] Fight then in Allah’s way; this is not imposed on you except In relation to yourself”</em></strong>, and Said: <strong><em>“and rouse the believers to fight”</em></strong>, for I<sup>-saww</sup> and you<sup>-asws</sup> are the Holy Warriors.</p>
<p>وقد مكثت بمكة ما مكثت لم أؤمر بقتال، ثم أمرني الله بالقتال لأنه لا يعرف الدين إلا بي ولا الشرائع ولا السنن والأحكام والحدود والحلال والحرام. وإن الناس يدعون بعدي ما أمرهم الله به وما أمرتهم فيك من ولايتك وما أظهرت من حجتك، متعمدين غير جاهلين ولا اشتبه عليهم فيه، ولا سيما لما أتوك قبل&nbsp; مخالفة ما أنزل الله فيك.</p>
<p>And I<sup>-saww</sup> have stayed at Mecca (for the duration) I<sup>-saww</sup> stayed, then Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Ordered me<sup>-saww</sup> for the fighting because the Religion could not be recognised except by me<sup>-saww</sup>, nor the Law, nor the Sunnah and the Regulations, and the Limits, and the Permissibles and the Prohibition. And that the people, after me<sup>-saww</sup>, will leave what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Ordered them for, and what He<sup>-azwj</sup> Ordered them regarding you<sup>-asws</sup> from your<sup>-asws</sup> Wilayah, and what has been made apparent from your<sup>-asws</sup> arguments, deliberately, not out of ignorance or their doubts with regards to you<sup>-asws</sup>, in particular their opposition to what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Sent down regarding you<sup>-asws</sup> beforehand.</p>
<p>فإن وجدت أعوانا عليهم فجاهدهم وإن لم تجد أعوانا فاكفف يدك واحقن دمك فإنك إن نابذتهم قتلوك، وإن تبعوك وأطاعوك فاحملهم على الحق وإلا فدع، وإن استجابوا لك ونابذوك فنابذهم وجاهدهم، وإن لم تجد أعوانا فكف يدك واحقن دمك</p>
<p>So, if you<sup>-asws</sup> were to find helpers against them, fight them, and if you<sup>-asws</sup> do not find helpers, restrain your<sup>-asws</sup> hand, and save your<sup>-asws</sup> blood, for if you<sup>-asws</sup> oppose them, they will kill you<sup>-asws</sup>. And if they follow you<sup>-asws</sup> and obey you<sup>-asws</sup>, carry them towards the truth, otherwise let them be. If they respond to you<sup>-asws</sup> by opposing you<sup>-asws</sup>, so oppose them and fight them. And if you<sup>-asws</sup> do not find helpers, so restrain your<sup>-asws</sup> hand and save your<sup>-asws</sup> blood.</p>
<p>واعلم أنك إن دعوتهم لم يستجيبوا لك فلا تدعن أن تجعل الحجة عليهم. إنك يا أخي لست مثلي، إني قد أقمت حجتك وأظهرت لهم ما أنزل الله فيك وإنه لم يعلم أني رسول الله وأن حقي وطاعتي واجبان حتى أظهرت لك، فإني كنت قد أظهرت حجتك وقمت بأمرك، فإن سكت عنهم لم تأثم وإن حكمت ودعوت لم تأثم، غير أني أحب أن تدعوهم وإن لم يستجيبوا لك ولم يقبلوا منك.</p>
<p>And know that if you<sup>-asws</sup> call them and they do not answer you<sup>-asws</sup> do not let them be if you<sup>-asws</sup> have already established the argument against them. You<sup>-asws</sup>, O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother, are not (in a situation) like mine<sup>-saww</sup>. I<sup>-saww</sup> have established your<sup>-asws</sup> argument and manifested to them what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Sent down regarding you<sup>-asws</sup>, and they do not know that I<sup>-saww</sup> am the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and that my<sup>-saww</sup> rights and obedience to me<sup>-saww</sup> are both Obligatory until I<sup>-saww</sup> manifested it to you<sup>-asws</sup>, for I<sup>-saww</sup> had already manifested your<sup>-asws</sup> argument, and established it with your<sup>-asws</sup> command. So if you<sup>-asws</sup> are silent from them, you<sup>-asws</sup> will not be sinning, and that if you<sup>-asws</sup> were to order them and call, them you<sup>-asws</sup> will (still) not be sinning, but I<sup>-saww</sup> would love it if you<sup>-asws</sup> call them even though they do not respond to you<sup>-asws</sup> and do not accept from you<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>ويتظاهر عليك ظلمة قريش، فإني أخاف عليك إن ناهضت القوم ونابذتهم وجاهدتم من غير أن يكون معك فئة أعوان تقوي بهم أن يقتلوك فيطفأ نور الله ولا يعبد الله في الأرض، والتقية من دين الله ولا دين لمن لا تقية له.</p>
<p>And the Qureish will exhibit injustice to you<sup>-asws</sup>, so I<sup>-saww</sup> fear for you<sup>-asws</sup> that the people will reject you and you<sup>-asws</sup> should only oppose them and fight against them when you<sup>-asws</sup> find helpers with you<sup>-asws</sup> by whom you<sup>-asws</sup> can strengthen by, otherwise they will try to eleminate you<sup>-asws</sup>. So they would attempt to extinguish the Light of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> so that there will be no one worshipping Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> in His<sup>-azwj</sup> earth, and the dissimulation is from the Religion of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and there is no Religion to the one who has no dissimulation for him.</p>
<p>وإن الله قد قضى الفرقة والاختلاف بين هذه الأمة، ولو شاء لجمعهم على الهدى ولم يختلف اثنان منهم ولا من خلقه ولم يتنازع في شيء من أمره ولم يجحد المفضول ذا الفضل فضله، ولو شاء عجل منهم النقمة وكان منه التغيير حتى يكذب الظالم ويعلم الحق أين مصيره. والله جعل الدنيا دار الأعمال وجعل الآخرة دار الثواب والعقاب، (ليجزي الذين أساؤوا بما عملوا ويجزي الذين أحسنوا بالحسنى). فقلت: شكرا لله على نعمائه وصبرا على بلائه وتسليما ورضى بقضائه.</p>
<p>And that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Judged that there be sects and differences in this community, and had He<sup>-azwj</sup> so Desired, He<sup>-azwj</sup> would have Gathered them on Guidance and no two from them would have differed, nor would anyone from His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures would have disputed with regards to anything from His<sup>-azwj</sup> Commands, and the lower ones would not have struggled against the preferred ones for their preferences.</p>
<p>And had He<sup>-azwj</sup> so Desired, He<sup>-azwj</sup> would Hasten the Revenge, and Change them until the oppressor would be falsified and they would come to know where the truth lies. And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has made the world to be a House of deeds, and made the Hereafter to be the House of Reward and Punishment. <strong><em>“[53:31] Yea, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: so that He rewards those who do evil, according to their deeds, and He rewards those who do good, with what is best”</em></strong>. So I<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Thanks be to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for His<sup>-azwj</sup> Favours, and I<sup>-asws</sup> observe patience on His<sup>-azwj</sup> afflictions and submit to them, and I<sup>-saww</sup> am pleased with His<sup>-azwj</sup> Judgement’.</p>
<p>ثم قال صلى الله عليه وآله: يا أخي، أبشر فإن حياتك وموتك معي، وأنت أخي وأنت وصيي وأنت وزيري وأنت وارثي، وأنت تقاتل على سنتي، وأنت مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى، ولك بهارون أسوة حسنة إذ استضعفه أهله وتظاهروا عليه وكادوا أن يقتلوه.</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, receive good news for your<sup>-asws</sup> life and your<sup>-asws</sup> passing away are with me<sup>-saww</sup>, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are my<sup>-saww</sup> successor<sup>-asws</sup>, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are my<sup>-saww</sup> Vizier, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are my<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, and you<sup>-asws</sup> will fight upon my<sup>-saww</sup> Sunnah, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are from me<sup>-asws</sup> of the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had from Musa<sup>-asws</sup>, and for you<sup>-asws</sup>, with Haroun<sup>-as</sup> is the best example when his<sup>-as</sup> people considered him<sup>-as</sup> to be weak, and overcame him<sup>-as</sup> and had plotted to kill him<sup>-as</sup>.</p>
<p>فاصبر لظلم قريش إياك وتظاهرهم عليك فإنها ضغائن في صدور قوم، أحقاد بدر وترات أحد. وإن موسى أمر هارون حين استخلفه في قومه إن ضلوا فوجد أعوانا أن يجاهدهم بهم، وإن لم يجد أعوانا أن يكف يده ويحقن دمه ولا يفرق بينهم. فافعل أنت كذلك، إن وجدت عليهم أعوانا فجاهدهم وإن لم تجد أعوانا فاكفف يدك واحقن دمك، فإنك إن نابذتهم قتلوك، وإن تبعوك وأطاعوك فاحملهم على الحق.</p>
<p>So observe patience to the injustice of the Qureish towards you<sup>-asws</sup> and what they will be coming up against you<sup>-asws</sup>, for there are grudges in the hearts of the people, the malice of Badr and the animosities of Ohad. And that Musa<sup>-as</sup> had ordered Haroun<sup>-as</sup> when he<sup>-as</sup> left him<sup>-as</sup> behind among his<sup>-as</sup> people that if they go astray and he<sup>-as</sup> find helpers he<sup>-as</sup> should fight against them by these (helpers), but if he<sup>-as</sup> does not find helpers then he<sup>-as</sup> should restrain his<sup>-as</sup> hand and save his<sup>-as</sup> blood, and not create differences among them. So you<sup>-asws</sup> should do like that, and if you<sup>-asws</sup> find helpers against them, so fight against them, and if you<sup>-asws</sup> do not find helpers, so you<sup>-asws</sup> should restrain your<sup>-asws</sup> hand and save your<sup>-asws</sup> blood, for if you<sup>-asws</sup> confront them, they will kill you<sup>-asws</sup>, and if they follow you<sup>-asws</sup>, and obey you<sup>-asws</sup>, carry them to the truth.</p>
<p>واعلم أنك إن لم تكف يدك وتحقن دمك إذا لم تجد أعوانا أتخوف عليك أن يرجع الناس إلى عبادة الأصنام والجحود بأني رسول الله، فاستظهر الحجة عليهم وادعهم ليهلك الناصبون لك والباغون عليك ويسلم العامة والخاصة.</p>
<p>And know that if you<sup>-asws</sup> do not restrain your<sup>-asws</sup> hand and save your<sup>-asws</sup> blood when you<sup>-asws</sup> do not find helpers for yourself<sup>-asws</sup>, I<sup>-saww</sup> fear for you<sup>-asws</sup>, that the people will revert back to worshipping the idols and will dispute that I<sup>-saww</sup> am the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. So, show the arguments against them and call them, so that those who are <em>Nasibis</em> (hate you<sup>-asws</sup>) and the rebels against you<sup>-asws</sup> will be destroyed, whilst the general public and certain people will remain safe.</p>
<p>فإذا وجدت يوما أعوانا على إقامة الكتاب والسنة فقاتل على تأويل القرآن كما قاتلت على تنزيله، فإنما يهلك من الأمة من نصب نفسه لك أو لأحد من أوصيائك بالعداوة، وعادى وجحد ودان بخلاف ما أنتم عليه.</p>
<p>So, the day you<sup>-asws</sup> find helpers for establishing the Book and the Sunnah, fight them over the explanation of the Quran just as I<sup>-saww</sup> fought over its Revelation. But, the one from the community who harbours hatred towards you<sup>-asws</sup> (the Nasibis), or towards any one<sup>-asws</sup> from your<sup>-asws</sup> successors<sup>-asws</sup> by being inimical will perish, for they would have made it to be a Religion all that which opposes you<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>ولعمري يا معاوية، لو ترحمت عليك وعلى طلحة والزبير ما كان ترحمي عليكم واستغفاري لكم ليحق باطلا، بل يجعل الله ترحمي عليكم واستغفاري لكم لعنة وعذابا.</p>
<p>And by my<sup>-asws</sup> life, O Muawiya, if I<sup>-asws</sup> were to invoke Mercy upon you and upon Talha and Al-Zubayr, my<sup>-asws</sup> invocation towards you and my<sup>-asws</sup> seeking of Forgiveness for you would not make falsehood to be truth, but Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> would Make my<sup>-asws</sup> invocation to you and my seeking of Forgiveness for you to be a Curse and a Punishment.</p>
<p>وما أنت وطلحة والزبير بأحقر جرما ولا أصغر ذنبا وأهون بدعة وضلالة ممن استنالك ولصاحبك الذي تطلب بدمه ووطئا لكم ظلمنا أهل البيت وحملاكم على رقابنا، فإن الله يقول: (ألم تر إلى الذين أوتوا نصيبا من الكتاب يؤمنون بالجبت والطاغوت ويقولون للذين كفروا هؤلاء أهدى من الذين آمنوا سبيلا أولئك الذين لعنهم الله ومن يلعن الله فلن تجد له نصيرا أم لهم نصيب من الملك فإذا لا يؤتون الناس نقيرا أم يحسدون الناس على ما آتاهم الله من فضله)، فنحن الناس ونحن المحسودون.</p>
<p>And neither are you, or Talha and Al-Zubayr any less criminal, nor are your sins any smaller, and any lesser in your heresies (innovations) and straying from the ones who facilitated these for you (Abu Bakr and Umar) and for your companion (Usman) whose blood that you seek, and made it easy for you to oppress us<sup>-asws</sup>, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, and burdened you upon our<sup>-asws</sup> necks, for Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Said <strong><em>“[4:51] Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book has been given? They believe in idols and false deities and say of those who disbelieve: These are better guided in the path than those who believe. [4:52] Those are they whom Allah has cursed, and whomever Allah curses you shall not find any helper for him. [4:53] Or have they a share in the kingdom? But then they would not give to people even the speck in the date stone. [4:54] Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them of His grace?”</em></strong>, so we<sup>-asws</sup> are the people and we<sup>-asws</sup> are the envied ones’.</p>
<p>قال الله عز وجل: (فقد آتينا آل إبراهيم الكتاب والحكمة وآتيناهم ملكا عظيما فمنهم من آمن به ومنهم من صد عنه وكفى بجهنم سعيرا)، فالملك العظيم أن جعل الله فيهم أئمة من أطاعهم أطاع الله ومن عصاهم عصى الله والكتاب والحكمة النبوة. فلم تقرون بذلك في آل إبراهيم وتنكرونه في آل محمد؟</p>
<p>Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Says <strong><em>“[4:54] But indeed We have given to Ibrahim’s children the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them a grand kingdom. [4:55] So of them is he who believes in him, and of them is he who turns away from him, and Hell is sufficient to burn”</em></strong>, so the Great Kingdom is that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Made Imams<sup>-asws</sup> to be among them, the one who obeys them<sup>-asws</sup> has obeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who disobeys them<sup>-asws</sup> has disobeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the book, and the Wisdom, and the Prophet-hood. Why do you accept that with regards to the Progeny of Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup>, and are denying it with regards to the Progeny<sup>-asws</sup> of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>?</p>
<p>يا معاوية: فإن تكفر بها أنت وصاحبك ومن قبلك من طغاة الشام واليمن والأعراب، أعراب ربيعة ومضر جفاة الأمة، فقد وكل الله بها قوما ليسوا بها بكافرين</p>
<p>O Muawiya, so if you are denying it along with your companions, and the ones before you from the tyrants of Syria, and Yemen, and the Bedouins, the Bedouins of Rabi’a (a tribe) and Muzar (a tribe), the betrayers of the community, so Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Empowered by it a people who will not be denying it.</p>
<p>يا معاوية: إن القرآن حق ونور وهدى ورحمة وشفاء للمؤمنين والذين لا يؤمنون في آذانهم وقر وهو عليهم عمى.</p>
<p>O Muawiya, the Quran is ‘Haq’ (a Truth), and ‘Noor’ (a Light), and a Guidance, and a Mercy, and a Healing for the believers, and the ones who do not believe in their ears and accept, so it is a blindness to them.</p>
<p>يا معاوية، إن الله جل جلاله لم يدع صنفا من أصناف الضلالة والدعاة إلى النار إلا وقد رد عليهم واحتج عليهم في القرآن ونهى فيه عن اتباعهم، وأنزل فيهم قرآنا قاطعا ناطقا عليهم قد علمه من علمه وجهله من جهله.</p>
<p>O Muawiya, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Majestic is His<sup>-azwj</sup> Majesty, did not Leave any type from the variety of misguidance and the callers to the Fire except that He<sup>-azwj</sup> has Challenged (Rebutted) it and has Argued against them in the Quran, and has Forbidden it in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book to follow them, and has Sent down regarding them a Quran which cut them off and Spoken against them, so the one who knows it knows it, and the one who is ignorant of it is ignorant of it.</p>
<p>وإني سمعت من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: ليس من القرآن آية إلا ولها ظهر وبطن وما منه حرف إلا وإن له تأويل، (وما يعلم تأويله إلا الله والراسخون في العلم)، الراسخون نحن آل محمد.</p>
<p>And I<sup>-asws</sup> heard from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say: ‘There is no Verse in the Quran except that it has for it an apparent, and a hidden, and there is no letter from it except that there is an explanation for it, <strong><em>“[3:7] but none knows its interpretation except Allah, and those who are firmly rooted in knowledge”</em></strong>, The ones<sup>-asws</sup> firmly rooted in knowledge are us<sup>-asws</sup>, the Progeny<sup>-asws</sup> of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>وأمر الله سائر الأمة أن يقولوا: (آمنا به كل من عند ربنا وما يذكر إلا أولو الألباب)، وأن يسلموا لنا ويردوا علمه إلينا وقد قال الله: (ولو ردوه إلى الرسول وإلى أولي الأمر منهم لعلمه الذين يستنبطونه منهم)، هم الذين يسألون عنه ويطلبونه.</p>
<p>And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Ordered the rest of the community that they should say <strong><em>“[3:7] We believe in it, it is all from our Lord; and none do mind except those having understanding.”</em></strong> And that they should submit to us<sup>-asws</sup> and refer their knowledge to us<sup>-asws</sup>, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Said <strong><em>“[4:83] and if they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those among them who can search out the knowledge of it would have known it”</em></strong>, they<sup>-asws</sup> are the ones who should be asked about it and sought.</p>
<p><strong><u>آيتان نزلتا في معاوية </u></strong></p>
<p>لعمري لو أن الناس – حين قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله – سلموا لنا واتبعونا وقلدونا أمورهم لأكلوا من فوقهم ومن تحت أرجلهم، ولما طمعت فيها أنت يا معاوية فما فاتهم منا أكثر مما فاتنا منهم.</p>
<h2 id="two-verses-descended-regarding-muawiya" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337465479"></a><a name="_Toc341095568"></a>Two Verses Descended regarding Muawiya</h2>
<p>By my<sup>-asws</sup> life, had the people – when the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away – submitted to us<sup>-asws</sup>, and followed us<sup>-asws</sup>, and emulated us<sup>-asws</sup> (done our<sup>-asws</sup> Taqleed) in their affairs, they would have eaten from above them and from underneath their feet, from what you coveted with regards to it. O Muawiya, when you desired for the caliphate, it did not harm us<sup>-asws</sup> as much as the harm we<sup>-asws</sup> are going to get from them (referring to what would happen afterwards, shahadad of all Imams<sup>-asws</sup>).</p>
<p>ولقد أنزل الله في وفيك خاصة آية من القرآن تتلوها أنت ونظراؤك على ظاهرها ولا تعلمون تأويلها وباطنها، وهي في سورة الحاقة: (فأما من أوتي كتابه بيمينه فسوف يحاسب حسابا يسيرا) إلى قوله: (وأما من أوتي كتابه بشماله) إلى آخر الآية، وذلك أنه يدعى بكل إمام ضلالة وإمام هدى ومع كل واحد منهما أصحابه الذين بايعوه فيدعى بي ويدعى بك.</p>
<p>And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Sent down Verses from the Quran regarding myself<sup>-asws</sup> and you especially. You and those who have your vision recite it upon its apparent (meaning) and are unaware of its explanation and its hidden (Baatin), and this is in Surah Al-Haqqah <strong><em>“[69:19] Then as to him who is given his book in his right hand, [84:8] He shall be reckoned with by an easy reckoning”</em></strong> (Please note that half of the above Verse is now in Surah Al-Inshiqaaq) up to His<sup>-azwj</sup> Words <strong><em>“[69:25] And as for him who is given his book in his left hand”</em></strong> up to the end of the Verse, and that He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Call every imam of misguidance and every Imam<sup>-asws</sup> of Guidance, and along with each one of them will be his companions who paid allegiance to him. So He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Call them (my<sup>-asws</sup> companions) with me<sup>-asws</sup> and He<sup>-azwj</sup> Call them (your companions) with you.</p>
<p>يا معاوية، وأنت صاحب السلسلة الذي يقول: (يا ليتني لم أوت كتابيه ولم أدر ما حسابيه) إلى آخر القصص، والله لقد سمعت ذلك من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقوله فيك، وكذلك كل إمام ضلالة كان قبلك ويكون بعدك له مثل ذلك من خزي الله وعذابه.</p>
<p>O Muawiya, and you are <strong><em>the companion in the chains (69:32)</em></strong> who will be saying <strong><em>“[69:25] O would that my book had never been given me: [69:26] And I had not known what my account was”</em></strong> up to the end of the story (the Verses following this one). By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> have heard that from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> speaking about you, and similarly for every imam of misguidance who was before you, and the ones who will be coming after you, similar words of disgrace from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Punishment.</p>
<p><strong><u>آية نزلت في بني أمية </u></strong></p>
<p>ونزل فيكم قول الله عز وجل: (وما جعلنا الرؤيا التي أريناك إلا فتنة للناس والشجرة الملعونة في القرآن)، وذلك حين رآى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله اثني عشر إماما من أئمة الضلالة على منبره يردون الناس على أدبارهم القهقرى، رجلان من حيين مختلفين من قريش وعشرة من بني أمية، أول العشرة صاحبك الذي تطلب بدمه وأنت وابنك وسبعة من ولد الحكم بن أبي العاص، أولهم مروان، وقد لعنه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وطرده وما ولد حين استمع لنساء رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>

<p>And regarding you Descended the Statement of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic <strong><em>“[17:60] and We did not make the vision which We showed you but a tri</em></strong><strong><em>al</em></strong><strong><em> for men and the cursed tree in the Quran as well”</em></strong>, and that was when the Messenger saw (in a dream) twelve imam from the imams of misguidance upon his<sup>-saww</sup> Pulpit, reverting the people backwards upon their heels. Two men from two different tribes from Qureish, and ten from the Clan of Umayya.</p>
<p>The first of the ten is your companion whose blood you are seeking (Usman), and you, and your son, and seven from the sons of Al-Hakam Bin Abu Al-A’as, the first of them being Marwaan. And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has cursed him, and expelled him along with his son when they were intently listening in to the (conversations) of the wives of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>يا معاوية، إنا أهل بيت اختار الله لنا الآخرة على الدنيا ولم يرض لنا الدنيا ثوابا. وقد سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أنت ووزيرك وصويحبك، يقول: (إذا بلغ بنو أبي العاص ثلاثين رجلا اتخذوا كتاب الله دخلا وعباد الله خولا ومال الله دولا).</p>
<p>O Muawiya, for us<sup>-asws</sup>, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Chosen the Hereafter instead of the world, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> was not Pleased with the world as a Reward for us<sup>-asws</sup>. And you and your Vizier (Amro Al-A’as) and your companions have heard the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say: ‘When the Clan of Abu Al-A’as reach thirty men, they will take the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> to deceive by, and the servants of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as their followers, and the wealth of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for their own’.</p>
<p>يا معاوية، إن نبي الله زكريا نشر بالمنشار ويحيى ذبح وقتله قومه وهو يدعوهم إلى الله عز وجل، وذلك لهوان الدنيا على الله. إن أولياء الشيطان قديما حاربوا أولياء الرحمن، قال الله: (إن الذين يكفرون بآيات الله ويقتلون النبيين بغير حق ويقتلون الذين يأمرون بالقسط من الناس فبشرهم بعذاب أليم).</p>
<p>O Muawiya, the Prophet<sup>-as</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Zakariya was sawn by a chainsaw, and Yahya<sup>-as</sup> was slaughtered, and his<sup>-as</sup> people killed him<sup>-as</sup>, and he<sup>-as</sup> was calling them to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic, and that is how disgraceful the world is to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. The friends of Satan<sup>-la</sup> have always been at war with the friends of the Beneficent<sup>-azwj</sup>. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Says <strong><em>“[3:21] Surely (as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah and slay the prophets unjustly and slay those among men who enjoin justice, announce to them a painful chastisement”</em></strong>.</p>
<p>يا معاوية، إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قد أخبرني أن أمته سيخضبون لحيتي من دم رأسي، وإني مستشهد، وستلي الأمة من بعدي، وأنك ستقتل ابني الحسن غدرا بالسم، وأن ابنك يزيد لعنه الله سيقتل ابني الحسين، يلي ذلك منه ابن الزانية.</p>
<p>O Muawiya, the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has informed me<sup>-asws</sup> that his<sup>-asws</sup> community will dye my<sup>-asws</sup> beard with the blood from my<sup>-asws</sup> head, and I<sup>-asws</sup> will be martyred, and after me<sup>-asws</sup> the community will follow you, and you will kill my<sup>-asws</sup> son Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> treacherously by posion, and that your son Yazeed, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Curse him, will kill my<sup>-asws</sup> son<sup>-asws</sup> Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, that (deed) will be carried out by the son of a whore.</p>
<p><strong><u>إخباره عليه السلام عن تسلط بني أمية على الأمة </u></strong></p>

<p><strong><u>إخبار أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام عن ظهور الإمام المهدي عليه السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>وأن رجلا من ولدك مشوم ملعون جلف جاف منكوس القلب فظ غليظ قد نزع الله من قلبه الرأفة والرحمة، أخواله من كلب، كأني أنظر إليه ولو شئت لسميته ووصفته وابن كم هو. فيبعث جيشا إلى المدينة فيدخلونها فيسرفون فيها في القتل والفواحش، ويهرب منه رجل من ولدي زكي نقي، الذي يملأ الأرض عدلا وقسطا كما ملئت ظلما وجورا. وإني لأعرف اسمه وابن كم هو يومئذ وعلامته. وهو من ولد ابني الحسين الذي يقتله ابنك يزيد، وهو الثائر بدم أبيه.</p>
<h2 id="news-from-amir-ul-momineen-asws-about-the-appearance-of-the-imam-al-mahdi-asws" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337465482"></a><a name="_Toc341095571"></a>News from Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> about the appearance of the Imam Al-Mahdi<sup>-asws</sup></h2>
<p>And that a man from your sons, and evil, accursed, rude, unpleasant, deficient of the heart, vulgar, harsh, and from whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Removed leniency and mercy, whose maternal uncles will be from dogs, it is as if I<sup>-asws</sup> can see him and had I<sup>-asws</sup> so wished, I<sup>-asws</sup> would have named him, and described him, and how old he will be, so he will send an army to Al-Medina.</p>
<p>So they will enter it, and there will be looting and destruction in it, including the reckless killings (of innocents) and stripping the honours of women. (After this) A man from my<sup>-asws</sup> sons<sup>-asws</sup>, pure and holy, who will fill the earth with justice and equity just as it was filled with injustice and inequity, they will flee from him. And I<sup>-asws</sup> know his<sup>-asws</sup> name, and how old he<sup>-asws</sup> will be on that day, and his<sup>-asws</sup> signs. And he<sup>-asws</sup> will be from the sons<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-asws</sup> son<sup>-asws</sup> Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> who will be killed by your son Yazeed, and he<sup>-asws</sup> will avenge the blood of his<sup>-asws</sup> father<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>فيهرب إلى مكة ويقتل صاحب ذلك الجيش رجلا من ولدي زكيا بريا عند أحجار الزيت. ثم يسير ذلك الجيش إلى مكة، وإني لأعلم اسم أميرهم وعدتهم وأسمائهم وسمات خيولهم، فإذا دخلوا البيداء واستوت بهم الأرض خسف الله بهم. قال الله عز وجل: (ولو ترى إذ فزعوا فلا فوت وأخذوا من مكان قريب)</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> will go to Mecca, and the commander of the army (opposing him<sup>-asws</sup>) will kill a pure man from my<sup>-asws</sup> sons at a place with stones of oil (Ahjaar AL-Zayt). Then that army will travel to Mecca, and I<sup>-asws</sup> know the name of its Emir (leader), and their number, and their names, and the description of their horses. So when they enter Al-Bayda, the earth will spread out and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Make it to swallow them up. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Said <strong><em>“[34:51] And could you see when they shall become terrified, but (then) there shall be no escape and they shall be seized upon from a near place”</em></strong>.</p>
<p>– قال: من تحت أقدامكم – فلا يبقى من ذلك الجيش أحد غير رجل واحد يقلب الله وجهه من قبل قفاه.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘(The ground will shift) from underneath their feet – so there will not remain from that army anyone apart from one man, whose face will have been turned from the scruff of his neck.</p>
<p>ويبعث الله للمهدي أقواما يجتمعون من أطراف الأرض قزع كقزع الخريف. والله إني لأعرف أسمائهم واسم أميرهم ومناخ ركابهم. فيدخل المهدي الكعبة ويبكي ويتضرع، قال الله عز وجل: (أمن يجيب المضطر إذا دعاه ويكشف السوء ويجعلكم خلفاء الأرض) هذا لنا خاصة أهل البيت.</p>
<p>And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Send for Al-Mahdi<sup>-asws</sup> a people. He<sup>-azwj</sup> will Gather them from the corners of the earth like the gathering of the clouds in autumn. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> know their names, and the name of their Emir (leader), and where their rides will stop. So Al-Mahdi<sup>-asws</sup> will enter the Kaabah, and he<sup>-asws</sup> will be crying and Praying. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Said : <strong><em>‘Amma Ya Jeebo isterra Izajaa</em></strong>&nbsp; <strong><em>“[27:62] Or, Who answers the distressed one when he calls upon Him and removes the evil, and He will make you successors in the earth.”</em></strong> This is exclusively for us<sup>-asws</sup>, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household. <em>(This Verse is frequently used for asking for health and recovering from hardships by Muslims)</em></p>

<p>أبان عن سليم وعمر بن أبي سلمة – حديثهما واحد، هذا وذلك – قالا: قدم معاوية حاجا في خلافته المدينة بعد ما قتل أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام وصالح الحسن عليه السلام.</p>
<p><strong>1 –</strong> Abaan from Sulaym and Umar Bin Abu Salma – both have narrated the same (Haidth), this as well as the other – said, ‘Muwaiya (ibn abu Sufyan) went to Al-Medina for Pilgrimage during his Caliphate, after the martyrdom of Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, and the treaty with Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>فاستقبله أهل المدينة، فنظر فإذا الذي استقبله من قريش أكثر من الأنصار. فسأل عن ذلك، فقيل له: (إنهم محتاجون ليست لهم دواب) فالتفت معاوية إلى قيس بن سعد بن عبادة فقال: يا معشر الأنصار، ما لكم لا تستقبلوني مع إخوانكم من قريش؟ فقال قيس – وكان سيد الأنصار وابن سيدهم -: أقعدنا – يا أمير المؤمنين – أن لم تكن لنا دواب فقال معاوية: فأين النواضح؟ فقال قيس: أفنيناها يوم بدر ويوم أحد وما بعدهما في مشاهد رسول الله حين ضربناك وأباك على الإسلام حتى ظهر أمر الله وأنتم كارهون. قال معاوية: اللهم غفرا. قال قيس: أما إن رسول الله قال: (إنكم سترون بعدي إثرة). فقال معاوية: فما أمركم؟ قال: أمرنا أن نصبر حتى نلقاه. فقال: فاصبروا حتى تلقوه</p>
<p>The people of Al-Medina welcomed him (outside of Al-Medina). He looked around at the ones welcoming him and saw that most of them were from the Qureish and none from the ‘Ansar’ (the Helpers). So he asked about that. It was said to him that they are poor, for they do not have livestock (to ride and travel). So Muawiya (after entering into Al-Medina) turned to Qays Bin Sa’d Bin Abada and said, ‘O group of Helpers, what is it with you that you do not welcome me along with your brothers from the Qureish?’</p>
<p>Qays said – and he was the Chief of the Helpers and a son of their Chief: ‘We are sitting (no animals to ride on), O Commander of the Faithful – we do not have livestock’. Muawiya said, ‘Where are the water carriers (camels)?’ Qays said, ‘They were killed on the Day of Badr and the Day of Ohad, and after these two (battles) in the presence of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> when we struck you and your father for the sake of Islam until the Command of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> was Manifested, and you were unwillingly (embraced Islam)’.</p>
<p>Muawiya said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will Forgive you’. Qays said, ‘But, the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘After me<sup>-saww</sup>, you all will see it’s effects’. Muawiya said, ‘So what did he<sup>-saww</sup> order you to do?’ He said, ‘He<sup>-saww</sup> ordered us that we should be patient until we meet him<sup>ajfj</sup>’. He (Muawiya) said, ‘So be patient until you see him<sup>ajfj</sup>’.</p>
<p>ثم قال قيس: يا معاوية، تعيرنا بنواضحنا؟ والله لقد لقيناكم عليها يوم بدر وأنتم جاهدون على إطفاء نور الله وأن تكون كلمة الشيطان هي العليا. ثم دخلت أنت وأبوك كرها في الإسلام الذي ضربناكم عليه. فقال له معاوية: كأنك تمن علينا بنصرتك إيانا، والله لقريش بذلك المن والطول. ألستم تمنون علينا – يا معشر الأنصار – بنصرتكم رسول الله وهو من قريش وهو ابن عمنا ومنا؟ فلنا المن والطول إذ جعلكم الله أنصارنا وأتباعنا فهداكم بنا.</p>
<p>Then Qays said, ‘O Muawiya, you are taunting us about our water carriers?’ By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, we met (confronted) you (riding) upon those on the Day of Badr and you were fighting to extinguish the ‘Al-Noor’ (Light) of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> in order to make the words of Satan<sup>-la</sup> to have supremacy. Then you and your father entered unwillingly into Islam which you were fighting against’.</p>
<p>Muawiya said to him, ‘If you are placing us under obligation for your help to us, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> the credit for that goes to the Qureish. O group of Helpers, are you not placing the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> under obligation by your helping him<sup>-saww</sup>, and he<sup>-saww</sup> was from the Qureish, and he<sup>-saww</sup> was the son<sup>-saww</sup> of our uncle and from us? So the credit goes to us when Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent Help to us, and you followed us and attained guidance through us’.</p>
<p><strong><u>سوابق أبي طالب عليه السلام في نصرة الإسلام </u></strong></p>
<p>فقال قيس: إن الله عز وجل بعث محمدا رحمة للعالمين، فبعثه إلى الناس كافة، إلى الجن والأنس والأحمر والأسود والأبيض، واختاره لنبوته واختصه برسالته.</p>
<h2 id="precedent-of-abu-talib-asws-in-helping-al-islam" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337474529"></a><a name="_Toc341095576"></a>Precedent of Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> in helping Al-Islam</h2>
<p>Qays said, ‘Surely Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Sent Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> as a Mercy to the Worlds. So He<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent him<sup>-saww</sup> to the people for all the beings, to the Jinn, and the humans, and the red, and the black, and the white, and Chose him<sup>-saww</sup> for Prophet-hood, and Honoured him<sup>-saww</sup> by His<sup>-azwj</sup> Message.</p>
<p>فكان أول من صدقه وآمن به ابن عمه علي بن أبي طالب وكان أبو طالب عمه يذب عنه ويمنع منه ويحول بين كفار قريش وبينه أن يروعوه أو يؤذوه ويأمره بتبليغ رسالات ربه.</p>
<p>So the first one to ratify him<sup>-saww</sup>, and believe in him<sup>-saww</sup> was the son<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-saww</sup> uncle<sup>-asws</sup> Ali<sup>-asws</sup> bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and his<sup>-saww</sup> uncle Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> used to defend him<sup>-saww</sup> and prevent (the enemies) from him<sup>-saww</sup> and he<sup>-asws</sup> was a shield between the infidels of Qureish and him<sup>-saww</sup>, so that they do not frightened him<sup>-saww</sup> or hurt him<sup>-saww</sup>, and ordered him<sup>-saww</sup> to preach the Message of his<sup>-saww</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>فلم يزل ممنوعا من الضيم والأذى حتى مات عمه أبو طالب وأمر ابنه عليا بموازرته ونصرته فوازره علي ونصره وجعل نفسه دونه في كل شديدة وكل ضيق وكل خوف، واختص الله بذلك عليا من بين قريش وأكرمه من بين جميع العرب والعجم.</p>
<p>So the grievances and harm did not cease to be barred from him<sup>-saww</sup> until his<sup>-saww</sup> uncle Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> passed away, and he<sup>-asws</sup> ordered his<sup>-asws</sup> son<sup>-asws</sup> Ali<sup>-asws</sup> to support him<sup>-saww</sup> and help him<sup>-saww</sup>. So Ali<sup>-asws</sup> supported him<sup>-saww</sup> and helped him<sup>-saww</sup>, and made his<sup>-asws</sup> own self to be sacrificed in every extremity, and every difficulty, and every fear, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Chose Ali<sup>-asws</sup> due to that from between the Qureish, and Honoured him<sup>-asws</sup> from between all the Arabs and the non-Arabs.</p>
<p>فجمع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله جميع بني عبد المطلب فيهم أبو طالب وأبو لهب، وهم يومئذ أربعون رجلا فدعاهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وخادمه يومئذ علي عليه السلام، ورسول الله يومئذ في حجر عمه أبي طالب،</p>
<p>So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> gathered the sons of Abdul Muttalib<sup>-as</sup>. Among them were Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> and Abu Lahab<sup>-la</sup>, and on that day they were forty men. So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> invited them, and on that day Ali<sup>-asws</sup> attended to them, and on that day the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was in the chamber of his<sup>-saww</sup> uncle<sup>-as</sup> Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>فقال: (أيكم ينتدب أن يكون أخي ووزيري ووارثي وخليفتي في أمتي وولي كل مؤمن بعدي)؟ فسكت القوم حتى أعادها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ثلاث مرات. فقال علي عليه السلام: (أنا يا رسول الله، صلى الله عليك). فوضع رسول الله رأس علي في حجره وتفل في فيه وقال: (اللهم املأ جوفه علما وفهما وحكما).</p>
<p>He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Which one of you would like to be assigned to be my<sup>-saww</sup> brother, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Vizier, and my<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, and my<sup>-saww</sup> Caliph in my<sup>-saww</sup> community, and the Guardian of every ‘Momin’ (believer) after me<sup>-saww</sup>?’ The people were silent, to the extent that the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> made the call three times. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup>, O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Bless you<sup>-saww</sup>’. So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> placed his<sup>-asws</sup> head onto his<sup>-saww</sup> chest (out of kindness), and applied his<sup>-saww</sup> saliva to his<sup>-asws</sup> (forehead) and said: ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Fill his<sup>-asws</sup> heart with Knowledge, and understanding, and Wisdom’.</p>
<p>ثم قال لأبي طالب: (يا أبا طالب، اسمع الآن لابنك علي وأطع، فقد جعله الله من نبيه بمنزلة هارون من موسى). وآخى بين الناس وآخى بين علي وبين نفسه.</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-saww</sup> said to Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>: ‘O Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, from now on listen to your<sup>-asws</sup> son<sup>-asws</sup> Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and obey him<sup>-asws</sup>, for Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Made him<sup>-asws</sup>, from His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> to be of the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>-as</sup>. And he<sup>-saww</sup> established brotherhood between the people, and established brotherhood between Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and himself<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p>فلم يدع قيس بن سعد شيئا من مناقبه إلا ذكرها واحتج بها وقال: منهم أهل البيت جعفر بن أبي طالب الطيار في الجنة بجناحين، اختصه الله بذلك من بين الناس، ومنهم حمزة سيد الشهداء، ومنهم فاطمة سيدة نساء العالمين. فإذا وضعت من قريش رسول الله وأهل بيته وعترته الطيبين، فنحن والله خير منكم – يا معشر قريش – وأحب إلى الله ورسوله وإلى أهل بيته منكم.</p>
<p>Qays did not leave out anything from his<sup>-asws</sup> merits except that he mentioned it and argued by it, and said, ‘Among the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household is Ja’far<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, the flyer in the Paradise by two wings. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Specialised him<sup>-as</sup> by that from between the people. And among them is Hamza<sup>-as</sup>, chief of the martyrs, and among them is Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> Chieftess of the women of the Worlds. So there is a difference between the Qureish, and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-saww</sup> Household, and his<sup>-saww</sup> Family, the goodly ones.</p>
<p>By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, we are better than you are – O community of Qureish – and more beloved to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>, and to the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household than you are.</p>
<p>لقد قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فاجتمعت الأنصار إلى والدي سعد ثم قالوا: (لا نبايع غير سعد). فجاءت قريش بحجة علي وأهل بيته وخاصمونا بحقه وقرابته من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فما يعدو قريش أن يكونوا ظلموا الأنصار أو ظلموا آل محمد عليهم السلام. ولعمري ما لأحد من الأنصار ولا لقريش ولا لأحد من العرب والعجم في الخلافة حق ولا نصيب مع علي بن أبي طالب وولده من بعده.</p>
<p>When the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away, the Helpers gathered around my father Sa’ad, then said, ‘We will not pay allegiance to anyone other than Sa’ad’. So the Qureish came by the argument of being from people close to his<sup>-saww</sup> Household, and disputed with us through this right, and through close relationship to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>The Qureish are nothing more than oppressors to the Helpers or oppressors to the Progeny<sup>-asws</sup> of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>. By my life, there is nothing for anyone neither from the Helpers, nor for the Qureish, nor for any one from the Arabs and the non-Arabs in the Caliphate, any share or right is only for Ali Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> and his<sup>-asws</sup> sons<sup>-asws</sup> from after him<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p>فغضب معاوية وقال: يا بن سعد، عمن أخذت هذا وعمن رويته وعمن سمعته؟ أبوك أخبرك بذلك وعنه أخذته؟ فقال قيس: سمعته وأخذته ممن هو خير من أبي وأعظم علي حقا من أبي. قال: ومن هو؟ قال: ذاك أمير المؤمنين علي بن أبي طالب، عالم هذه الأمة وديانها <u>وصديقها وفاروقها</u> الذي أنزل الله فيه ما أنزل وهو قوله عز وجل: (قل كفى بالله شهيدا بيني وبينكم ومن عنده علم الكتاب). فلم يدع قيس آية نزلت في علي عليه السلام إلا ذكرها.</p>
<p>Muawiya got angry and said, ‘O Ibne Sa’ad, from whom have you taken this, and from whom are you narrating it, and from whom have you heard it? Your father informed you of that and it is from him that you have taken it?’ Qays said, ‘I heard it and took it from the one who is better than my father, and has a greater right over me than my father’. He said, ‘And who is that?’ He said, ‘That is Amir-ul-Momineen Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, the most knowledgeable one of this community, and it’s religious one, and it’s ‘Al-Seddiq’ (Truthful one), and its ‘Al-Farouq’ (Differentiator) regarding whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Revealed what He<sup>-azwj</sup> Revealed, and it is the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic <strong><em>“[13:43] Say: Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you and whoever has knowledge of the Book.”</em></strong> Qays did not leave out a verse which had Come down regarding Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, except that he mentioned it.</p>
<p>فقال معاوية: فإن صديقها أبو بكر وفاروقها عمر، والذي عنده علم الكتاب عبد الله بن سلام قال قيس: أحق بهذه الأسماء وأولى بها الذي أنزل الله فيه: (أفمن كان على بينة من ربه ويتلوه شاهد منه)، والذي أنزل الله جل اسمه فيه: (إنما أنت منذر ولكل قوم هاد)، والله لقد نزلت: (وعلي لكل قوم هاد)، فأسقطتم ذلك، والذي نصبه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بغدير خم فقال: (من كنت أولى به من نفسه فعلي أولى به من نفسه)، وقال له رسول الله في غزوة تبوك: (أنت مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى إلا أنه لا نبي بعدي).</p>
<p>Muawiya said, ‘It’s ‘Al-Seddiq’ (truthful) one is Abu Bakr, and its Differentiator (Farouq) is Umar, and the one with whom is the knowledge of the whole of the Book, he is Abdullah Bin Salaam’.</p>
<p>Qays said, ‘The one deserving of these names (titles) and the one who is the first for it is the one<sup>-asws</sup> for whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Revealed <strong><em>“[11:17] Is he (to be counted equal with them) who relies on a clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it,”</em></strong>, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Majestic is His<sup>-azwj</sup> Name Revealed regarding him <strong><em>“[13:7] You are only a warner and (there is) a guide for every people”</em></strong>. <u>And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Revealed <strong><em>“[13:7] and Ali <sup>-asws</sup> is a guide for every people”</em></strong>, so you dropped that (from the compilation of the Holy Quran, Ali</u><sup>-asws</sup><u>‘s name)</u>.</p>
<p>And the one whom the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> nominated at Ghadeer Khumm saying: ‘The one to whom I<sup>-saww</sup> was higher to than his own self, so Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is higher to him than his own self’, and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said to him<sup>-asws</sup> during the (military) expedition of Tabuk: ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> are from me<sup>-saww</sup> of the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>-as</sup> except that there is no Prophet<sup>-as</sup> after me<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 2 * بداية خطة معاوية في لعن علي عليه السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>وكان معاوية يومئذ بالمدينة، فعند ذلك نادى مناديه وكتب بذلك نسخة إلى جميع البلدان إلى عماله: (ألا برئت الذمة ممن روى حديثا في مناقب علي بن أبي طالب أو فضائل أهل بيته وقد أحل بنفسه العقوبة). وقامت الخطباء في كل كورة ومكان وعلى كل المنابر بلعن علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام والبراءة منه والوقيعة فيه وفي أهل بيته عليهم السلام بما ليس فيهم، واللعنة لهم.</p>

<p>And in those days Muawiya was in Al-Medina. So he called upon a caller to proclaim, and that was written and copied to all the cities to his office bearers, ‘I am not responsible for the one who reports ahadith regarding the merits of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, or the ‘Fazail’ preferences of the Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup> (People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-asws</sup> Household), for he would have brought down the punishment upon himself’. And the preachers in every town and place, and upon every Pulpit stood up to curse Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and distanced themselves from him<sup>-asws</sup>, and narrated (derogatory) stories about him<sup>-asws</sup> and the Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup> which was not regarding them<sup>-asws</sup>, and cursed them<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 3 * احتجاجات ابن عباس على معاوية </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم إن معاوية مر بحلقة من قريش، فلما رأوه قاموا له غير عبد الله بن عباس. فقال له: يا بن عباس، ما منعك من القيام كما قام أصحابك إلا موجدة في نفسك علي بقتالي إياكم يوم صفين. يا بن عباس، إن ابن عمي أمير المؤمنين عثمان قتل مظلوما. قال له ابن عباس: فعمر بن الخطاب قد قتل مظلوما، أفسلمتم الأمر إلى ولده، وهذا ابنه؟ قال: إن عمر قتله مشرك. قال ابن عباس: فمن قتل عثمان؟ قال: قتله المسلمون قال: فذلك أدحض لحجتك وأحل لدمه إن كان المسلمون قتلوه وخذلوه فليس إلا بحق.</p>

<p>Then Muawiya passed by a group of Qureish. When they saw him they stood up apart from Abdullah Bin Abbas. So he said to him, ‘O Ibn Abbas, what prevented you from standing like your companions did, except for the effects in yourself against me due to my fighting against you on the Day of Siffeen? O Ibn Abbas, the son of my uncle-the commander of the faithful Usman was killed unjustly’.</p>
<p>Ibn Abbas said to him, ‘Umar Bin Al-Khattab was (also) killed unjustly, so we should submit the affair to his son, and this (here) is his son?’ He said, ‘Umar was killed by a ‘Mushrik’ Polytheist’. Ibn Abbas said, ‘So who killed Usman?’ He said, ‘The Muslims killed him’. He said, ‘Then it refutes your argument, if Muslims killed him, then his blood was permissible (to be shed), and abandoned him. It was not except by the truth’.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p>قال معاوية: فإنا قد كتبنا في الآفاق ننهى عن ذكر مناقب علي وأهل بيته، فكف لسانك – يا بن عباس – واربع على نفسك. فقال له ابن عباس: أفتنهانا عن قراءة القرآن؟ قال: لا. قال: أفتنهانا عن تأويله؟ قال: نعم. قال: فنقرأه ولا نسأل عما عنى الله به؟ قال: نعم. قال: فأيما أوجب علينا، قرائته أو العمل به؟ قال معاوية: العمل به. قال: فكيف نعمل به حتى نعلم ما عنى الله بما أنزل علينا؟ قال: سل عن ذلك من يتأوله على غير ما تتأوله أنت وأهل بيتك. قال: إنما أنزل القرآن على أهل بيتي فأسأل عنه آل أبي سفيان أو أسأل عنه آل أبي معيط أو اليهود والنصارى والمجوس؟</p>
<p>Muawiya said, ‘We have written to the far horizons prohibiting the mentioning of the merits of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and the Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup>, so restrain your tongue – O Ibn Abbas – and do yourself a favour’. Ibn Abbas said to him, ‘So are you prohibiting us from reciting the Quran?’</p>
<p>He (Muawiya) said, ‘No’.</p>
<p>He (Ibn Abbas) said, ‘So are you preventing us from its meanings?’</p>
<p>He (Muawiya) said, ‘Yes’.</p>
<p>He (Ibn Abbas) said, ‘So we should recite it and not ask what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Meant by it?’</p>
<p>He (Muawiya) said, ‘Yes’.</p>
<p>He (Ibn Abbas) said, ‘So what is more obligatory upon us, it’s recitation or to act by it?’</p>
<p>Muawiya said, ‘The acting in accordance with it’.</p>
<p>He (Ibn Abbas) said, ‘So how can we act by it until we know what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Meant by what He<sup>-azwj</sup> Sent down to us?’</p>
<p>He (Muawiya) said, ‘Ask the one who will explain it differently to what you and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of your household explain it’.</p>
<p>He (Ibn Abbas) said, ‘But, the Quran Descended upon the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my Household, and I should ask about it from the progeny of Abu Sufyan, or ask about it from the progeny of Ma’eet, or the Jews and the Christians and the Magians?’</p>
<p>قال له معاوية: فقد عدلتنا بهم وصيرتنا منهم. قال له ابن عباس: لعمري ما أعدلك بهم، غير أنك نهيتنا أن نعبد الله بالقرآن وبما فيه من أمر ونهي أو حلال أو حرام أو ناسخ أو منسوخ أو عام أو خاص أو محكم أو متشابه، وإن لم تسأل الأمة عن ذلك هلكوا واختلفوا وتاهوا. قال معاوية: فاقرؤا القرآن وتأولوه ولا ترووا شيئا مما أنزل الله فيكم من تفسيره وما قاله رسول الله فيكم، وارووا ما سوى ذلك. قال ابن عباس: قال الله في القرآن: (يريدون أن يطفؤوا نور الله بأفواههم ويأبى الله إلا أن يتم نوره ولو كره الكافرون).</p>
<p>Muawiya said to him, ‘You have equated us with them and included us to be among them’.</p>
<p>Ibn Abbas said to him, ‘By my life, I have not equated you with them, apart from the fact that you are prohibiting us that we should worship Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> by the Quran and by what is in it from the Orders, and Preventions, or Permissibles, or Prohibitions, or Abrogation, or Abrogated, or General, or Special, or Decisive, or Allegorical, and if the community does not ask about that it will perish and differ and follow desires.</p>
<p>Muawiya said, ‘So recite the Quran and its explanation, and do not narrate anything from what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Revealed about you all, from its interpretation, and what the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has said regarding you all, and narrate whatsoever except for that’, Ibn Abbas said, ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has said in the Quran <strong><em>“[9:32] They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths, and Allah will not consent save to perfect His light, though the unbelievers are averse.”</em></strong></p>
<p>قال معاوية: يا بن عباس، اكفني نفسك وكف عني لسانك، وإن كنت لا بد فاعلا فليكن ذلك سرا ولا يسمعه أحد منك علانية. ثم رجع إلى منزله، فبعث إليه بخمسين ألف درهم.</p>
<p>Mauwiya said, ‘O Ibn Abbas, restrain yourself and restrain your tongue from me, and if you cannot do that then do that secretly, and do not let anyone hear it from you in the open’. Then he (Muawiya) returned to his house and sent over to him fifty thousand Dirhams.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 4 * اشتداد البلاء على الشيعة في عهد معاوية </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم اشتد البلاء بالأمصار كلها على شيعة علي وأهل بيته عليهم السلام، وكان أشد الناس بلية أهل الكوفة لكثرة من بها من الشيعة. واستعمل عليهم زيادا أخاه وضم إليه البصرة والكوفة وجميع العراقين. وكان يتتبع الشيعة وهو بهم عالم لأنه كان منهم فقد عرفهم وسمع كلامهم أول شيء. فقتلهم تحت كل كوكب وحجر ومدر، وأجلاهم وأخافهم وقطع الأيدي والأرجل منهم وصلبهم على جذوع النخل وسمل أعينهم وطردهم وشردهم حتى انتزعوا عن العراق. فلم يبق بالعراقين أحد مشهور إلا مقتول أو مصلوب أو طريد أو هارب.</p>
<h2 id="4-intensification-of-the-affliction-upon-the-shiites-during-the-era-of-muawiya" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337474532"></a><a name="_Toc341095579"></a>4 – Intensification of the affliction upon the Shiites during the era of Muawiya</h2>
<p>Then the afflictions intensified upon the Shiites of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and the Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup> in every city, and the most extreme affliction was upon the inhabitants of Al-Kufa, for the most of them were from Shiites. And Ziyad, his (Muawiya’s illigitimate) brother was the governor upon them, and he had the responsibility of Al-Basra, and Al-Kufa, and all the Iraqis. And he followed the Shiites (before being solomonised as being his brother), and he knew them because he used to be one of them before. So he recognised them and had heard their speech from the very first. So he killed them under every star, and stone and pebble, and limited them, and frightened them, and cut off their hands and their feet from them, and crucified them upon the trunk of the palm trees, and poked their eyes, and expelled them and displaced them until they were all grabbed from Al-Iraq.</p>
<p>There did not remain anyone well-known from among the Iraqis except that he was either killed or crucified, or expelled, or he fled.</p>
<p>وكتب معاوية إلى قضاته وولاته في جميع الأرضين والأمصار: (أن لا تجيزوا لأحد من شيعة علي بن أبي طالب ولا من أهل بيته ولا من أهل ولايته الذين يرون فضله ويتحدثون بمناقبه شهادة).</p>
<p>And Muawiya wrote to his judges, and his governors in all of the lands and the cities that, ‘It is not permitted for anyone who narrates any merits of the Shiites of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, or any from the Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup>, or of his<sup>-asws</sup> friends, to be accepted as a witness’.</p>
<p><strong><u>تقريب معاوية جماعة عثمان واختلاق المناقب له </u></strong></p>
<p>وكتب إلى عماله: (انظروا من قبلكم من شيعة عثمان ومحبيه وأهل بيته وأهل ولايته والذين يرون فضله ويتحدثون بمناقبه، فأدنوا مجالسهم وأكرموهم وقربوهم وشرفوهم، واكتبوا إلي بكل ما يروي كل رجل منهم فيه واسم الرجل واسم أبيه وممن هو).</p>
<h2 id="focus-of-muawiya-on-usmans-group-and-fabrication-of-the-virtues-for-him" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337474533"></a><a name="_Toc341095580"></a>Focus of Muawiya on Usman’s group and fabrication of the virtues for him</h2>
<p>And he wrote to his office bearers, ‘Look at the ones in front of you from the Shiites (adherents) of Usman and those that love him, and the people of his household, and his friends, and the one who are reporting his virtues and narrating his merits, so encourage their gatherings and bring them closer, and honour them, and consider them to be near to you and give them prestige, and write to me about everyone of them, each one of them with his name and the name of his father, and from (which family) he comes’.</p>
<p>ففعلوا ذلك حتى أكثروا في عثمان الحديث وبعث إليهم بالصلات والكسي وأكثر لهم القطائع من العرب والموالي. فكثروا في كل مصر وتنافسوا في المنازل والضياع واتسعت عليهم الدنيا. فلم يكن أحد يأتي عامل مصر من الأمصار ولا قرية فيروي في عثمان منقبة أو يذكر له فضيلة إلا كتب اسمه وقرب وشفع. فلبثوا بذلك ما شاء الله.</p>
<p>So they did that to the extent that the Hadith of Usman became numerous, and he sent to them (the narrators) gifts, and garments, and gave them plenty of land, regardless to them being Arabs or non-Arabs. Soon there were too many of them in every city, and they constructed (big) houses, and the world became luxurious for them. There was no city worker who came from the cities, or a town who reported merits regarding Usman, or mentioned preferences for him except that his name was noted, and he was considered as a near one and was recommended. So it remained like that for as long as Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Desired it to.</p>
<p><strong><u>سعي معاوية في إحياء اسم أبي بكر وعمر</u></strong></p>
<p>ثم كتب بعد ذلك إلى عماله: (أن الحديث قد كثر في عثمان وفشا في كل قرية ومصر ومن كل ناحية، فإذا جاءكم كتابي هذا فادعوا الناس إلى الرواية في أبي بكر وعمر، فإن فضلهما وسوابقهما أحب إلي وأقر لعيني وأدحض لحجة أهل هذا البيت وأشد عليهم من مناقب عثمان وفضائله). فقرأ كل قاض وأمير من ولاته كتابه على الناس، وأخذ الناس في الروايات في أبي بكر وعمر وفي مناقبهم.</p>
<h2 id="the-quest-of-muawiya-to-revive-the-names-of-abu-bakr-and-umar" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337474534"></a><a name="_Toc341095581"></a>The quest of Muawiya to revive the names of Abu Bakr and Umar</h2>
<p>Then, after that, he wrote to his office bearers that, ‘The narrations (Ahadith) regarding Usman have become plentiful, and have been spread in every town and city and from every area, so when this letter of mine gets to you, call the people to the reporting with regards to Abu Bakr and Umar, for their virtues, and their precedence is beloved to me, and refreshing to my eyes and refutes the arguments of the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the House, and is harsher to them<sup>-asws</sup> than the merits of Usman and his virtues’. Every judge and Emir (leader) appointed by him read his letter out to the people, and the people took to the reporting with regards to Abu Bakr and Umar and their merits.</p>
<p><strong><u>أمر معاوية بتعليم المناقب الكاذبة للأطفال والنساء </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم كتب نسخة جمع فيها جميع ما روي فيهم من المناقب والفضائل، وأنفذها إلى عماله وأمرهم بقرائتها على المنابر وفي كل كورة وفي كل مسجد. وأمرهم أن ينفذوا إلى معلمي الكتاتيب أن يعلموها صبيانهم حتى يرووها ويتعلموها كما يتعلمون القرآن وحتى علموها بناتهم ونسائهم وخدمهم وحشمهم. فلبثوا بذلك ما شاء الله.</p>

<p>Then he gathered all these reports regarding them, from their virtues and their merits, in the form of a book, and enforced it upon his office bearers and ordered them to recite these upon the Pulpits and in every town and in every Masjid. And he ordered them to enforce the teachers of the Quran to teach it to their boys until they report it and learn it just as they had learnt the Quran, and until they had taught it to their daughters, and their women, and their older servants, and their younger servants. So it remained like that for as long as Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Desired it to.</p>
<p><strong><u>برنامج معاوية لإبادة الشيعة </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم كتب معاوية إلى عماله نسخة واحدة إلى جميع البلدان: (انظروا من قامت عليه البينة أنه يحب عليا وأهل بيته، فامحوه من الديوان ولا تجيزوا له شهادة). ثم كتب كتابا آخر: (من اتهمتموه ولم تقم عليه بينة أنه منهم فاقتلوه).</p>
<h2 id="the-program-of-muawiya-to-exterminate-the-shiites" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337474536"></a><a name="_Toc341095583"></a>The program of Muawiya to exterminate the Shiites</h2>
<p>Then Muawiya wrote to his office bearers and copied it to all of the countries, ‘Look at the one who establishes the proof whether he loves Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and the Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup> (People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-asws</sup> Household), so remove him from the register and do not permit him to be a witness’. Then he wrote another letter, ‘The one who is accused of it (loving Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup>), and even though there is no clear proof for it even then consider him to be one from them, kill him’.</p>
<p>فقتلوهم على التهم والظن والشبه تحت كل كوكب، حتى لقد كان الرجل يغلط بكلمة فيضرب عنقه. ولم يكن ذلك البلاء في بلد أكبر ولا أشد منه بالعراق ولا سيما بالكوفة، حتى أنه كان الرجل من شيعة علي عليه السلام – وممن بقي من أصحابه بالمدينة وغيرها – ليأتيه من يثق به فيدخل بيته، ثم يلقي إليه سره فيخاف من خادمه ومملوكه، فلا يحدثه حتى يأخذ عليه الأيمان المغلظة ليكتمه عليه.</p>
<p>So they killed them (Shiites) under every star, based upon accusations, and the assumption, and the doubts, to the extent that if there was a man who spoke out of turn, his neck was struck off. This was not the affliction in large cities, or mostly in Iraq, particularly in Al-Kufa, to the extent that if there was a man from the Shiites of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> – from the remaining of his<sup>-asws</sup> companions in Al-Medina and other places – if a reliable person would come to him and enter his house, then he would speak to him in secret, fearing from his servants and his slaves, so he would not narrate to him until he had taken a binding oath from him to keep it secret.</p>
<p>وجعل الأمر لا يزداد إلا شدة وكثر عندهم عدوهم وأظهروا أحاديثهم الكاذبة في أصحابهم من الزور والبهتان، فنشأ الناس على ذلك ولم يتعلموا إلا منهم ومضى على ذلك قضاتهم وولاتهم وفقهائهم.</p>
<p>And the matter did not increase except for its intensity, and most of the ones in his (Muawiya) presence were their<sup>-asws</sup> enemies, and they manifested false Hadith and attributed to them<sup>-asws</sup> and to their companions fabrications and slanderous. So the people grew up on that and did not know except from them, and their judges and their governors and their jurists and died upon that.</p>
<p>وكان أعظم الناس في ذلك بلاء وفتنه القراء المراءون المتصنعون، الذين يظهرون لهم الحزن والخشوع والنسك، ويكذبون ويفتعلون الأحاديث ليحظوا بذلك عند ولاتهم ويدنوا بذلك مجالسهم ويصيبوا بذلك الأموال والقطائع والمنازل.</p>
<p>And the people who were the greatest (accusers) during that affliction and strife were the reciters, and the hypocrites and the fabricators, who displayed their grief, and their reverence, and their ascetism. They used to lie and fabricate Ahadith in order to benefit by that in the presence of their governors, and get closer to them in their gatherings, and acquire by that a share of the wealth, and the pieces of land, and mansions.</p>
<p>حتى صارت أحاديثهم تلك ورواياتهم في أيدي من يحسب أنها حق وأنها صدق، فرووها وقبلوها وتعلموها وعلموها وأحبوا عليها وأبغضوا، حتى جمعت على ذلك مجالسهم وصارت في أيدي الناس المتدينين الذين لا يستحلون الكذب ويبغضون عليه أهله. فقبلوها وهم يرون أنها حق، ولو علموا أنها باطل لم يرووها ولم يتدينوا بها ولا تنقصوا من خالفهم. فصار الحق في ذلك الزمان باطلا والباطل حقا والصدق كذبا والكذب صدقا.</p>
<p>This went on to the extent that their (false) Ahadith and reports ended up in the hands of the ones who concluded that these are right and that these are the truth. So they narrated these, and accepted these, and learnt these, and taught these, and loved and hated on the basis of these, to the extent that they gathered upon these in their gatherings, and these ended up in the hands of the religious people who did not consider it permissible to lie or hatred towards its ‘<em>Ahl</em>’ (Abu Bakr and Umar and Usman).</p>
<p>So they accepted these and they were narrating these as truth, and had they known that these are false, they would not have narrated these nor would they have made these to be their Religion, nor would they have reduced the ones who disagreed with them. In that era the truth became falsehood and the falsehood became the truth, and what was true became the lies and the lies became the true.</p>
<p>وقد قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (لتشملنكم فتنة يربو فيها الوليد وينشأ فيها الكبير، يجري الناس عليها ويتخذونها سنة. فإذا غير منها شيء قالوا: أتى الناس منكرا، غيرت السنة)</p>
<p>And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had said: ‘You will be engulfed by strife during which the young will be nourished by it and the adults will grow old in, and the people will flow towards it and will take (the innovations) as the Sunnah. If anything is altered in it they will say, ‘The people have become deniers and have changed the Sunnah’.</p>
<p>فلما مات الحسن بن علي عليه السلام لم يزل الفتنة والبلاء يعظمان ويشتدان، فلم يبق ولي لله إلا خائفا على دمه أو مقتولا أو طريدا أو شريدا، ولم يبق عدو لله إلا مظهرا حجته غير مستتر ببدعته وضلالته.</p>
<p>When Al-Hassan Bin Ali<sup>-asws</sup> left the world (after being martyred), the strife and the afflictions did not decline, but they got magnified and intensified. There did not remain a friend of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> except that he was in fear for his life or had been killed, or expelled, or became a fugitive, and there did not remain an enemy of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> except that he displayed his arguments without hiding its innovation and misguidance.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 5 * مناشدات واحتجاجات الإمام الحسين عليه السلام بمكة </u></strong></p>

<p>When it was a year before the death of Muawiya, Al-Husayn Bin Ali<sup>-asws</sup> performed the Pilgrimage, and Abdullah Bin Abbas and Abdullah Bin Ja’far were with him<sup>-asws</sup>. Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> gathered the Clan of Hashim, their men, and their women, and their friends, and their Shiites from the Pilgrims who were among them, and from the Helpers who recognised Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> and the Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup>. Then he<sup>-asws</sup> sent a message, ‘Do not leave anyone from the general Pilgrims from the companions of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> who are well known for their righteousness and their ascetism, but gather them for me<sup>-asws</sup>’. So more than seven hundred men gathered for him<sup>-asws</sup> in Mina and they were in his<sup>-asws</sup> tent. Most of them were from the ‘Tabi’een’<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>, and there were approximately two hundred companions of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and others.</p>
<p>فقام فيهم الحسين عليه السلام خطيبا فحمد الله وأثنى عليه، ثم قال: أما بعد، فإن هذا الطاغية قد فعل بنا وبشيعتنا ما قد رأيتم وعلمتم وشهدتم، وإني أريد أن أسألكم عن شيء، فإن صدقت فصدقوني وإن كذبت فكذبوني. أسألكم بحق الله عليكم وحق رسول الله وحق قرابتي من نبيكم، لما سيرتم مقامي هذا ووصفتم مقالتي ودعوتم أجمعين في أنصاركم من قبائلكم من آمنتم من الناس ووثقتم به، فادعوهم إلى ما تعلمون من حقنا، فإني أتخوف أن يدرس هذا الأمر ويذهب الحق ويغلب، والله متم نوره ولو كره الكافرون.</p>
<p>So Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> stood up among them. He<sup>-asws</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, then said: ‘After that, you have seen what this tyrant (Muawiya) has done to us<sup>-asws</sup> and to our<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites, and you know it and have witnessed it, and I<sup>-asws</sup> want to ask you all about something, so if I<sup>-asws</sup> speak the truth, ratify me<sup>-asws</sup>, and if I<sup>-asws</sup> lie, deny me<sup>-asws</sup>. I<sup>-asws</sup> ask you by the Right of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> upon you all, and the right of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and by the right of my<sup>-asws</sup> relationship with your Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, when you travel from this place of mine<sup>-asws</sup>, you should keep it secret and only relate my<sup>-asws</sup> speech and invite all those who are your helpers from your tribes, the ones who are trustworthy and reliable from the people, and call them to what you know from our<sup>-asws</sup> rights, for I<sup>-asws</sup> am afraid that this matter (falsifying and fabrication of the Hadith) will obliterate the truth and will overcome it, <strong><em>“[61:8] and Allah will perfect His light, though the unbelievers may be averse.”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>مناقب أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام على لسان الإمام الحسين عليه السلام </u></strong></p>

<p>And he<sup>-asws</sup> did not leave out anything from what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Revealed regarding them<sup>-asws</sup> from the Quran except that he<sup>-asws</sup> recited it and explained it, nor anything from what the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had said regarding his<sup>-asws</sup> father<sup>-asws</sup>, and his<sup>-asws</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, and his<sup>-asws</sup> mother<sup>-asws</sup>, and regarding himself<sup>-asws</sup> and the Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup>, and for all that the companions said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes! We have heard that and testify to that’. And the Tabi’een said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, it has been narrated to us by the ones who are truthful, and reliable ones from the companions’.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> adjure you all to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, only narrate this to the one whom you trust with it and trust his Religion’.</p>
<p>قال سليم: فكان فيما ناشدهم الحسين عليه السلام وذكرهم أن قال: أنشدكم الله أتعلمون أن علي بن أبي طالب كان أخا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حين آخى بين أصحابه، فآخى بينه وبين نفسه وقال: (أنت أخي وأنا أخوك في الدنيا والآخرة)؟ قالوا: اللهم نعم.</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘From the representations made by Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> and reminding them of was that he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> adjure you to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, do you all know that Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> was established as a brother of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> when he<sup>-saww</sup> established brotherhood between his<sup>-saww</sup> companions, so he<sup>-saww</sup> established brotherhood between him<sup>-asws</sup> and himself<sup>-saww</sup>, and said: ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> are my<sup>-saww</sup> brother and I<sup>-saww</sup> am your<sup>-asws</sup> brother in the world and in the Hereafter?’ They said, ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, yes!’</p>
<p>قال: أنشدكم الله، هل تعلمون أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله اشترى موضع مسجده ومنازله فابتناه، ثم ابتنى فيه عشرة منازل، تسعة له وجعل عاشرها في وسطها لأبي. ثم سد كل باب شارع إلى المسجد غير بابه، فتكلم في ذلك من تكلم، فقال صلى الله عليه وآله: (ما أنا سددت أبوابكم وفتحت بابه، ولكن الله أمرني بسد أبوابكم وفتح بابه).</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> adjure you to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, do you all know that the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> acquired a place for his<sup>-saww</sup> Masjid and his<sup>-saww</sup> house so he<sup>-saww</sup> constructed it, then built within it ten houses, nine for himself<sup>-saww</sup>, and made the tenth one to be for my<sup>-asws</sup> father<sup>-asws</sup>. Then he<sup>-asws</sup> closed all the doors which led to the Masjid apart from his<sup>-asws</sup> door. The ‘one’ who spoke about it spoke. So he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘It was not me<sup>-saww</sup> who closed all your doors and kept his<sup>-asws</sup> door open, but it was Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Who Ordered me<sup>-asws</sup> to close your doors and keep his<sup>-asws</sup> door open’.</p>
<p>ثم نهى الناس أن يناموا في المسجد غيره، وكان يجنب في المسجد ومنزله في منزل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، فولد لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وله فيه أولاد؟ قالوا: اللهم نعم.</p>

<p>قال: أفتعلمون أن عمر بن الخطاب حرص على كوة قدر عينه يدعها من منزله إلى المسجد، فأبى عليه. ثم خطب صلى الله عليه وآله فقال: إن الله أمر موسى أن يبني مسجدا طاهرا لا يسكنه غيره وغير هارون وابنيه وإن الله أمرني أن أبني مسجدا طاهرا لا يسكنه غيري وغير أخي وابنيه؟ قالوا: اللهم نعم.</p>

<p>فلم يدع شيئا أنزله الله في علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام خاصة وفي أهل بيته من القرآن ولا على لسان نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله إلا ناشدهم فيه، فيقول الصحابة: (اللهم نعم، قد سمعنا)، ويقول التابعي: (اللهم قد حدثنيه من أثق به، فلان وفلان).</p>
<p>(Sulaym said), ‘He<sup>-asws</sup> did not leave out anything which had been Revealed regarding Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> especially, and regarding the Ahl Al-Bayt<sup>-asws</sup>, neither from the Quran nor from the tongue of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> except that he<sup>-asws</sup> adjured them to it.

<p>ثم ناشدهم أنهم قد سمعوه صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (من زعم أنه يحبني ويبغض عليا فقد كذب، ليس يحبني وهو يبغض عليا) فقال له قائل: يا رسول الله، وكيف ذلك؟ قال: لأنه مني وأنا منه، من أحبه فقد أحبني ومن أحبني فقد أحب الله، ومن أبغضه فقد أبغضني ومن أبغضني فقد أبغض الله)؟ فقالوا: (اللهم نعم، قد سمعنا).</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> adjured them that they had heard from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying: ‘The one who thinks that he loves me<sup>-saww</sup> and hates Ali<sup>-asws</sup> has in fact lied, for he is not the one who loves me<sup>-saww</sup> but he hates Ali<sup>-asws</sup>’. So someone said to him<sup>-saww</sup>, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and how can that be?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said to him: ‘Because he<sup>-asws</sup> is from me<sup>-saww</sup> and I<sup>-saww</sup> am from him<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>

<p>أبان بن أبي عياش عن سليم، قال: إني كنت عند عبد الله بن عباس في بيته وعنده رهط من الشيعة. قال: فذكروا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وموته، فبكى ابن عباس، وقال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يوم الاثنين – وهو اليوم الذي قبض فيه – وحوله أهل بيته وثلاثون رجلا من أصحابه: ايتوني بكتف أكتب لكم فيه كتابا لن تضلوا بعدي ولن تختلفوا بعدي. فمنعهم فرعون هذه الأمة فقال: (إن رسول الله يهجر) فغضب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وقال: (إني أراكم تخالفوني وأنا حي، فكيف بعد موتي)؟ فترك الكتف.</p>
<p>Abaan Bin Abu Ayyash, from Sulaym who said, ‘I was in the presence of Abdullah Bin Abbas in his house, and with him was a group from the Shiites. He said, ‘He mentioned the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and his<sup>-saww</sup> passing away (martyrdom), so Ibn Abbas wept and said, ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said on the Day of Monday – and it was the day in which he<sup>-saww</sup> passed away –and around him<sup>-asws</sup> were the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-saww</sup> Household and thirty men from his<sup>-saww</sup> companions: ‘Bring to me<sup>-saww</sup> a ‘paper’ so that I<sup>-saww</sup> may write for you all in it, a writing so that you will never go astray after me<sup>-saww</sup> and will never disagree (between yourselves) after me<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p>But the Pharaoh of the community (Umar) prevented it. He said, ‘Surely the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> is out of his<sup>-saww</sup> mind (delirious)’ So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> got angry and said: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> am looking at you opposing me<sup>-saww</sup> whilst I<sup>-saww</sup> am still alive, so how will it be after my<sup>-saww</sup> passing away?’ So he<sup>-saww</sup> left it without’.</p>
<p>قال سليم: ثم أقبل علي ابن عباس فقال: يا سليم، لولا ما قال ذلك الرجل لكتب لنا كتابا لا يضل أحد ولا يختلف. فقال رجل من القوم: ومن ذلك الرجل؟ فقال: ليس إلى ذلك سبيل.</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘Then I addressed Ibn Abbas, so he said, ‘O Sulaym, Had the man not said that, he<sup>aww</sup> would have written for us a writing (as a result of which) no one would have gone astray nor differed’. A man from the group said, ‘And who was that man?’ He said, ‘There is no way to that (naming him)’.</p>
<p>فخلوت بابن عباس بعد ما قام القوم، فقال: هو عمر. فقلت: صدقت، قد سمعت عليا عليه السلام وسلمان وأبا ذر والمقداد يقولون: (إنه عمر). فقال: يا سليم، اكتم إلا ممن تثق بهم من إخوانك، فإن قلوب هذه الأمة أشربت حب هذين الرجلين كما أشربت قلوب بني إسرائيل حب العجل والسامري.</p>
<p>So I was alone with Ibn Abbas after the group had left, so he said, ‘He was Umar’. I said, ‘You have spoke the truth, I have heard Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup> all saying that he was Umar’. He said, ‘Sulaym, conceal it except from the one who is reliable from among your brothers, for the hearts of this community have drunk from the love of these two men (Abu Bakr and Umar) just as the hearts of the Children of Israel had drunk the love of the calf and Al-Samiri’.</p>

<p>قال أبان: سمعت سليم بن قيس يقول: شهدت يوم الجمل عليا عليه السلام، وكنا اثني عشر ألفا وكان أصحاب الجمل زيادة على عشرين ومائة ألف. وكان مع علي عليه السلام من المهاجرين والأنصار نحو من أربعة آلاف ممن شهد مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بدرا والحديبية ومشاهده، وسائر الناس من أهل الكوفة إلا من تبعه من أهل البصرة والحجاز ليست له هجرة ممن أسلم بعد الفتح. وجل الأربعة آلاف من الأنصار.</p>
<p>Abaan said, ‘I heard Sulaym Bin Qays saying, ‘I battled alongside Ali<sup>-asws</sup> on the Day of the Camel (Al-Jamal), and we were twelve thousand men, and the companions of the Camel were more than one hundred and twenty thousand men. And with Ali<sup>-asws</sup> were approximately four thousand from the Emigrants and the Helpers from the ones who had battled alongside with the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> at Badr, and Al-Hudaybiyya, and his<sup>-saww</sup> other battles, and the rest of the men were the inhabitants of Al-Kufa except for the ones who followed him<sup>-asws</sup> from the inhabitants of Al-Basra, and Al-Hijaaz, for whom there was no emigration after having embraced Islam after the victory (of Mecca). Most of those four thousand were from the Helpers.</p>
<p>ولم يكره أحدا من الناس على البيعة ولا على القتال، إنما ندبهم فانتدب من أهل بدر سبعون ومائة رجل، وجلهم من الأنصار ممن شاهد أحدا والحديبية، ولم يتخلف عنه أحد. وليس أحد من المهاجرين والأنصار إلا وهواه معه، يتولونه ويدعون له بالظفر والنصر ويحبون ظهوره على من ناواه، ولم يحرجهم ولم يضيق عليهم وقد بايعوه، وليس كل الناس يقاتل في سبيل الله.</p>
<p>No one from the people had been unwilling in pledging allegiance or unwilling to fight, but rather, they had been called, so one hundred and seventy men from the people of Badr responded, and most of them were from the Helpers from the ones who had battled at Ohad and Al-Hudaybiyya, and no one had opposed him<sup>-asws</sup>. And there was no one from the Emigrants and the Helpers except that he was with him<sup>-asws</sup>, befriending him<sup>-asws</sup> and supplicating for him<sup>-asws</sup> for the winning and the victory, and they loved for him<sup>-asws</sup> to be successful against the ones who were against him. And neither did he<sup>-asws</sup> request them nor did he<sup>-asws</sup> try to convince them, and they had paid the allegiance, and it is not for every human being that he should fight in the Way of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>والطاعن عليه والمتبرء منه قليل مستتر عنه، مظهر له الطاعة غير ثلاثة رهط، بايعوه ثم شكوا في القتال معه وقعدوا في بيوتهم: محمد بن مسلمة وسعد بن أبي وقاص وابن عمر. وأسامة بن زيد سلم بعد ذلك ورضي، ودعا لعلي عليه السلام واستغفر له وبرئ من عدوه وشهد أنه على الحق، ومن خالفه ملعون حلال الدم.</p>
<p>And only a few contested with him<sup>-asws</sup> and kept away from him<sup>-asws</sup> hiding themselves and displaying to him<sup>-asws</sup> the obedience, apart from a group of three. They paid allegiance to him<sup>-asws</sup>, then doubted with regards to fighting alongside him<sup>-asws</sup>, and they sat in their houses – Muhammad Bin Muslama, and Sa’d Bin Abu Waqqas, and Ibn Umar. And Usama Bin Zayd submitted after that and was happy, and supplicated for Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and repented to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and renounced his<sup>-asws</sup> enemies, and testified that he<sup>-asws</sup> was on the truth, and the ones opposed to him<sup>-asws</sup> were accursed and those whose blood is permissible to be shed.</p>

<p>Abaan said, ‘When Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> met the people of Al-Basra (Battle of the Camel), Ali<sup>-asws</sup> called out to Al-Zubayr: ‘O Abu Abdullah, come out to me<sup>-asws</sup>’. So his companions said to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, you<sup>-asws</sup> are going out to Al-Zubayr, the breaker of the allegiance, and he is on the horse and clad in armour, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are upon a mule without weapons?’ Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘A protective shield from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is covering me<sup>-asws</sup>. There is no leeway for anyone to flee from his time (death).

<p>Al-Zubayr said, ‘How can we be the accursed ones whilst we are from the people of the Paradise?’ Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Had I<sup>-asws</sup> known that you are all from the people of the Paradise, would I<sup>-asws</sup> considered it permissible to fight against you?’ Al-Zubayr said, ‘But have you<sup>-asws</sup> not heard the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying on the Day of Ohad: ‘The Paradise has been obligated upon Talha, and the one who intends to look at a live martyr walking upon the earth, he should look at Talha?

Do you see that if I<sup>-asws</sup> intended – after the killing of Usman – to have this matter go into ‘Shura’ (consultation), which people have given to me<sup>-asws</sup> (after pledging alligance to me<sup>-asws</sup>)?’</p>
<p>He said, ‘No’.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘And why not?’</p>
<p>He said, ‘Because your<sup>-asws</sup> ‘Bayat’ (allegiance) was carried out without any opposition’.</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘And how can that be, and the Helpers had their swords drawn and they were saying, ‘If you are free (from the consultation) and have not paid allegiance to one from among you, we will strike all of your necks’.</p>
<p>So did I<sup>-asws</sup> say anything to you and to your companion anything like this when the two of you paid allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup>? And my<sup>-asws</sup> argument in the abhorrence in the allegiance is clearer than your argument, and you and your companion had paid allegiance to me<sup>-asws</sup> willingly, not with abhorrence, and the two of you were the first ones to do that, and no one said that the two of you should pay allegiance or else he will kill both of you’.</p>
<p>فانصرف طلحة ونشب القتال، فقتل طلحة وانهزم الزبير.</p>
<p>So Talha turned and left, and the battle erupted. Talha was killed, and Al-Zubayr was defeated.</p>

<p>Abaan said that Sulaym said, ‘I heard Ibn Abbas say, ‘I hear from Ali<sup>-asws</sup> a Hadith, I don’t know what its perspective is, and did not deny it. I heard him<sup>-asws</sup> say that: ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> confided a secret to me<sup>-asws</sup> during his<sup>-saww</sup> illness.

<p>وإني لجالس بذي قار في فسطاط علي عليه السلام وقد بعث الحسن عليه السلام وعمارا إلى أهل الكوفة يستنفران الناس، إذ أقبل علي علي عليه السلام فقال: يا بن عباس، يقدم عليك الحسن ومعه أحد عشر ألف رجل غير رجل أو رجلين. فقلت في نفسي: إن كان كما قال فهو من تلك الألف باب.</p>
<p>And I was seated at Zeeqar in the Marquee of Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> had sent Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Ammar to the inhabitants of Al-Kufa to mobilise the people. When I was in front of Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, he <sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Ibn Abbas, Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> will come to you, and with him<sup>-asws</sup> will be eleven thousand men apart from one or two men’.

<p>قال أبان: سمعت سليم بن قيس يقول – وسألته: هل شهدت صفين؟ فقال: نعم. قلت: هل شهدت يوم الهرير؟ قال: نعم. قلت: كم كان أتى عليك من السن؟ قال: أربعون سنة. قلت: فحدثني رحمك الله. قال: مهما نسيت من شيئ من الأشياء فلا أنسى هذا الحديث.</p>
<p>Abaan said, ‘I heard Sulaym say – and I asked him, ‘Did you witness Siffeen?’ He said, ‘Yes’. I asked, ‘You witnessed the night of Al-Hareer?’ He replied, ‘Yes’.</p>
<p>I asked, ‘How old were you then?’ He said, ‘Forty years’. I said, ‘So narrate to me, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on you’. He said, ‘Whatever thing I have forgotten from the things, I cannot forget this event’.</p>
<p>ثم بكى وقال: صفوا وصففنا، فخرج مالك الأشتر على فرس له أدهم مجنب وسلاحه معلق على فرسه وبيده الرمح وهو يقرع به رؤوسنا ويقول: (أقيموا صفوفكم). فلما كتب الكتائب وأقام الصفوف أقبل على فرسه حتى قام بين الصفين فولى أهل الشام ظهره وأقبل علينا بوجهه،</p>
<p>Then he wept and said, ‘We were aligned in our rows when Maalik Al-Ashtar came out on his horse which was very tall, and his weapons were attached to his horse, and in his hand was the spear and he was knocking our heads with it and saying, ‘Establish your rows’. When the writer had written and our rows had been established, he came over on his horse until he stood between the two rows, in such a way that his back was towards the people of Syria, and he was turned towards us by his face.</p>
<p>فحمد الله وأثنى عليه وصلى على النبي صلى الله عليه وآله، ثم قال: (أما بعد، فإنه كان من قضاء الله وقدره اجتماعنا في هذه البقعة من الأرض لآجال قد اقتربت وأمور تصرمت، يسوسنا فيها سيد المسلمين وأمير المؤمنين وخير الوصيين وابن عم نبينا وأخوه ووارثه، وسيوفنا سيوف الله، ورئيسهم ابن آكلة الأكباد وكهف النفاق وبقية الأحزاب يسوقهم إلى الشقاء والنار. ونحن نرجو بقتالهم من الله الثواب، وهم ينتظرون العقاب.</p>
<p>So he Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, and sent greetings upon the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, then said, ‘After that, it is from the Judgements of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Power that He<sup>-azwj</sup> has Gathered us in this spot from the earth for the appointed term which has come nearer and the Commands which have been Issued.</p>
<p>We are led in it by the Chief of the Muslims and Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> and the best of the successors<sup>-as</sup>, and the son<sup>-asws</sup> of the uncle<sup>-as</sup> of our Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and his<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, and his<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, and our swords are the swords of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and their leader is the son of the liver-eater (Muawiya son of Hinda) and a shelter for hypocrisy and the rest of the parties, leading them to the misery and the Fire. And we are hopeful that by killing them we will be Rewarded by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> whilst they are awaiting the Punishment.</p>
<p>فإذا حمى الوطيس وثار القتال وجالت الخيل بقتلانا وقتلاهم رجونا بقتالهم النصر من الله، فلا أسمعن إلا غمغمة أو همهمة. أيها الناس، غضوا الأبصار وعضوا على النواجذ من الأضراس فإنها أشد لضرب الرأس، واستقبلوا القوم بوجوهكم وخذوا قوائم سيوفكم بأيمانكم، فاضربوا الهام وأطعنوا بالرماح مما يلي الشرسوف (موتورين بآبائهم وبدماء إخوانهم حنقين على عدوهم، قد وطنوا أنفسهم على الموت، لكيلا تذلوا ولا يلزمكم في الدنيا عار).</p>
<p>So when the contest heats up, and the fighting erupts and horses wander by our dead and their dead, we will be hopeful of Help from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. So do not listen to anything except for the sounds of the swords and the horses. O you people, lower your gaze and clench your teeth for it is intense for striking the head, and face the people by their faces, and take the swords in your right hand and strike the heads, and stab the spear into their hearts, with a fury of a people taking revenge for the blood of their fathers and their brothers against their enemies, having resigned themselves to death, so that you will not be humiliated nor will shame be necessitated for you in the world’.</p>
<p>ثم التقى القوم فكان بينهم أمر عظيم، فتفرقوا عن سبعين ألف قتيل من جحاجحة العرب. وكانت الوقعة يوم الخميس من حيث استقلت الشمس حتى ذهب ثلث الليل الأول. ما سجد لله في ذينك العسكرين سجدة حتى مرت مواقيت الصلوات الأربع: الظهر والعصر والمغرب والعشاء.</p>
<p>Then the people met (in battle) and between them was a great matter. So when they had dispersed seventy thousand from the well-known Arabs had been killed. And the event started on the day of Thursday from when the sun came out until a third of the night had gone by. No one from the army prostrated to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> with even one prostration until the time for four Prayers had passed by – Midday (Al-Zohr), and the Mid-afternoon (Al-Asr), and the Evening (Al-Maghrib) and the Night (Al-Isha) Prayers.</p>

<p>قال: فكتب معاوية إلى علي عليه السلام كتابا مع رجل من أهل السكاسك يقال له (عبد الله بن عقبة): (أما بعد، فإنك لو علمت أن الحرب تبلغ بنا وبك ما بلغت وعلمناه نحن، لم يجنها بعضنا على بعض. وإن كنا قد غلبنا على عقولنا فقد بقي منها ما نرم به ما مضى ونصلح ما بقي.</p>

<p>And I had asked you for Syria on the condition that it would not necessitate obedience to you nor allegiance. So you refused that to me, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Gave it to me what you<sup>-asws</sup> had not.

<p>By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, the livers have softened and the men have gone. And we are the children of Abd Manaaf, and there is no preference for one of us above the other by which the honourable one is disgraced, nor by which the disgraced one is enslaved. Greetings.</p>

Amro humiliated him over it, and he had forbidden it (not to write a letter at first place). And there was no one from the Qureish who had greater respect for Ali<sup>-asws</sup> than Amro after the day in which he<sup>-asws</sup> made him to fall down from his ride.</p>
<p>فقال عمرو: ألا لله درك يا بن هند * ودر المرء ذي الحال المسود أتطمع – لا أبا لك – في علي * وقد قرع الحديد على الحديد وترجو أن تخادعه بشك * وترجو أن يهابك بالوعيد وقد كشف القناع وجر حربا * يشيب لهولها رأس الوليد له جاواه مظلمة طحول *</p>
<p>Amro said (in a poem), ‘To Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is the level, O son of Hinda, and it is a dark condition of yours that you covet – it is not for you, with regards to Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> has struck iron with iron, and you hope to deceive him<sup>-asws</sup> by doubts. And you are hopeful of scaring him<sup>-asws</sup> by uncovering the lid and starting a war. The hair on the heads of children goes grey at the prospect of it.</p>
<p>فوارسها تلهب كالأسود يقول لها إذا رجعت إليه * وقابل بالطعان القوم عودي فإن وردت فأولها ورودا * وإن صدرت فليس بذي ورود وما هي من أبي حسن بنكر * وما هي من مسائك بالبعيد وقلت له مقالة مستكين * ضعيف القلب منقطع الوريد طلبت الشام حسبك يا بن هند * من السوءات والرأي الزهيد ولو أعطاكها ما ازددت عزا * وما لك في استزادك من مزيد فلم تكسر بهذا الرأي عودا * سوى ما كان، لا بل دون عود</p>
<p>He has people who go out like enraged lions, and he<sup>-asws</sup> says to them when they return and receives them with the taunt for they do not return as they went. This is not surprising for Abu Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, and it is not far from him<sup>-asws</sup>. And you have spoken to him with the words of a beggar, weak of heart with his vein cut off. You sought Syria which would have sufficed for you O son of Hinda. From a meagre opinion, even if he<sup>-asws</sup> were to give it to you, it will not increase your honour, and it would not be for you to increase your demands. You will not be able to break the promise with this opinion, even if it was anything other than a promise.</p>
<p><strong><u>فضيحة معاوية وعمرو بن العاص </u></strong></p>
<p>فقال معاوية: والله لقد علمت ما أردت بهذا. قال عمرو: وما أردت به؟ قال: عيبك رأيي وخلافك علي وإعظامك عليا، لما فضحك يوم بارزته. فضحك عمرو وقال: أما خلافك ومعصيتك فقد كانت، وأما فضيحتي فلم يفتضح رجل بارز عليا، فإن شئت أن تتلوها أنت منه فافعل! فسكت معاوية وفشا أمرهما في أهل الشام.</p>

<p>Muawiya said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I know what you intend by this’. Amro said, ‘And what do I intend by it?’ He said, ‘Your faulting of my opinion and your opposition to me and respecting of Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, when you were laughed at when you went against him<sup>-asws</sup>’. Amro laughed and said, ‘As for opposing you and being disobedient to you, that was what it was, and as for my being laughed at, so no man has been able to go against Ali<sup>-asws</sup>. So if you would like to recite from it, then do so’. Muawiya was silent, and the matter of these two spread among the people of Syria.</p>

<p>قال أبان: قال سليم: ومر علي عليه السلام بجماعة من أهل الشام فيهم الوليد بن عقبة بن أبي معيط وهم يشتمونه. فأخبر بذلك. فوقف فيمن يليهم من أصحابه ثم قال لهم: (انهضوا إليهم وعليكم السكينة وسيماء الصالحين ووقار الإسلام. إن أقربنا من الجهل بالله والجرأة عليه والاغترار لقوم رئيسهم معاوية وابن النابغة وأبو الأعور السلمي وابن أبي معيط شارب الخمر والمجلود الحد في الإسلام والطريد مروان، وهم هؤلاء يقومون ويشتمون. وقبل اليوم ما قاتلوني وشتموني وأنا إذ ذاك أدعوهم إلى الإسلام وهم يدعونني إلى عبادة الأوثان فالحمد لله قديما وحديثا على ما عاداني الفاسقون المنافقون. إن هذا الخطب لجليل، إن فساقا منافقين كانوا عندنا غير مؤتمنين وعلى الإسلام متخوفين، خدعوا شطر هذه الأمة وأشربوا قلوبهم حب الفتنة واستمالوا أهوائهم إلى الباطل. فقد نصبوا لنا الحرب وجدوا في إطفاء نور الله، والله متم نوره ولو كره الكافرون).</p>
<p>Abaan said that Sulaym said, ‘And Ali<sup>-asws</sup> passed by a group of Syrians among whom was Al-Waleed Bin Uqba Bin Abu Mueet and they were using obscenities against him<sup>-asws</sup>. So he<sup>-asws</sup> got to know of that. He<sup>-asws</sup> halted with his<sup>-asws</sup> companions then said to them: ‘Go to them in a tranquil state and with righteous countenance and maintain the dignity of Al-Islam.</p>
<p>Indeed, worse then us in the ignorance to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the audacity of the people and their delusion, is the group whose leader is Muawiiya, and Ibn Nabaga (Amro Bin Al-A’as), and Abu Al-Awr Al-Salamy, and Ibn Abu Mueet who is a drunkard who has been whipped due to it in Al-Islam, and the fugitive Marwaan, and these are the ones who are standing there speaking obscenities.</p>
<p>And before today they did not fight against me<sup>-asws</sup> or verbally abused me<sup>-asws</sup>, and I<sup>-asws</sup> used to call them towards Al-Islam and they were calling me to worship of the idols. So Praise be to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, for the mischievous ones and the hypocrites have been inimical towards me<sup>-asws</sup> before and now. This matter is to the Majestic<sup>-azwj</sup> that the mischievous hypocrites were in our presence not satisfied and to Al-Islam they were apprehensive. They deceived this community and made their hearts drink the love of sedition (Al-Fitna) and attracted their desires towards the falsehood. So they established the war against us in order to extinguish the Light of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, <strong><em>“[61:8] and Allah will perfect His light, though the unbelievers may be averse.”</em></strong></p>
<p>ثم حرض عليهم وقال: (إن هؤلاء لا يزالون عن موقفهم هذا دون طعن دراك تطير منه القلوب، وضرب يفلق الهام وتطيح منه الأنوف والعظام وتسقط منه المعاصم، وحتى تقرع جباههم بعمد الحديد وتنشر حواجبهم على صدورهم والأذقان والنحور. أين أهل الدين، طلاب الأجر)؟</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> incited against them and said: ‘These ones will not stop from this position of theirs unless they are challenged by which the hearts fly out, and they are struck by which the noses are ousted, and bones are broken and wrists fall off, and until their foreheads are knocked by the iron rods and their bones are crushed on their chests, and their chins and their collar bones are pulled out. Where are the people who seek the Hereafter?’</p>
<p><strong><u>حملة محمد بن الحنفية بأربعة آلاف على عسكر معاوية </u></strong></p>
<p>فثارت عليه عصابة نحو أربعة آلاف، فدعا محمد بن الحنفية فقال: (يا بني، امش نحو هذه الراية مشيا وئيدا على هينتك حتى إذا شرعت في صدورهم الأسنة فامسك حتى يأتيك رأيي)، ففعل.</p>

<p>Approximately four thousand came up to him<sup>-asws</sup>. So he<sup>-asws</sup> called upon Muhammad Bin Al-Hanafiyya and said: ‘O my<sup>-asws</sup> son, walk towards this flag with a slow walk until your spear heads are close to piercing their chests, So hold there until my<sup>-asws</sup> flag comes to you’. So he did that.</p>
<p>وأعد علي عليه السلام مثلهم، فلما دنا محمد وأشرع الرماح في صدورهم أمر علي عليه السلام الذين كان أعدهم أن يحملوا معهم. فشدوا عليهم ونهض محمد ومن معه في وجوههم فأزالوهم عن مواقفهم وقتلوا عامتهم.</p>
<p>And Ali<sup>-asws</sup> prepared the like of them. When Muhammad started piercing their chests with the spears, Ali<sup>-asws</sup> ordered the ones whom he<sup>-asws</sup> had prepared, to attack along with them. So they shook them, and Muhammad and those who were with him arose and moved them from their places, and killed most of them.</p>

<p>أبان عن سليم، قال: سألت المقداد عن علي عليه السلام، قال: كنا نسافر مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله – وذلك قبل أن يأمر نساءه بالحجاب – وهو يخدم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ليس له خادم غيره، وكان لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لحاف ليس له لحاف غيره، ومعه عائشة.</p>
<p>Abaan from Sulaym who said, ‘I asked Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup> about Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, he said, ‘We were travelling with the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> – and that was before he<sup>-saww</sup> had ordered his<sup>-saww</sup> wives for the veiling – and he<sup>-asws</sup> was attending to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and he<sup>-saww</sup> had no attendant for himself<sup>-saww</sup> apart from him<sup>-asws</sup>, and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had a quilt and he<sup>-saww</sup> had no other quilt apart from it, and with him<sup>-saww</sup> was Ayesha.</p>
<p>فكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ينام بين علي وعائشة ليس عليهم لحاف غيره، فإذا قام رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله من الليل يصلي حط بيده اللحاف من وسطه بينه وبين عائشة حتى يمس اللحاف الفراش الذي تحتهم، ويقوم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فيصلي.</p>
<p>The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was sleeping in between Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and Ayesha, and there was no other quilt for them apart from it. So when the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> stood up to Pray at night, he<sup>-saww</sup> moved the quilt by his<sup>-saww</sup> hands from his<sup>-saww</sup> waist and placed it between him<sup>-asws</sup> and Ayesha until the quilt touched the ground which was under them, and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> stood up and he<sup>-saww</sup> Prayed.</p>
<p>فأخذت عليا عليه السلام الحمى ليلة فأسهرته، فسهر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لسهره، فبات ليله مرة يصلي ومرة يأتي عليا عليه السلام يسليه وينظر إليه حتى أصبح. فلما صلى بأصحابه الغداة قال: (اللهم اشف عليا وعافه، فإنه قد أسهرني مما به من الوجع). فعوفي، فكأنما أنشط من عقال ما به من علة.</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> was overtaken by fever which kept him<sup>-asws</sup> awake at night. So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> stayed awake for his<sup>-asws</sup> vigilance. He<sup>-saww</sup> spent parts of the night such that at times he<sup>-saww</sup> Prayed, and at times he<sup>-saww</sup> came to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> to comfort him<sup>-asws</sup> and look at him<sup>-asws</sup>, until the morning. When he<sup>-saww</sup> Prayed the dawn Prayer with his<sup>-saww</sup> companions he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Heal Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and Give him<sup>-asws</sup> good health, for I<sup>-saww</sup> have stayed awake due to his<sup>-asws</sup> pain’. He<sup>-asws</sup> was cured and became more active than before.</p>
<p><strong><u>ما سأل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ربه لعلي عليه السلام </u></strong></p>

<p>Then the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Receive good news, O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother’. He<sup>-saww</sup> said that and his<sup>-saww</sup> companions were around him<sup>-saww</sup> listening.

He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> did not ask Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for anything last night but He<sup>-azwj</sup> Gave it to me<sup>-saww</sup>, and I<sup>-saww</sup> did not ask anything for myself<sup>-saww</sup> except that I<sup>-saww</sup> asked for you<sup>-asws</sup> the like of it.</p>
<p>إني دعوت الله أن يواخي بيني وبينك ففعل، وسألته أن يجعلك ولي كل مؤمن بعدي ففعل، وسألته إذا ألبسني ثوب النبوة والرسالة أن يلبسك ثوب الوصية والشجاعة ففعل، وسألته أن يجعلك وصيي ووارثي وخازن علمي ففعل، وسألته أن يجعلك مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى وأن يشد بك أزري ويشركك في أمري ففعل، إلا أنه قال: (لا نبي بعدك) فرضيت، وسألته أن يزوجك ابنتي ويجعلك أبا ولدي ففعل.</p>
<p>I<sup>-saww</sup> supplicated to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> that He<sup>-azwj</sup> may Establish brotherhood between myself<sup>-saww</sup> and you<sup>-asws</sup>, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Did that. And I<sup>-saww</sup> asked Him<sup>-azwj</sup> to Make you<sup>-asws</sup> to be the Guardian of every ‘Momin’ (believer) after me<sup>-saww</sup>, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Did that. And I<sup>-saww</sup> asked Him<sup>-azwj</sup> that since He<sup>-azwj</sup> had Clothed me<sup>-saww</sup> with Prophet-hood and the Message so He<sup>-azwj</sup> may Clothe you<sup>-asws</sup> with the successorship and bravery, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Did that.</p>
<p>And I<sup>-asws</sup> asked Him<sup>-azwj</sup> that He<sup>-azwj</sup> may Make you<sup>-asws</sup> to be my<sup>-saww</sup> successor, and my<sup>-saww</sup> inheritor, and the treasurer of my<sup>-saww</sup> knowledge, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Did that. And I<sup>-saww</sup> asked Him<sup>-azwj</sup> that He<sup>-azwj</sup> may Make you<sup>-asws</sup> to be of the status from me<sup>-saww</sup> which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had from Musa<sup>-as</sup> and Strengthen my<sup>-saww</sup> back by you<sup>-asws</sup> and include you<sup>-asws</sup> in my<sup>-saww</sup> command, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Did that, except that He<sup>-azwj</sup> Said: “There will be no Prophet<sup>-as</sup> after you<sup>-saww</sup>”.</p>
<p>So I<sup>-saww</sup> was happy, and I<sup>-saww</sup> asked Him<sup>-azwj</sup> that He<sup>-azwj</sup> may Get you<sup>-asws</sup> to be married to my<sup>-saww</sup> daughter, and He<sup>-azwj</sup> should Make you<sup>-asws</sup> the father of my<sup>-saww</sup> children, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> did that.</p>

<p>So a man said to his companion, ‘Did you see what he<sup>-saww</sup> asked for?

He said, ‘Ma’az Bin Jabal died by the plague. I was present on the day he died’ – and the people were busy with (protecting themselves from) the plague.</p>
<p>قال: فسمعته حين احتضر وليس في البيت معه غيري – وذلك في خلافة عمر بن الخطاب – يقول: ويل لي ويل لي ويل لي ويل لي فقلت في نفسي: أصحاب الطاعون يهذون ويتكلمون ويقولون الأعاجيب. فقلت له: تهذي رحمك الله؟ فقال: لا. فقلت: فلم تدعو بالويل؟ قال: لموالاتي عدو الله على ولي الله فقلت له: من هو؟ قال: لموالاتي عدو الله عتيقا وعمر على خليفة رسول الله ووصيه علي بن أبي طالب.</p>
<p>He said, ‘I heard him when he was in the agony of death, and there was no one in his house apart from myself – and that was during the Caliphate of Umar Bin Al-Khattab – he said, ‘Woe be unto me, woe be unto me, woe be unto me, woe be unto me’. So I said to myself, ‘Those who are stuck by plague, they rave and speak and say strange things’. I said to him, ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on you, are you delirious?’ He said, ‘No’. I said, ‘So why are you calling for woe?’ He said, ‘Due to my befriending the enemies of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> against the friend<sup>-asws</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>’.</p>
<p>So I said to him, ‘Who is he<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He said, ‘I befriended the enemies of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Ateeq (Abu Bakr) and Umar against the Caliph of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and his<sup>-saww</sup> successor<sup>-asws</sup> Ali<sup>-asws</sup> bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>

<p>I said, ‘Are you out of your mind?’ He said, ‘O Ibn Ghanam, By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I am not out of my mind, here are the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> both saying: ‘O Ma’az Bin Jabal, receive news of the Fire, you and your companions who said, ‘If the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passes away or is killed, we will keep away the Caliphate from Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, so we will never let it reach him<sup>-asws</sup>’, you and Ateeq (Abu Bakr), and Umar, and Abu Ubeyda, and Saalim’. So I said, ‘O Ma’az, when was this?’ He said, ‘During the Farewell Pilgrimage, we said, ‘We will overcome Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and will not let him<sup>-asws</sup> take the Caliphate during our lifetime’.</p>
<p>فلما قبض رسول الله قلت لهم: (أنا أكفيكم قومي الأنصار، فاكفوني قريشا). ثم دعوت على عهد رسول الله إلى الذي تعاهدنا عليه بشير بن سعيد وأسيد بن حضير، فبايعاني على ذلك. فقلت: يا معاذ، إنك لتهجر؟ قال: (ضع خدي بالأرض). فما زال يدعو بالويل والثبور حتى قضى.</p>
<p>When the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away, I said to them, ‘I am sufficient for my community, the Helpers, so suffice me for the Qureish’.

Then Abdullah Ibn Umar rectified it and was fearful that I would inform that to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> as he knew that I was one of those who loved him<sup>-asws</sup> and that I cut myself off (from others) to him, so he (abullah bin Umar) said, ‘My father was out of his mind’.</p>

I understood who he<sup>-asws</sup> meant by that, so I said, ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> have spoken the truth, O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, but I thought that a human being had narrated it to you<sup>-asws</sup>, and there was no one present with my father – when he was saying this – apart from myself’.</p>

<p>I met Muhammad Bin Abu Bakr, so I asked, ‘Did anyone witness the death of your father after from your brother Abdul Rahmaan and Ayesha and Umar’? He said, ‘No’. I said, ‘And did they hear what you heard?’ He said, ‘They heard parts of it, so they wept and said, ‘He is out of his mind’. But as for hearing all of what I heard, no’.</p>
<p><strong><u>أبو بكر يشاهد رسول الله وعليا عليهما السلام عند الموت </u></strong></p>
<p>قلت: والذي سمعوا منه ما هو؟ قال: دعا بالويل والثبور، فقال له عمر: يا خليفة رسول الله، ما لك تدعو بالويل والثبور؟ قال: هذا رسول الله وعلي معه يبشرني بالنار ومعه الصحيفة التي تعاهدنا عليها في الكعبة وهو يقول: (لعمري لقد وفيت بها فظاهرت على ولي الله أنت وأصحابك، فأبشر بالنار في أسفل السافلين).</p>

<p>فلما سمعها عمر خرج وهو يقول: إنه ليهجر. قال: لا والله ما أهجر، أين تذهب؟ قال عمر: أنت ثاني اثنين إذ هما في الغار. قال: الآن أيضا؟ أو لم أحدثك: أن محمدا – ولم يقل رسول الله – قال لي وأنا معه في الغار: (إني أرى سفينة جعفر وأصحابه تعوم في البحر). فقلت: أرنيها. فمسح وجهي فنظرت إليها فاستيقنت عند ذلك أنه ساحرفذكرت لك ذلك بالمدينة فاجتمع رأيي ورأيك على أنه ساحر؟ فقال عمر: (يا هؤلاء إن أباكم يهجر فاخبوه واكتموا ما تسمعون منه لا يشمت بكم أهل هذا البيت). ثم خرج وخرج أخي وخرجت عائشة ليتوضأوا للصلاة، فأسمعني من قوله ما لم يسمعوا.</p>
<p>When Umar heard it, he went out and he was saying, ‘He is out of his mind’. He (Abu Bakr) said, ‘No, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> I am not out of my mind, where are you going?’</p>
<p>Umar said, ‘You were the second of the two in the cave’. He said, ‘Now as well? Or have I not narrated to you that Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> – and he did not say ‘Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’ – said to me, and I was with him<sup>-saww</sup> in the cave: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> can see the ship of Ja’far<sup>-ra</sup> and his<sup>-ra</sup> companions floating in the sea’. So I said, ‘Show it to me’. So he<sup>-saww</sup> wiped my face. So I looked at him<sup>-saww</sup> and was convinced by that, that he<sup>-saww</sup> is was a magician. I mentioned that to you at Al-Medina. So we were both coincidental in our opinions that he was a magician?’</p>
<p>Umar said, ‘O you all, your father is out of his mind, so let it fade, and conceal what you have heard from him, lest the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household gloat over you’. Then he went out, and my brother went out, and Ayesha went out to perform ablution for the Prayer. So he made me hear from his words which he did not let them hear.</p>

<p>I said to him when I was alone with him, ‘O father, say, ‘There is no God but Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>’. He said, ‘I will not say it nor do I have the ability to do so until I go to the Fire and enter the coffin’. When he mentioned the coffin, I thought that he was out of his mind, so I said to him, ‘Which coffin?’ He said, ‘A coffin from the Fire locked by a padlock from the fire, in which will be twelve men, I and this companion of mine’. I said, ‘Umar?’ He said, ‘Yes, who else I would mean by it? And ten, who will be in a well in Hell, over which is a rock.

<p>I said, ‘Are you delirious?’ he said, ‘No, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I am not delirious. May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Curse Ibn Sahaak (Umar). He is the one who repelled me from the Remembrance (Al-Zikr) after it had come to me. So he is an evil companion, May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Curse him. Place my cheek on the ground’. So I place his cheek on the ground, and he did not cease to call for the woe and the destruction until he died.</p>
<p>ثم دخل علي عمر وقد غمضته، فقال: هل قال بعدي شيئا؟ فعرفته ما قال. فقال عمر: يرحم الله خليفة رسول الله، اكتمه فإن هذا هذيان، وأنتم أهل بيت معروف لكم في مرضكم الهذيان فقالت عائشة: صدقت وقالوا لي جميعا: لا يسمعن أحد منكم من هذا شيئا فيشمت به ابن أبي طالب وأهل بيته.</p>
<p>Then Umar entered, and he had already died. He said, ‘Did he say anything else after me?’ So made it known to him what he had said. Umar said, ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on the Caliph of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. Conceal it, for this was due to delirium, and you are a people of the house whose members are well known to be suffering from the illness of being delirious’.</p>
<p>Ayesha said, ‘You speak the truth’, and all of them said to me, ‘Let no one hear anything from this, or else Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> and the Ahl Al-Bayt will gloat over you.</p>
<p>قال سليم: فقلت لمحمد: من تراه حدث أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام عن هؤلاء الخمسة بما قالوا؟ فقال: رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، وإنه يراه في منامه كل ليلة، وحديثه إياه في المنام مثل حديثه إياه في الحياة واليقظة، فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قال: (من رآني في المنام فقد رآني، فإن الشيطان لا يتمثل بي في نوم ولا يقظة ولا بأحد من أوصيائي إلى يوم القيامة).</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘I said to Muhammad, ‘Whom do you see to have narrated to Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> about these five of what they had said?’ So he said, ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> sees him<sup>-saww</sup> in his<sup>-asws</sup> dream every night, and him<sup>-saww</sup> narrating it to him<sup>-asws</sup> in the dream is similar to him<sup>-saww</sup> narrating it to him<sup>-asws</sup> during his<sup>-saww</sup> lifetime and the wakefulness, for the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has said: ‘The one who sees me<sup>-asws</sup> in the dream, so he has seen me<sup>-saww</sup>, as the Satan<sup>-la</sup> cannot be like me<sup>-saww</sup>, neither in the sleep nor in wakefulness, and not be like any one from my<sup>-saww</sup> successors<sup>-asws</sup>, up to the Day of Judgement’.</p>
<p>قال سليم: فقلت لمحمد بن أبي بكر: من حدثك بهذا؟ قال: علي عليه السلام. فقلت: وأنا سمعته أيضا منه كما سمعت أنت. فقلت لمحمد: فلعل ملكا من الملائكة حدثه؟ قال: أو ذاك؟ قلت: وهل تحدث الملائكة إلا الأنبياء؟ قال: أما تقرأ القرآن: (وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي ولا محدث)؟</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘I said to Muhammad Bin Abu Bakr, ‘Who has narrated this to you?’ He said, ‘Ali<sup>-asws</sup>’. I said, ‘And I heard it as well from him<sup>-asws</sup>, just as you heard it’ So I said to Muhammad, ‘Perhaps an Angel from the Angels narrated it to him<sup>-asws</sup>?’ He said, ‘How can that be?’ I said, ‘Do the Angels narrate to any but the prophets<sup>-as</sup>?’ He said, ‘But have you not read the Quran, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[22:52] And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet, or a Muhaddith”</em></strong>?’ (Please note that the word ‘Muhaddith’ is missing from this Verse from the current version of the Quran).</p>

<p>(Sulaym) said, ‘I said to him, ‘Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, he<sup>-asws</sup> was a Muhaddith?’ He said, ‘Yes, and so was Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> a Muhadditha and she<sup>-asws</sup> was not a Prophetess, and Maryam<sup>-as</sup> was a Muhadditha and she<sup>-as</sup> was not a Prophetess, and the mother<sup>-as</sup> of Musa<sup>-as</sup>, she<sup>-as</sup> was not a Prophetess and she<sup>-saww</sup> was a Muhadditha, and so was Sarah<sup>-as</sup> the wife of Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup>, she<sup>-as</sup> saw the Angel who gave her<sup>-as</sup> the good news of Is’haaq<sup>-as</sup> and after Is’haaq<sup>-as</sup>, Yaqoub<sup>-as</sup>, and she<sup>-as</sup> was not a Prophetess’.</p>

<p>The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘My<sup>-saww</sup> nation will be dividing into three (main) branches after me<sup>-saww</sup> – a group which will have nothing resembling the falsehood.

<p>And a group of the people of falsehood, which will have nothing, resembling the truth. Their example is like the example of the rust upon the iron, whenever it is touched by the fire it increases in evil and rottenness. Their Imam will be one of these three.</p>

<p>So I asked them<sup>-ra</sup> about the three (sects), they<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘The Imam<sup>-asws</sup> of the truth and guidance is Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and Sa’ad Bin Abu Waqaas is the Imam of the hesitant ones’, and I was keen for them to name for me the third one.

<p>Sulaym said, ‘I narrated to Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> at Al-Kufa by what Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup> had narrated to me from the words of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> when he<sup>-saww</sup> saw the three from the people of Badr, from the Emigrants, from Qureish coming over.

<p>ثم أنشأ يقول: ألم تعلموا أن النبي محمدا * لدى دوح خم حين قام مناديا وقد جاء جبريل من عند ربه * بأنك معصوم فلا تك وانيا وبلغهم ما أنزل الله ربهم وإن * أنت لم تفعل وحاذرت باغيا عليك فما بلغتهم عن إلههم * رسالته إن كنت تخشى الأعاديا</p>
<p>Then he started saying (a poem), ‘Do you know that the Prophet Muhammad<sup>-asws</sup> stood up and called the people at Khumm, and Jibraeel<sup>-as</sup> had come from the presence of his<sup>-saww</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>. You<sup>-saww</sup> are infallible and they are not, so preach to them instantly of what has Descended from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, their Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>. (If) you<sup>-saww</sup> do not do it due to danger from those who rebel against you<sup>-saww</sup>, so you<sup>-saww</sup> have not preached anything from their Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Message if you<sup>-saww</sup> were afraid of the enemies.</p>
<p>فقام به إذ ذاك رافع كفه * بيمنى يديه معلن الصوت عاليا فقال لهم: من كنت مولاه منكم * وكان لقولي حافظا ليس ناسيا فمولاه من بعدي علي وإنني * به لكم دون البرية راضيا فيا رب من والى عليا فواله * وكن للذي عادى عليا معاديا ويا رب فانصر ناصريه لنصرهم * إمام الهدى كالبدر يجلو الدياجيا ويا رب فاخذل خاذليه وكن لهم * إذا وقفوا يوم الحساب مكافيا نقل لنا</p>
<p>So he<sup>-saww</sup> stood with it having raised his<sup>-asws</sup> wrist by his<sup>-saww</sup> right hand announcing in a high voice. So he<sup>-saww</sup> said to them: ‘The one whose ‘Mola’ Master I<sup>-saww</sup> was from among you, so remember my<sup>-saww</sup> words and don’t forget them, so his ‘Mola’ Master after me<sup>-saww</sup> is Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and I<sup>-saww</sup> am, by it, free from it and am pleased.</p>
<p>O Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, the one who befriends Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, so Befriend him, and the one who is an enemy to Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, so be an Enemy to him. And O Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, Help the one who is a helper to him<sup>-asws</sup>, the Imam<sup>-asws</sup> who guides like the full moon in the darkness. And O Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, Abandon the one who abandons him<sup>-asws</sup>, and for them, when they are stopped on the Day of Reckoning, move (away from) us’.</p>

<p>The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> stood up during the time of midday, and ordered for a tent to be set up, and ordered Ali<sup>-asws</sup> to enter inside it, and the first ones that the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> ordered were Abu Bakr and Umar.</p>
<p>فلم يقوما إلا بعد ما سألا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: هل من أمر الله هذه البيعة؟ فأجابهما: نعم، من أمر الله جل وعلا، واعلما أن من نقض هذه البيعة كافر ومن لم يطع عليا كافر، فإن قول علي قولي وأمره أمري. فمن خالف قول علي وأمره فقد خالفني.</p>
<p>Both of them did not stand up until after they asked the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, ‘Is the Order for this allegiance from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>’. So he<sup>-saww</sup> replied to them both: ‘Yes, from the Orders of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Majestic and High, and both of you should know that the one who breaks this allegiance is ‘Kafir’ (an infidel), for the words of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> are my<sup>-saww</sup> words, and his<sup>-asws</sup> command is my<sup>-saww</sup> command. So the one who opposes the words of Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, he has opposed me<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p>وبعد ما أكد عليهم هذا الكلام أمرهم بالإسراع في البيعة. فقاما ودخلا على علي عليه السلام وبايعاه بإمرة المؤمنين. وقال عمر عند البيعة: بخ بخ لك يا علي، أصبحت مولاي ومولى كل مؤمن ومؤمنة.</p>
<p>After having emphasised this speech to the two of them, he<sup>-saww</sup> quickly ordered them for the allegiance. So they both stood up and came up to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and paid allegiance to him<sup>-asws</sup> as ‘Amir-ul-Momineen’. And Umar said during the allegiance, ‘Congratulations, congratulations to you<sup>-asws</sup> O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, you<sup>-asws</sup> have become my Master and the Master of every believing man and believing woman’.</p>
<p>ثم أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله سلمان وأبا ذر بالبيعة، فقاما ولم يقولا شيئا….</p>
<p>Then the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> ordered Salman<sup>-ra</sup> and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> for the allegiance. So they both stood up, and did not say a thing.(but to submit)….</p>

<p>فقال: قال لي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: يا علي، أنت الأخ وأنت الخليل وأنت الوصي وأنت الوزير، وأنت الخليفة في الأهل والمال وفي كل غيبة أغيبها. ومنزلتك منى كمنزلتي من ربي، وأنت الخليفة في أمتي. وليك وليي وعدوك عدوي، وأنت أمير المؤمنين وسيد المسلمين من بعدي.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said, ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said to me<sup>-asws</sup>: ‘O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, you<sup>-asws</sup> are the brother, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are the friend, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are the successor, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are the Vizier, and you<sup>-asws</sup> are the Caliph regarding the Family and the wealth, and during every absence that I<sup>-saww</sup> am absent from it.

The faith will become more stable in his heart than the mountain of Ohad is in its place, and the one who does not have the effects of our<sup>-asws</sup> cordiality in his heart, the faith will dissolve in his heart like the dissolving of salt in the water.</p>

<p>Abaan from Sulaym, who said, ‘I heard Ali<sup>-asws</sup> saying; ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> took an oath from me<sup>-asws</sup> on the day he<sup>-saww</sup> passed away, and I<sup>-asws</sup> had supported him<sup>-saww</sup> by my<sup>-asws</sup> chest and that his<sup>-saww</sup> head was close to my<sup>-asws</sup> ears, and two of his<sup>-saww</sup> wives (Ayesha and Hafsa) were trying to listen to what he<sup>-saww</sup> had to say.

<p>ثم قال لي: يا علي، أرأيت قول الله تبارك وتعالى (إن الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات أولئك هم خير البرية)، أتدري من هم؟ قال: قلت: الله ورسوله أعلم. قال: فإنهم شيعتك وأنصارك، وموعدي وموعدهم الحوض يوم القيامة إذا جثت الأمم على ركبها وبدا لله تبارك وتعالى في عرض خلقه ودعا الناس إلى ما لا بد لهم منه. فيدعوك وشيعتك، فتجيئون غرا محجلين شباعا مرويين.</p>

<p>I<sup>-asws</sup> said, ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Rasool<sup>-saww</sup> know’. He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘So they are your<sup>-asws</sup> Shiites and your<sup>-asws</sup> helpers, and my<sup>-saww</sup> appointment and their appointment is at the Fountain on the Day of Judgement when the community will be scattered upon its knees, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Blessed and High will Begin Presenting His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures and will Call the people to which there is no escape for them from Him<sup>-azwj</sup>.

<p>O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, <strong><em>“[98:6] Surely those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book and the polytheists shall be in the fire of hell, abiding therein; they are the worst of men”</em></strong>, so they are the Jews, and the Clan of Umayya and their adherents.

<p>أبان عن سليم، قال: حدثني عبد الله بن جعفر بن أبي طالب قال: كنت عند معاوية ومعنا الحسن والحسين وعنده عبد الله بن العباس والفضل بن العباس. فالتفت إلي معاوية فقال: يا عبد الله بن جعفر، ما أشد تعظيمك للحسن والحسين والله ما هما بخير منك ولا أبوهما خير من أبيك، ولولا أن فاطمة بنت رسول الله أمهما لقلت: ما أمك أسماء بنت عميس دونها</p>
<p><strong>1 –</strong> Abaan from Sulaym who said, ‘Abdullah Bin Ja’far Bin Abu Talib narrated to me saying, ‘I was in the presence of Muawiya and with us were Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> and with him were Abdullah Bin Abbas and Al-Fazl Bin Al-Abbas. Muawiya turned towards me and said, ‘O Abdullah Bin Ja’far, your glorification of Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> is intensely great. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, neither are they<sup>-asws</sup> better than you, nor is their<sup>-asws</sup> father better than your father, and had not Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> daughter of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> not been their<sup>-asws</sup> mother, I would have said that your mother Asma’a Bint Umays is not lesser than her<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p>فغضبت من مقالته وأخذني ما لم أملك معه نفسي، فقلت: والله إنك لقليل المعرفة بهما وبأبيهما وبأمهما. بل والله لهما خير مني ولأبوهما خير من أبي ولأمهما خير من أمي. يا معاوية، إنك لغافل عما سمعته أنا من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول فيهما وفي أبيهما وفي أمهما، قد حفظته ووعيته ورويته.</p>
<p>So I got overcome by anger from what he said and lost control of myself, so I said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, you have very little understanding of them both<sup>-asws</sup> and their<sup>-asws</sup> father<sup>-asws</sup>. But, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, they<sup>-asws</sup> are both better than me, and their<sup>-asws</sup> father<sup>-asws</sup> is better than my father, and their<sup>-asws</sup> mother is better than my mother. O Muawiya, you are oblivious of what I heard from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying regarding them<sup>-asws</sup> both, and regarding their<sup>-asws</sup> father<sup>-asws</sup>, and regarding their<sup>-asws</sup> mother<sup>-asws</sup>. I have memorised it, and deliberated upon it, and reported it’.</p>
<p>قال معاوية: هات ما سمعت – وفي مجلسه الحسن والحسين وعبد الله بن عباس والفضل بن عباس وابن أبي لهب – فوالله ما أنت بكذاب ولا متهم. فقلت: إنه أعظم مما في نفسك. قال: وإن كان أعظم من أحد وحراء جميعا، فلست أبالي إذا لم يكن في المجلس أحد من أهل الشام وإذ قتل الله صاحبك وفرق جمعكم وصار الأمر في أهله ومعدنه فحدثنا فإنا لا نبالي ما قلتم ولا ما ادعيتم.</p>
<p>Muawiya said, ‘Tell me what you have heard’ – and in that sitting were Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, and Abdullah Bin Abbas, and Al-Fazl Bin Abbas, and a son of Abu Lahab<sup>-la</sup> – ‘for, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, you are not a liar nor have you ever been accused of it’.</p>
<p>So I said, ‘It is greater than what you think it to be’. He said, ‘And even if it is greater than Ohad and Hira (two mountains) put together. I don’t care, for there is no one from the people of Syria in this gathering, and when Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> killed your Master<sup>-asws</sup>, and dispersed your community, He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made the command (Caliphate) to reach its rightful owner (Muawiya) and its place. So narrate to us, for we neither care about what you say, nor what allegations you make’.</p>

Then there will be from the posterity of Muhammad<sup>-asws</sup>, one man<sup>-asws</sup> after another<sup>-asws</sup>, and there will not be for anyone (a say) in the command with them<sup>-asws</sup>’. Then he<sup>-saww</sup> reiterated it for a third time, then said: ‘And there is none from among them<sup>-asws</sup> except that he<sup>-asws</sup> is higher to the believers than their own selves, and there is not for anyone (a say) in the command with them<sup>-asws</sup>. All of them<sup>-asws</sup> are guides and guided ones, nine from the sons<sup>-asws</sup> of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p>فقام إليه علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام وهو يبكي، فقال: بأبي أنت وأمي يا نبي الله، أتقتل ؟ قال: (نعم، أهلك شهيدا بالسم، وتقتل أنت بالسيف وتخضب لحيتك من دم رأسك، ويقتل ابني الحسن بالسم، ويقتل ابني الحسين بالسيف، يقتله طاغي بن طاغي، دعي بن دعي، منافق بن منافق.</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> stood up, and he<sup>-asws</sup> was weeping, and said: ‘May my<sup>-asws</sup> mother<sup>-as</sup>, and my<sup>-asws</sup> father<sup>-as</sup> be sacrificed for you<sup>-saww</sup>, O Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, will you<sup>-saww</sup> be martyred?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Yes, I<sup>-saww</sup> will be made a martyr by being poisoned, and you<sup>-asws</sup> will be killed by the sword and your<sup>-asws</sup> beard will be dyed from the blood of your<sup>-asws</sup> head, and my<sup>-saww</sup> son Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> will be killed by the poison, and my<sup>-saww</sup> son<sup>-asws</sup> Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> will be killed by the sword, and he<sup>-asws</sup> will be killed by a tyrant son of a tyrant, one whose lineage is in doubt (Da’iy) son of one whose lineage is in doubt (Da’iy), a hypocrite son of a hypocrite’.</p>
<p><strong><u>هلاك أبي بكر وعمر وعثمان بتقرير معاوية </u></strong></p>

<p>So Muawiya said, ‘O Ibn Ja’far, you have said a great saying, and if what you have said is true, then I am destroyed, and so have the three before me, and all the ones who befriended them from this community, and the community of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> is destroyed, and the companions of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> from the Emigrants and the Helpers, apart from you all, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household and your<sup>-asws</sup> friends, and your<sup>-asws</sup> helpers’.</p>
<p>فقلت: والله إن الذي قلت حق سمعته من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فقال معاوية: يا حسن ويا حسين ويابن عباس، ما يقول ابن جعفر ؟ فقال ابن عباس: إن لا تؤمن بالذي قال فأرسل إلى الذين سماهم فاسألهم عن ذلك.</p>
<p>So I said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, this is the truth which I heard from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. Muawiya said, ‘O Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, and O Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, and O Ibn Abbas, what is Ibn Ja’far saying?’ Ibn Abbas said, ‘If you do not believe what he said, send a message to the ones who have been named (who listeners to the Holy Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> at that time), so ask them about that’.</p>
<p>فأرسل معاوية إلى عمر بن أبي سلمة وإلى أسامة بن زيد فسألهما، فشهدا أن الذي قال عبد الله بن جعفر قد سمعناه من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كما سمعه. وكان هذا بالمدينة أول سنة جمعت الامة على معاوية.</p>
<p>So Muawiya sent a message to Umar Bin Abu Salma, and to Usama Bin Zayd, so he asked them both. They both testified that what Abdullah Bin Ja’far had said, they had heard it from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, just as he had heard it. And this was in Al-Medina, in the first year that the community had gathered to Muawiya (his rule).</p>
<p>قال سليم: وسمعت ابن جعفر يحدث بهذا الحديث في زمان عمر بن الخطاب.</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘And I heard Ibn Ja’far narrate this Hadeeth during the era of Umar Bin Al-Khattab’.</p>

<p>Muawiya said, ‘O Ibn Ja’far, you have made us to listen regarding Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> and the father<sup>-asws</sup> of these two<sup>-asws</sup>, so what have you heard regarding the mother<sup>-asws</sup> of these two<sup>-asws</sup>?’ – and Muawiya was like mocking and denying – so I said, ‘Yes, I have heard from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saying, ‘There isn’t in the Paradise any dwelling which is more prestigious, and more higher, and more closer to the Throne of my<sup>-saww</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> than my<sup>-saww</sup> dwelling. We<sup>-asws</sup> will be in it, fourteen human beings. I<sup>-saww</sup>, and my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup> Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> is better than them<sup>-asws</sup> and more beloved to me<sup>-saww</sup> than them<sup>-asws</sup>; and Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>, and she<sup>-asws</sup> is the Chieftess of the women of the Paradise; and Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, and nine Imams<sup>-asws</sup> from the sons<sup>-asws</sup> of Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>فنحن فيه أربعة عشر إنسانا في منزل واحد أذهب الله عنا الرجس وطهرنا تطهيرا، هداة مهديين. أنا المبلغ عن الله وهم المبلغون عني وعن الله عز وجل. وهم حجج الله تبارك وتعالى على خلقه وشهدائه في أرضه وخزانه على علمه ومعادن حكمه. من أطاعهم أطاع الله ومن عصاهم عصى الله.</p>
<p>So we<sup>-asws</sup> will be fourteen human beings in one dwelling. Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Kept away from us<sup>-asws</sup> the impurities, and has Purified us with a thorough Purification, (we are the) guides and the guided ones. I<sup>-saww</sup> am the preacher from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and they<sup>-asws</sup> are the preachers from me<sup>-saww</sup> and from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic.

The one who obeys them has obeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who disobeys them<sup>-asws</sup> has disobeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>لا تبقى الأرض طرفة عين إلا ببقائهم، ولا تصلح الأرض إلا بهم. يخبرون الامة بأمر دينهم وبحلالهم وحرامهم. يدلونهم على رضى ربهم وينهونهم عن سخطه بأمر واحد ونهي واحد، ليس فيهم اختلاف ولا فرقة ولا تنازع.</p>
<p>The earth will not remain without them<sup>-asws</sup> even for the blink of an eye, and the earth will not be in a stable state except by them<sup>-asws</sup>. They<sup>-asws</sup> will be informing the community of the matters of their Religion, and what is Permissible for them and what is Prohibited for them. They<sup>-asws</sup> will be giving proofs of that which Pleases their Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> and they<sup>-asws</sup> will be preventing them from that which Displeases Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, by all of them<sup>-asws</sup> issuing the same commands and same prohibitions. There will neither be any differences among them<sup>-asws</sup>, nor any branches within them<sup>-asws</sup>,nor any conflicts.</p>
<p>يأخذ آخرهم عن أولهم إملائي وخط أخي علي بيده، يتوارثونه إلى يوم القيامة. أهل الأرض كلهم في غمرة وغفلة وتيه وحيرة غيرهم وغير شيعتهم وأوليائهم. لا يحتاجون إلى أحد من الامة في شيئ من أمر دينهم، والامة تحتاج إليهم. وهم الذين عنى الله في كتابه وقرن طاعتهم بطاعته وطاعة رسوله فقال: (أطيعوا الله وأطيعوا الرسول واولى الأمر منكم).</p>
<p>The last of them<sup>-asws</sup> will take from the first of them<sup>-asws</sup>, my<sup>-saww</sup> dictation put into writing by the hand of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> by his<sup>-asws</sup> hand, which they<sup>-asws</sup> will be inheriting it up to the Day of Judgement. The people of the earth will all be engulfed in negligence, and wanderings and confusion. They<sup>-asws</sup> will not be needy of anyone from the community with regards to anything from the commands of their Religion, and the community will be needy of them<sup>-asws</sup>. And they<sup>-asws</sup> are the ones whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Meant by in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book, and joined obedience to them<sup>-asws</sup> as being obedience to Him<sup>-azwj</sup> and the obedience to His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>. So He<sup>-azwj</sup> Said: <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[Shakir 4:59] O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among you.”</em></strong></p>
<p>قال: فأقبل معاوية على الحسن والحسين وابن عباس والفضل بن عباس وعمر بن أبي سلمة وأسامة بن زيد، فقال: كلكم على ما قال ابن جعفر ؟ فقالوا: نعم. قال: يا بني عبد المطلب، إنكم لتدعون أمرا عظيما وتحتجون بحجج قوية إن كانت حقا. وإنكم لتضمرون على أمر تسرونه والناس عنه في غفلة عمياء. ولئن كان ما تقولون حقا لقد هلكت الامة وارتدت عن دينها وتركت عهد نبينا غيركم أهل البيت ومن قال بقولكم فاولئك في الناس قليل.</p>
<p>(Sulaym) said, ‘Muawiya turned towards Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup>, and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, and Ibn Abbas, and Al-Fazl Bin Abbas, and Umar Bin Abu Salma, and Usama Bin Zayd, so he said, ‘Are you all (agreed) upon what Ibn Ja’far said?’ They said, ‘Yes’.</p>
<p>He (Muawiya) said, ‘O sons of Abdul Muttalib, you are all calling to a great matter, and you are arguing by strong arguments, if it is true. And you are all harbouring a matter which you should veil it, as the people are, with regards to it, unaware of it and in (total) blindness. And if what you all are saying is true, the community has been destroyed, and has reneged (become Murtad) from its Religion, and has abandoned the oath of our Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, apart from yourselves, the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, and the ones who say what you all are saying, for these ones are very few among the people’.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 2 * احتجاجات ابن عباس على معاوية </u></strong></p>
<p>فأقبل ابن عباس على معاوية فقال: قال الله عز وجل في كتابه: (وقليل من عبادي الشكور) ، ويقول: (وما أكثر الناس ولو حرصت بمؤمنين)، ويقول: (إلا الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات وقليل ما هم) ، ويقول لنوح: (وما آمن معه إلا قليل). وتعجب من ذلك يا معاوية ؟ وأعجب من أمرنا أمر بني إسرائيل. إن السحرة قالوا لفرعون: (اقض ما انت قاض إنما تقضي هذه الحياة الدنيا إنا آمنا برب العالمين). فآمنوا بموسى وصدقوه واتبعوه.</p>
<h2 id="2-argumentations-of-ibn-abbas-against-muawiya" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337842060"></a><a name="_Toc341095650"></a>2 – Argumentations of Ibn Abbas against Muawiya</h2>
<p>Ibn Abbas turned towards Muawiya. He said, ‘Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Said in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book <strong><em>“[34:13] and very few of My servants are grateful.”</em></strong>, and He<sup>-azwj</sup> Said <strong><em>“[12:103] And most men will not believe though you desire it eagerly”</em></strong>, and He<sup>-azwj</sup> Said <strong><em>“[38:24] except those who believe and do good, and very few are they”</em></strong>, and He<sup>-azwj</sup> Said for Noah<sup>-as</sup> <strong><em>“[11:40] And but a few were they who believed with him.”</em></strong>. And are you surprised from that, O Muawiya?’</p>
<p>And stranger than our affair is the affair of the Children of Israel. The magicians said to Pharaoh<sup>-la</sup> <strong><em>“[20:72] They said: We do not prefer you to what has come to us of clear arguments and to He Who made us, therefore decide what you are going to decide; you can only decide about this world’s life”.</em></strong> So they believed in Musa<sup>-as</sup> and ratified him<sup>-as</sup> and followed him<sup>-as</sup><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>فسار بهم وبمن تبعه من بني إسرائيل فأقطعهم البحر وأراهم الأعاجيب وهم يصدقون به وبالتوراة يقرون له بدينه، فمر بهم على قوم يعبدون أصناما لهم، فقالوا: (يا موسى اجعل لنا إلها كما لهم آلهة) ، ثم اتخذوا العجل فعكفوا عليه جميعا غير هارون وأهل بيته، وقال لهم السامري: (هذا إلهكم وإله موسى)، ثم قال لهم بعد ذلك: (ادخلوا الأرض المقدسة التي كتب الله لكم).</p>
<p>So he<sup>-as</sup> left with them, and with the ones who followed him<sup>-as</sup> from the Children of Israel. He<sup>-saww</sup> split the sea for them and showed them wonders, and they ratified him<sup>-as</sup> and the Torah, and accepted his<sup>-as</sup> Religion. So he<sup>-as</sup> passed with them by a people who were worshipping the idols that they had with them. So they said, <strong><em>“[7:138] O Musa! make for us a god as they have (their) gods”</em></strong>, so they devoted themselves to these apart from Haroun<sup>-as</sup> and the People of his<sup>-as</sup> Household, and Samiri<sup>-la</sup> said to them <strong><em>“[20:88] This is your god and the god of Musa”</em></strong>, then he<sup>-as</sup> said to them after that <strong><em>“[5:21] O my people! enter the holy land which Allah has prescribed for you”</em></strong>.</p>
<p>فكان من جوابهم ما قص الله في كتابه: (إن فيها قوما جبارين وإنا لن ندخلها حتى يخرجوا منها، فإن يخرجوا منها فإنا داخلون)، حتى قال موسى: (رب إني لا املك إلا نفسي وأخي فافرق بيننا وبين القوم الفاسقين)، ثم قال: (فلا تأس على القوم الفاسقين). فاحتذت هذه الامة ذلك المثال سواء.</p>
<p>From their answers is what story Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book:<em> <strong>“[5:22] They said: O Musa! surely there is a strong race in it, and we will on no account enter it until they go out from it, so if they go out from it, then surely we will enter”,</strong> </em>to the extent that Musa<sup>-as</sup> said:<strong><em> “[5:25] He said: My Lord! Surely I have no control (upon any) but my own self and my brother; therefore make a separation between us and the nation of transgressors.”,</em></strong> then He<sup>-azwj</sup> Said: <strong><em>“[Shakir 5:26] therefore do not grieve for the nation of transgressors”.</em></strong> So this community followed that example exactly<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>وقد كانت لهم فضائل وسوابق مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ومنازل منه قريبة، ومقرين بدين محمد والقرآن حتى فارقهم نبيهم فاختلفوا وتفرقوا وتحاسدوا وخالفوا إمامهم ووليهم حتى لم يبق منهم على ما عاهدوا عليه نبيهم غير صاحبنا الذي هو من نبينا بمنزلة هارون من موسى ونفر قليل لقوا الله عزوجل على دينهم وايمانهم، ورجع الاخرون القهقرى على أدبارهم، كما فعل أصحاب موسى عليه السلام باتخاذهم العجل وعبادتهم إياه وزعمهم أنه ربهم وإجماعهم عليه غير هارون وولده ونفر قليل من أهل بيته.</p>
<p>And there are for them<sup>-asws</sup> virtues and precedents with the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and status of being near him<sup>-saww</sup>, and they had accepted the Religion of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> and the Quran until they were separated from their Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>. So they differed, and separated, and were envious of and opposed to their Imams<sup>-asws</sup> and their<sup>-asws</sup> friends until there did not remain from them upon what their Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> had covenanted with them apart from our Master<sup>-asws</sup> who was of the status from him<sup>-saww</sup> which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>-as</sup>, and a very small number who met Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic whilst being upon their<sup>-asws</sup> Religion and having believed in them<sup>-asws</sup>, and the others returned, having turned backwards upon their heels, just as the companions of Musa<sup>-as</sup> had done by taking to the calf and their worshipping it, and they were alleging that this was their Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, they had gathered to it apart from Haroun<sup>-as</sup>, and his<sup>-as</sup> children, and a very small number from the people of his<sup>-as</sup> Household.</p>
<p>ونبينا صلى الله عليه وآله قد نصب لامته أفضل الناس وأولاهم وخيرهم بغدير خم وفي غير موطن. واحتج عليهم به وأمرهم بطاعته، وأخبرهم أنه منه بمنزلة هارون من موسى، وأنه ولي كل مؤمن بعده، وأن كل من كان هو وليه فعلي وليه ومن كان هو أولى به من نفسه فعلي أولى به من نفسه، وأنه خليفته فيهم ووصيه، وأن من أطاعه أطاع الله ومن عصاه عصى الله ومن والاه والى الله ومن عاداه عادى الله. فأنكروه وجهلوه وتولوا غيره.</p>
<p>And our Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> had nominated for the community, the most preferable of the people, and the highest of them, and the best of them at Ghadeer Khumm and at another place. And he<sup>-saww</sup> argued against them by him<sup>-asws</sup> and ordered to be obedient to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and informed them and he<sup>-asws</sup> is from him<sup>-saww</sup> of the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had from Musa<sup>-as</sup>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> is the Guardian of every believer after him<sup>-saww</sup>, and that the one whose Guardian he<sup>-saww</sup> was, so Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is his Guardian, and the one to whom he<sup>-saww</sup> was higher to than this own self, so Ali<sup>-asws</sup> is higher to him than his own self, and that he<sup>-asws</sup> is his<sup>-as</sup> Caliph among them and his<sup>-saww</sup> successor<sup>-asws</sup>, and that the one who obeys him<sup>-asws</sup> has obeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who disobeys him<sup>-asws</sup> has disobeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who befriends him<sup>-asws</sup> will be befriended by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who is an enemy to him<sup>-asws</sup>, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will be an Enemy to him. So they denied him<sup>-asws</sup>, and were ignorant, and turned away to others’.</p>
<p><strong><u>رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لم يرض بانتخاب الناس في الخلافة </u></strong></p>
<p>يا معاوية، أما علمت أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حين بعث إلى مؤتة أمر عليهم جعفر بن أبي طالب، ثم قال: (إن هلك جعفر بن أبي طالب فزيد بن حارثة، فإن هلك زيد فعبدالله بن رواحة)، ولم يرض لهم أن يختاروا لأنفسهم، أفكان يترك أمته لا يبين لهم خليفته فيهم ؟ بلى والله، ما تركهم في عمياء ولا شبهة، بل ركب القوم ما ركبوا بعد البينة وكذبوا على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فهلكوا وهلك من شايعهم وضلوا وضل من تابعهم، فبعدا للقوم الظالمين. فقال معاوية: يابن عباس، إنك لتتفوه بعظيم، والاجتماع عندنا خير من الاختلاف، وقد علمت أن الامة لم تستقم على صاحبك.</p>

<p>O Muawiya, do you know that when the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> sent (an army) to Mu’ta, ordered their commander to be Ja’far Bin Abu Talib<sup>-as</sup>, then said: ‘If Ja’far Bin Abu Talib<sup>-as</sup> dies, so it will be Zayd Bin Harisa, and if Zayd dies, so it will be Abdullah Bin Rawaahat’, and he<sup>-saww</sup> was not happy for them to chose for themselves, so how can he<sup>-saww</sup> leave the community without having explained to them who their Caliph would be? Yes, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, he<sup>-saww</sup> did not leave them in darkness or in confusion, but the people rode upon what they rode upon after the proof, and they lied against the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>So they perished, and the ones who followed them also perished, and they went astray and the one who followed them went astray, so the unjust people became remote’. Muawiya said, ‘O Ibn Abbas, you are uttering great things, and getting together with us would be better than the differing, and you know that the community was not steadfast with your Master<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p>فقال ابن عباس: إني سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (ما اختلف أمة بعد نبيها إلا ظهر أهل باطلها على أهل حقها)، وإن هذه الامة اجتمعت على أمور كثيرة ليس بينها اختلاف ولا منازعة ولا فرقة: شهادة أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله والصلوات الخمس والزكاة المفروضة وصوم شهر رمضان وحج البيت وأشياء كثيرة من طاعة الله، واجتمعوا على تحريم الخمر والزنا والسرقة وقطع الأرحام والكذب والخيانة وأشياء كثيرة من معاصي الله.</p>
<p>Ibn Abbas said, ‘I heard the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say: ‘No community has differed after its Prophet<sup>-as</sup> except that its people of falsehood overcame its people of truth’, and this community is united upon many matters in which there are no differences among them, nor any dispute or sects – testifying that there is no god but Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and that Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> is the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and the five Prayers, and the Zakaat, and the obligations, and Fasting in the Month of Ramadhan, and Pilgrimage of the House, and many things from the obedience to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and they are united upon the prohibition of the intoxicants, and the adultery, and the theft, and cutting off of relationships, and the lies, and the betrayal, and many things from the disobedience to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>واختلفت في شيئين: أحدهما اقتتلت عليه وتفرقت فيه وصارت فرقا يلعن بعضها بعضا ويبرء بعضها من بعض، والثاني لم تقتتل عليه ولم تتفرق فيه ووسع بعضهم فيه لبعض وهو كتاب الله وسنة نبيه، وما يحدث زعمت أنه ليس في كتاب الله ولا سنة نبيه.</p>
<p>And they have differed in two different ways: On the first, they killed each other over it, and separated into sects with regards to it and they became so that some of them cursed some others and kept away from them; whereas on the second, they did not kill each other over it, and did not separate with regards to it, and some of them gave leeway to some others with regards to it, and this is the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and what events were newly occurring, they thought that these are neither in the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> nor in the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>وأما الذي اختلفت فيه وتفرقت وتبرأت بعضها من بعض فالملك والخلافة زعمت أنها أحق بهما من أهل بيت نبي الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فمن أخذ بما ليس فيه بين أهل القبلة اختلاف ورد علم ما اختلفوا فيه إلى الله فقد سلم ونجا من النار ولم يسأله الله عما أشكل عليه من الخصلتين اللتين اختلفت فيهما. ومن وفقه الله ومن عليه ونور قلبه وعرفه ولاة الأمر ومعدن العلم أين هو، فعرف ذلك كان سعيدا ولله وليا. وكان نبي الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (رحم الله عبدا قال حقا فغنم، أو سكت فسلم).</p>
<p>And as for that which they differed with regards to it, and separated for it, and some of them kept away from some others, so it is the kingdom and the Caliphate. They thought that they are more deserving of these two than the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household of the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>So the one who took to that in which there were no differences in between the people of the Qiblah, and referred that in which there were differences, to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, so he remained safe and was saved from the Fire, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will not Question him on what was difficult for him from the two differing variations.</p>
<p>And the one who was Reconciled by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and his heart was Enlightened and he recognised the Wali-ul-Amr and the mines of the knowledge as to who they<sup>-asws</sup> were, so by understanding that he will be happy and Befriended by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> used to say: ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Mercy upon the servant who spoke the truth, or kept quiet, so he is safe’.</p>
<p><strong><u>جميع العلم عند أهل البيت عليهم السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>فالأئمة من أهل بيت النبوة ومعدن الرسالة ومنزل الكتاب ومهبط الوحي ومختلف الملائكة، لا تصلح إلا فيها لأن الله خصها وجعلها أهلا في كتابه وعلى لسان نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله. فالعلم فيهم وهم أهله، وهو عندهم كله بحذافيره، باطنه وظاهره ومحكمه ومتشابهه وناسخه ومنسوخه.</p>

<p>So the Imams<sup>-asws</sup> of the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household of the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> are the Mines of the Message, and the Place of the Book, and the landing Pad of the Revelation, and the interchange of the Angels, and it is not appropriate for it to be anywhere except among them, because Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Specialised them<sup>-asws</sup> and Made them<sup>-asws</sup> to be its rightful ones (Ahl) in His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book and by the tongue of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>So the Knowledge is within them<sup>-asws</sup> and they<sup>-asws</sup> are its rightful ones (Ahl), and all of it is with them<sup>-asws</sup> in its entirety – its Hidden, and its Apparent, and its Decisive, and its Allegorical, and its Abrogating, and its Abrogated.</p>
<p><strong><u>جمع وحفظ القرآن </u></strong></p>
<p>يا معاوية، إن عمر بن الخطاب أرسلني في إمارته إلى علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام: (إني أريد أن أكتب القرآن في مصحف، فابعث إلينا ما كتبت من القرآن). فقال عليه السلام: تضرب والله عنقي قبل أن تصل إليه. فقلت: ولم ؟ قال عليه السلام: لأن الله يقول: (لا يمسه إلا المطهرون)، يعني لا يناله كله إلا المطهرون. إيانا عنى، نحن الذين أذهب الله عنا الرجس وطهرنا تطهيرا.</p>

So he<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, you will have to strike my<sup>-asws</sup> neck before it arrives to you’. I said, ‘And why?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Because Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Said: <strong><em>“[56:79] None shall touch it save the purified ones”</em></strong>, meaning all of it will not be taken except the Purified ones<sup>-asws</sup>. It means us<sup>-asws</sup>, we<sup>-asws</sup> are the ones from whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Kept away the impurities, and Purified us<sup>-asws</sup> with a thorough Purifying.</p>
<p>وقال: (وأورثنا الكتاب الذين اصطفينا من عبادنا)، فنحن الذين اصطفانا الله من عباده ونحن صفوة الله ولنا ضربت الأمثال وعلينا نزل الوحي. قال: فغضب عمر وقال: إن ابن أبي طالب يحسب أنه ليس عند أحد علم غيره فمن كان يقرأ من القرآن شيئا فليأتنا به فكان إذا جاء رجل بقرآن فقرأه ومعه آخر كتبه، وإلا لم يكتبه. فمن قال – يا معاوية – إنه ضاع من القرآن شيئ فقد كذب، هو عند أهله مجموع محفوظ.</p>
<p>And Said: <strong><em>“[35:32] Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom We chose from among Our servants”</em></strong>, so we<sup>-asws</sup> are the ones whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Chosen from His<sup>-azwj</sup> servants, and we<sup>-asws</sup> are the elites of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and for us<sup>-asws</sup> examples have been struck and to upon us<sup>-asws</sup> is the Descent of the Revelation’. So Umar got angry and said, ‘The son<sup>-asws</sup> of Abu Talib<sup>-as</sup> thinks that there is no one who has knowledge apart from himself<sup>-asws</sup>, so the one who has read anything from the Quran, he should come to us with it’.</p>
<p>So if a man came with the (part of) Quran and read it out, and he had another person with him, so he (Umar) had it written, otherwise he did not have it written. So the one who says – O Muawiya – that something has been wasted from the Quran, so he has lied, for it is in the possession of its rightful ones<sup>-asws</sup> (Ahl), collected and preserved’.</p>
<p><strong><u>أول إعلان رسمي عن إعمال الرأى في دين الله </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم أمر عمر قضاته وولاته فقال: (إجتهدوا رأيكم واتبعوا ما ترون أنه الحق) فلم يزل هو وبعض ولاته وقد وقعوا في عظيمة، فكان علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام يخبرهم بما يحتج به عليهم. وكان عماله وقضاته يحكمون في شيئ واحد بقضايا مختلفة فيجيزها لهم، لأن الله لم يؤته الحكمة وفصل الخطاب. وزعم كل صنف من أهل القبلة أنهم معدن العلم والخلافة دونهم فبالله نستعين على من جحدهم حقهم وسن للناس ما يحتج به مثلك عليهم. حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل.</p>

<p>Then Umar ordered his judges and his governors saying, ‘Perform ‘<strong><em>إجتهدوا</em></strong>’ ‘Ijtihaad’, and formulate opinions, and follow whatever you opine, for it is the truth’. So he and some of his governors never ceased to be in great difficulties, so Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> used to inform them by what he<sup>-asws</sup> argued against them.</p>
<p>And his (Umar’s) office bearers and his judges used to issue rulings in one matter with differing judgements, so he (Umar) permitted it for them, because Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> did not Give them the Wisdom and the qualification of correct decision.

<h2 id="sermon-of-amir-ul-momineen-asws-regarding-the-description-of-the-pious" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337842067"></a><a name="_Toc341095657"></a>SERMON OF AMIR-UL-MOMINEEN<sup>-asws</sup> REGARDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PIOUS</h2>
<p>وعن أبان بن أبي عياش عن سليم، قال: قام رجل من أصحاب أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام يقال له (همام) – وكان عابدا مجتهدا – فقال: يا أمير المؤمنين، صف لي المؤمنين كأني أنظر إليهم. فتثاقل أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام عن جوابه، ثم قال: يا همام، اتق الله وأحسن، فإن الله مع الذين اتقوا والذين هم محسنون.</p>
<p>And from Abaan Bin Abu Ayyash, from Sulaym who said, ‘A man from the companions of Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> who was called Hamaan, stood up – and he was a devoted struggler (Mujtahid) –&nbsp; so he said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, describe the qualities of a ‘Momin’ (believer) to me in such a way as if I am looking at them’. So Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> paused for a while from answering him, then said: ‘O Hamaam, fear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and do good deeds, for Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is with those who are pious and do good deeds’.</p>
<p>فقال له همام: أسألك بالذي أكرمك وخصك وحباك وفضلك بما آتاك لما وصفتهم لي. فقام أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام على رجليه فحمد الله وأثنى عليه وصلى على النبي وأهل بيته صلوات الله عليهم، ثم قال: أما بعد، فإن الله خلق الخلق حين خلقهم غنيا عن طاعتهم آمنا من معصيتهم، لأنه لا تضره معصية من عصاه ولا تنفعه طاعة من أطاعه منهم. فقسم بينهم معايشهم ووضعهم من الدنيا مواضعهم. وإنما أهبط آدم إليها عقوبة لما صنع حيث نهاه الله فخالفه وأمره فعصاه.</p>
<p>Hamaam said to him, ‘I ask you by the One<sup>-azwj</sup> who Honoured you<sup>-asws</sup>, and specialised you<sup>-asws</sup>, and Loved you<sup>-asws</sup>, and Preferred you<sup>-asws</sup> by what He<sup>-azwj</sup> Gave to you<sup>-asws</sup>, describe them for me’.</p>
<p>So Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> stood up upon his<sup>-asws</sup> feet. He<sup>-asws</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup> and sent Greetings upon the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-saww</sup> Household, then said: ‘Having said that, surely Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Created the creatures, although when He<sup>-azwj</sup> Created them He<sup>-asws</sup> needless of their obedience and safe from their disobedience, because neither does the disobedience of the one who disobeys adversely affect Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, nor does the obedience of the obedient one benefits Him<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>He<sup>-azwj</sup> Distributed the sustenance between them and placed them in different places of the world. However Adam<sup>-as</sup> came down to it (frist) as a Punishment for what he<sup>-saww</sup> did what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Forbidden him<sup>-as</sup> to do, having violated His<sup>-azwj</sup> Order and disobeyed Him<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p><strong><u>المؤمن في الدنيا </u></strong></p>
<p>فالمؤمنون فيها هم أهل الفضائل، منطقهم الصواب وملبسهم الاقتصاد ومشيهم التواضع. خضعوا لله بالطاعة فمضوا غاضين أبصارهم عما حرم الله عليهم، واقفين أسماعهم على العلم. نزلت أنفسهم منهم في البلاء كالذي نزلت في الرخاء، رضى عن الله بالقضاء. لولا الآجال التي كتب الله لهم لم تستقر أرواحهم في أجسادهم طرفة عين، شوقا إلى الثواب وخوفا من العقاب. عظم الخالق في أنفسهم وصغر ما دونه في أعينهم.</p>
<h2 id="the-believer-in-the-world" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc337842068"></a><a name="_Toc341095658"></a>The believer, in the world</h2>
<p>The believers that are in it are the people of the virtues, their logic is righteousness, and their clothing is economical, and their walking is with humbleness. They subject themselves to obedience to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and lower their eyes from what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Prohibited to them, and devote their hearing to the knowledge. Their behaviour in afflictions is similar to their behaviour in prosperity, pleased with the Decision of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>If Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had not Decreed a term for them, their souls would not tarry in their bodies even for the blink of an eye in their desire for the Reward, and Fear from the Punishment. They consider the Creator to be Great for themselves and everything else seems little in their eyes.</p>
<p><strong><u>المؤمن والجنة والنار </u></strong></p>
<p>فهم والجنة كمن قد رآها فهم فيها منعمون، وهم والنار كمن قد رآها فهم فيها معذبون. قلوبهم محزونة، وحدودهم مأمونة، وأجسادهم نحيفة، وحوائجهم خفيفة وأنفسهم عفيفة، ومعونتهم في الإسلام عظيمة. صبروا أياما قصارا أعقبتهم راحة طويلة. تجارة مربحة يسرها لهم رب كريم. أرادتهم الدنيا فلم يريدوها وطلبتهم فأعجزوها.</p>

<p>They and the Paradise is as if they can see themselves in it having been Favoured by its Bounties, and they and the Fire is as if they can see themselves in it being Punished. Their hearts are in grief, they are safe within the Limits (of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>), their bodies are slim, and their desires are little, and their souls are chaste, and their help in Al-Islam is great. They remain patient for (some) days so that they will acquire a long rest. Their business was profitable which their Generous Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> Made it to be easy for them. The world wants them but they do not want the world, and it sought them but they are content without it.</p>
<p><strong><u>المؤمن في يومه ليلته</u></strong></p>
<p>أما الليل فصافون أقدامهم، تالين لأجزاء القرآن يرتلونه ترتيلا يحزنون به أنفسهم ويستثيرون به دواء دائهم، وتهيج أحزانهم بكاء على ذنوبهم ووجع كلوم جوانحهم. فإذا مروا بآية فيها تشويق ركنوا إليها طمعا وتطلعت إليها أنفسهم شوقا فظنوا أنها نصب أعينهم، حافين على أوساطهم، يمجدون جبارا عظيما، مفترشين جباههم وأكفهم وركبهم وأطراف أقدامهم، تجري دموعهم على خدودهم، يجأرون إلى الله في فكاك رقابهم من النار.</p>

<p>As for the night, they spend it upon their feet (worshipping), reciting parts of the Quran, reciting it gradually, grieving for themselves by it having been affected by it, healing their illnesses, their grief give rise to sadness within them (and eventually) leading them to weep for their sins.</p>
<p>So if they pass by a Verse in which there is an incentive, they turn their attention towards it in desire thinking that it has been established in front of their eyes and they are in the midst of it, they glorify a great glorification, they lay their foreheads and palm and knees on the floor (prostrate), tears flowing upon their cheeks hoping to go to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and free their necks from the Fire.</p>
<p>وإذا مروا بآية فيها تخويف أصغوا إليها مسامع قلوبهم وأبصارهم، واقشعرت منها جلودهم ووجلت منها قلوبهم وظنوا أن صهيل جهنم وزفيرها وشهيقها في أصول آذانهم.</p>
<p>And if they pass by a Verse in which there is a scare, they turn the ears of their hearts and their vision towards it, and the hair of their skin stands upon its ends due to it, and their hearts tremble, and they think that they can hear the groaning of Hell and its exhalation and its inhalation ringing in their ears.</p>
<p>وأما النهار فحلماء علماء بررة أتقياء، برأهم الخوف فهم أمثال القداح، ينظر إليهم الناظر فيحسبهم مرضى وما بالقوم من مرض، أو قد خولطوا، قد خالط القوم أمر عظيم. إذا ذكروا عظمة الله وشدة سلطانه مع ما يخالطهم من ذكر الموت وأهوال القيامة، فزع ذلك قلوبهم وطاشت له حلومهم وذهلت عنهم عقولهم واقشعرت منها جلودهم. وإذا استفاقوا من ذلك بادروا إلى الله بالأعمال الزكية، لا يرضون لله بالقليل ولا يستكثرون له الجزيل.</p>
<p>And as for the day, they are forbearing, knowledgeable, goodly, pious, away from fear, for they are like the arrows. When a person looks at them he reckons them to be struck by illness, and they are not a people struck by illness or surrounded by it, but they are a people surrounded by a great matter. When the Greatness of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is mentioned and the intensity of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Governance along with the mention of the death and the situation of the Day of Judgement, their hearts are alarmed by it, their understanding is deeply disturbed, and their intellects are stunned, and the hair on their skin stands upon its ends. When they regain their senses they take the initiative to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> by the pure deeds, not being happy with a few (submitting) to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and not considering a lot (of their deeds) to be sufficient.</p>
<p><strong><u>علامات المؤمن الظاهرية </u></strong></p>
<p>فهم لأنفسهم متهمون ومن أعمالهم مشفقون. إن زكي أحدهم خاف مما يقولون وقال: (أنا أعلم بنفسي من غيري، وربي أعلم بي من غيري. اللهم لا تؤاخذني بما يقولون واجعلني خيرا مما يظنون واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون، فإنك علام الغيوب وساتر العيوب).</p>

<p>They accuse themselves and are fearful of their own deeds. If someone praises them, they fear from what he is saying, and say (to themselves), ‘I know myself more than others, and my Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> is More Knowing of myself than others.</p>
<p>Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, do not Take me to account for what he is saying, and Make me be better than what he is thinking (me to be), and Forgive me of what he does not know (about me), for You<sup>-azwj</sup> are the Knowing of the hidden and the Concealer of the faults’.</p>
<p>ومن علامة أحدهم أنك ترى له قوة في دين، وحزما في لين، وإيمانا في يقين، وحرصا على علم، وفهما في فقه، وعلما في حلم، وشفقة في نفقة، وكيسا في رفق، وقصدا في غنى، وخشوعا في عبادة، وتحملا في فاقة، وصبرا في شدة، ورحمة للمجهود، وإعطاء في حق، ورفقا في كسب، وطيبا في الحلال، ونشاطا في الهدى، وتحرجا عن الطمع، وبرا في استقامة، واعتصاما عند شهوة.</p>
<p>And from the signs, one of them is that you will see in him strength in Religion and resoluteness in his gentleness, and compassion in his profound thoughts, and gentleness in intelligence, and moderation in wealth, and humbleness in worship, and toleration in poverty, and patience in difficulties, and merciful in the exertions, and a giver in rights, and a sharing in (their) earnings, and good in the Permissibles, and active in the guidance, critical of the greed, and respectful in uprightness, and holding back during desires.</p>
<p><strong><u>علامات المؤمن الباطنية </u></strong></p>
<p>لا يغره ثناء من جهله ولا يدع إحصاء عمله، مستبطأ لنفسه في العمل، يعمل الأعمال الصالحة. وهو رجل يمسي وهمه الشكر ويصبح وشغله الذكر. يبيت حذرا ويصبح فرحا، حذرا لما حذر وفرحا لما أصاب من الفضل والرحمة.</p>

<p>They do not get tempted by the praises of the ignorant, and do not count their (good) deeds, not delaying themselves in performance of the deeds, they keep doing good deeds. And he is a man who ‘hums’ (chant) thankfulness in the evenings and in the mornings and busies himself with the Remembrance.</p>
<p>He spends the night cautiously (in fear) and in the morning he is happy. He is fearful of what he should be fearful of, and happy with what he has been given from the virtues and the Mercy.</p>
<p>وإن استصعب عليه نفسه فيما تكره لم يعطها سؤلها فيما إليه بشره. ففرحه فيما يخلد ويطول، وقرة عينه فيما لا يزول. رغبته فيما يبقى وزهادته فيما يفنى. يمزج الحلم بالعلم والعلم بالعقل. تراه بعيدا كسله، دائما نشاطه، قريبا أمله، قليلا زلله، متوقعا أجله، خاشعا قلبه، قانعة نفسه، متغيبا جهله، سهلا أمره، حريزا لدينه، ميتة شهوته، مكظوما غيظه، صافيا خلقه، آمنا منه جاره، ضعيفا كبره، قانعا بالذي قدر له، متينا صبره، محكما أمره، كثيرا ذكره.</p>
<p>And if he finds difficulty upon himself which he does not like, he does not try to overcome it by surrendering to his ‘nafs’ (ego). So he is happy with that which is eternal and long-lasting and delights his eyes in what will not pass away.</p>
<p>He desires that which is to remain and refrains from that which is doomed for (destruction). He mixes the forbearance with the knowledge and the knowledge with the intellect. You will see him to be remote from laziness, working endlessly, close to his deeds, (considering them to be) little with Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, anticipating his death, humble in his heart, content with himself, his ignorance is absent, his matters are easy, safeguarding his Religion, his desires have been killed, controlling his temper, keeping clean (physically and spiritually), his neighbour is safe from him, his arrogance is suppressed, he is satisfied with whatever that has been Decreed for him, robust in his patience, decisive in his matters, and frequent in his Remembrance.</p>
<p>لا يحدث بما اؤتمن عليه الأصدقاء، ولا يكتم شهادة الأعداء، ولا يعمل شيئا من الحق رياء ولا يتركه حياء. الخير منه مأمول، والشر منه مأمون. يعفو عمن ظلمه ويعطي من حرمه ويصل من قطعه. لا يعزب حلمه ولا يعجل فيما يريبه، ويصفح عما تبين له. بعيد جهله، لين قوله، عائب منكره، قريب معروفه، صادق قوله، حسن فعله، مقبل خيره، مدبر شره. وهو في الزلازل وقور، وفي المكاره صبور، وفي الرخاء شكور.</p>
<p>He does not narrate what the friends have entrusted to him, and does not conceal the testimony of the enemies, and does not do anything from the truth to show off or to avoid embarrassment.</p>
<p>The good deed from him is (always) expected, and people are safe from him as the evil from him is never emanating. He excuses the one who is unjust to him, and he gives sanctuary to the one who comes to him, and maintains relations with the one who cuts it off from him. His forbearance does not separate from him and he does not rush into that which is doubtful for him, and tolerates what is clear to him.</p>
<p>And his ignorance is remote from him, his talk is soft, he dislikes finding faults, he is near to good deeds, truthful in his speech, beautiful in his deeds, goes forward with his good deeds and leaves his evil deeds behind. And he is firm in shaky situations, and in hardship he is patient, and in the prosperity he is thankful.</p>
<p><strong><u>المؤمن والناس </u></strong></p>
<p>لا يحيف على من يبغض، ولا يأثم فيما يحب، ولا يدعى ما ليس له، ولا يجحد حقا هو عليه. يعترف بالحق قبل أن يشهد به عليه. لا يضيع ما استحفظ عليه، ولا ينابز بالألقاب، ولا يبغي على أحد، ولا يهم بالحسد، ولا يضار بالجار، ولا يشمت بالمصائب. مؤد للأمانات، سريع إلى الصلوات، بطيئ عن المنكرات، يأمر بالمعروف وينهى عن المنكر. لا يدخل في الأمور بجهل ولا يخرج من الحق بعجز.</p>

<p>He is not unjust to the one who hates him, and does not sin in what he loves, and does not make a claim for that which is not for him, and does not fight against the rightful who is against him. He sides with the truth even before witnesses are brought against him. He does not waste that which he was guarding for someone else, taunt others with the titles (which they do not like), he is not unjust to anyone, and does not intent any jealousy, he does not harm the neighbours, and he does not gloat over (other people’s) calamities.</p>
<p>He returns the entrustments, quick to go towards the Prayers, slow towards the evil actions, he enjoins the good and forbids from the evil. He does not enter into the matters due to ignorance, and does not exit from the truth due to frustration.</p>
<p>إن صمت لم يغمه الصمت، وإن نطق لم يقل خطأ، وإن ضحك لم يعل صوته. قانع بالذي قدر له. لا يجمح به الغيظ ولا يغلبه الهوى، ولا يقهره الشح، ولا يطمع فيما ليس له. يخالط الناس ليعلم، ويصمت ليسلم، ويسأل ليفهم، ويتجر ليغنم، ويبحث ليعلم.</p>
<p>If he is silent, his silence does not grieve him, and if he talks, he does not speak errors, and if he laughs he does not do it in a loud voice. He is satisfied with what has been Decreed for him.</p>
<p>He does not go wild in anger and his desires do not overcome him, scarcity does not make him to be oppressive, and he does not desire for that which is not for him. He mixes with the people to learn, and keeps quiet to remain safe, and he asks to learn (not to embarrass others or to impress them), does business to profit by it, and holds discussion to learn.</p>
<p>لا ينصت للخير ليفخر به، ولا يتكلم ليتجبر على من سواه. نفسه منه في عناء، والناس منه في راحة. أتعب نفسه لآخرته، وأراح الناس من نفسه. إن بغي عليه صبر حتى يكون الله هو المنتصر له. بعده عمن تباعد عنه زهد ونزاهة، ودنوه ممن دنا منه لين ورحمة. ليس تباعده تكبرا ولا عظمة، ولا دنوه خديعة ولا خلابة، بل يقتدي بمن كان قبله من أهل الخير. فهو إمام لمن خلفه من أهل البر.</p>
<p>He does not listen to good to be proud by it, and does not speak to belittle others. He places himself in difficulties, and the people are in happiness from him, he tires himself for the Hereafter, and the people are happy from him. If he is oppressed he observes patience until Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Grants victory to him.</p>
<p>His remoteness from those who keep away from him is due to renunciation<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a> and his self-restraint, and his nearness to those who come near him is due to softness and his compassion. He does not distance himself due to arrogance and greatness, and does not come near to deceive and that which would cause harm, but he follows the example of the ones who were before him of the good people, and he leaves a good example for people (who would come) after him.</p>

<p>Abaan Bin Abu Ayyash, from Sulaym Bin Qays, from Salman<sup>-ra</sup>, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup> has said that, ‘A number of hypocrites gathered and said, ‘Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> is informing us about the Paradise and what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Prepared in it from the Bounties for his<sup>-saww</sup> friends and the people who obey him<sup>-saww</sup>, and about the Fire and what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Prepared in it from the fetters and the disgrace for his<sup>-saww</sup> enemies and the people who disobey him<sup>-saww</sup>. So if he<sup>-saww</sup> were to inform us about our fathers and our mothers and our places in the Paradise and the Fire, we would be able to understand what is awaiting (for us) sooner or later’.</p>
<p>فبلغ ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، فأمر بلالا فنادى بالصلاة جامعة. فاجتمع الناس حتى غص المسجد وتضايق بأهله. فخرج مغضبا حاسرا عن ذراعيه وركبتيه حتى صعد المنبر، فحمد الله وأثنى عليه ثم قال: أيها الناس، أنا بشر مثلكم أوحى إلي ربي، فاختصني برسالته واصطفاني لنبوته وفضلني على جميع ولد آدم وأطلعني على ما شاء من غيبه. فاسألوني عما بدا لكم. فوالذي نفسي بيده لا يسألني رجل منكم عن أبيه وأمه وعن مقعده من الجنة والنار إلا أخبرته. هذا جبرئيل عن يميني يخبرني عن ربي فاسألوني.</p>
<p>That reached to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, so he<sup>-saww</sup> ordered Bilal to call out the Call for the Prayer for gathering. So the people gathered to the extent that the Masjid was full and its people were squeezed.</p>
<p>So he<sup>-saww</sup> came out angrily with his<sup>-saww</sup> cuffs tucks-up, until he<sup>-saww</sup> ascended the Pulpit. So he<sup>-saww</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, then said: ‘O you people! I<sup>-saww</sup> am a human being like you all. My<sup>-saww</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> has Sent Revelation upon me<sup>-saww</sup>. So He<sup>-azwj</sup> Specialised me<sup>-saww</sup> by His<sup>-azwj</sup> Message, and Chose me<sup>-saww</sup> for His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet-hood, and Preferred me<sup>-saww</sup> over all the children of Adam<sup>-as</sup> and briefed me<sup>-saww</sup> with whatever He<sup>-azwj</sup> so Desired to from His<sup>-azwj</sup> hidden matters.</p>
<p>So ask me<sup>-saww</sup> whatsoever that occurs to you all. By the One<sup>-azwj</sup> in Whose Hand is my<sup>-saww</sup> soul, no man from among you will ask me<sup>-saww</sup> about his father and his mother and from their places from the Paradise and the Fire, except that I<sup>-saww</sup> will inform him about it. Here is Jibraeel on my<sup>-saww</sup> right. He will be informing me<sup>-saww</sup> from my<sup>-saww</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>. So ask me<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p><strong><u>سؤال الناس عن أنسابهم وعن الجنة والنار </u></strong></p>
<p>فقام رجل مؤمن يحب الله ورسوله، فقال: يا نبي الله، من أنا؟ قال: أنت عبد الله بن جعفر، فنسبه إلى أبيه الذي كان يدعى به، فجلس قريرة عينه.</p>

<p>A man who was a believer and loved Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>, stood up and said, ‘O Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, who am I?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘You are Abdullah Bin Ja’far’. So he<sup>-saww</sup> (informed) him of his lineage to his father who was the one he was claiming him to be. So he sat down with delight in his eyes.</p>
<p>ثم قام منافق مريض القلب مبغض لله ولرسوله فقال: يا رسول الله، من أنا؟ قال: أنت فلان بن فلان راع لبني عصمة وهم شر حي في ثقيف، عصوا الله فأخزاهم. فجلس وقد أخزاه الله وفضحه على رؤوس الأشهاد، وكان قبل ذلك لا يشك الناس أنه صنديد من صناديد قريش وناب من أنيابهم</p>
<p>Then a hypocrite stood up, who was sick of heart and had hatred towards Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and towards His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>. He said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, who am I?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘You are so and so, the son of so and so who is a shepherd of the Clan of Asmat and they are the evil tribe of Saqeef. They disobeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Disgraced them’. So he sat down, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Disgraced him and Exposed him to the people who were present, and before that the people had no doubts that he was an important one from the important ones of Qureish, and a tooth from their teeth (equal to their important personalities).</p>
<p>ثم قام ثالث منافق مريض القلب، فقال: يا رسول الله، أفي الجنة أنا أم في النار؟ قال: في النار ورغما فجلس وقد أخزاه الله وفضحه على رؤوس الأشهاد.</p>
<p>Then a third one stood up, a hypocrite, sick of heart, so he said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> will I be in the Paradise or in the Fire?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘In the Fire (and after) being humiliated’. So he sat down, and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Disgraced him and Exposed him to the people who were present.</p>
<p>فقام عمر بن الخطاب فقال: رضينا بالله ربا وبالإسلام دينا وبك يا رسول الله نبيا، ونعوذ بالله من غضب الله وغضب رسوله. اعف عنا يا رسول الله عفا الله عنك، واستر سترك الله. فقال صلى الله عليه وآله: عن غير هذا – أو تطلب سواه – يا عمر. فقال: يا رسول الله، العفو عن أمتك.</p>
<p>So Umar Bin Al-Khattab stood up. He said, ‘We are pleased with Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as our Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, and with Al-Islam as our Religion, and with you<sup>-saww</sup>, O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> as a Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and we seek refuge with Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> from the Anger of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the anger of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>. Excuse us, O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Excuse you, and veil us, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Veil you<sup>-saww</sup>’. He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘About others – or are you seeking to ask – O Umar?’ He said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, excuse your<sup>-saww</sup> community’.</p>
<p><strong><u>خلق رسول الله وعلي عليهما السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>فقام علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام فقال: يا رسول الله، انسبني من أنا، ليعرف الناس قرابتي منك. فقال: يا علي، خلقت أنا وأنت من عمودين من نور معلقين من تحت العرش، يقدسان الملك من قبل أن يخلق الخلق بألفي عام.</p>

<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> stood up. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, lineage me<sup>-asws</sup>. Who am I<sup>-asws</sup>, so that the people would understand my relationship with you<sup>-saww</sup>’. He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, I<sup>-saww</sup> and you<sup>-asws</sup> have been Created from two Pillars of Light which were both attached to the bottom of the Throne. These were Extolling the Holiness of the God<sup>-azwj</sup> from before he<sup>-azwj</sup> Created the creation by two thousand years.</p>
<p>ثم خلق من ذينك العمودين نطفتين بيضاوين ملتويتين. ثم نقل تلك النطفتين في الأصلاب الكريمة إلى الأرحام الزكية الطاهرة، حتى جعل نصفها في صلب عبد الله ونصفها في صلب أبي طالب. فجزء أنا وجزء أنت، وهو قول الله عز وجل: (وهو الذي خلق من الماء بشرا فجعله نسبا وصهرا وكان ربك قديرا).</p>
<p>Then He<sup>-azwj</sup> Created from these two Pillars, two white seeds which were joined together. Then He<sup>-azwj</sup> Transferred those two seeds into the honourable ‘sulb’ and into pure immaculate mothers, until He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made half of it to be in the ‘sulb’ of Abdullah<sup>-as</sup>, and half of it to be in the ‘sulb’ of Abu Talib<sup>-as</sup>. So one part is me<sup>-saww</sup>, and one part is you<sup>-asws</sup>, and it is the Statement of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic: <strong><em>“[25:54] And He it is Who has created man from the water, then He has made for him blood relationship and marriage relationship, and your Lord is powerful.”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>علي عليه السلام السبب بين الله وخلقه </u></strong></p>
<p>يا علي، أنت مني وأنا منك. سيط لحمك بلحمي ودمك بدمي. وأنت السبب فيما بين الله وبين خلقه بعدي. فمن جحد ولايتك قطع السبب الذي فيما بينه وبين الله وكان ماضيا في الدركات.</p>

<p>O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, you<sup>-asws</sup> are from me<sup>-saww</sup> and I<sup>-saww</sup> am from you<sup>-asws</sup>. Your<sup>-asws</sup> flesh is joined to my<sup>-saww</sup> flesh, and your<sup>-asws</sup> blood to my<sup>-asws</sup> blood. And you<sup>-asws</sup> are the medium in what is between Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures after me<sup>-saww</sup>. So the one who fights against your<sup>-asws</sup> ‘Wilayah’ has cut-off the Medium which is in between himself and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and he will spend his time in the Levels of Hell.</p>
<p>يا علي، ما عرف الله إلا بي ثم بك. من جحد ولايتك جحد الله ربوبيته يا علي، أنت علم الله بعدي الأكبر في الأرض، وأنت الركن الأكبر في القيامة.</p>
<p>O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> cannot be recognised except by me<sup>-saww</sup> and by you<sup>-asws</sup>. The one who fights against your<sup>-asws</sup> ‘Wilayah’ has fought against the Lordship of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>. O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, you<sup>-asws</sup> are the Great Banner of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> after me<sup>-saww</sup> in the earth, and you are the Great Pillar in the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p>فمن استظل بفيئك كان فائزا، لأن حساب الخلائق إليك ومآبهم إليك، والميزان ميزانك والصراط صراطك والموقف موقفك والحساب حسابك. فمن ركن إليك نجا، ومن خالفك هوى وهلك. اللهم اشهد، اللهم اشهد.</p>
<p>So the one who will be covered by your<sup>-asws</sup> ‘Wilayah’ (protected) would have succeeded, because the Reckoning of the creatures is to you<sup>-asws</sup> and what is with them is to you<sup>-asws</sup>, and the ‘al-Mezan’ (Divine Scale) is your<sup>-asws</sup> Scale, and the Bridge is your<sup>-asws</sup> Bridge, and the Pausing will be your<sup>-asws</sup> Pausing, and the reckoning will be your<sup>-asws</sup> Reckoning. So the one who comes towards you<sup>-asws</sup> will be saved, and the one who opposes you<sup>-asws</sup> has deviated and will perish. Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> be Witness (to this), our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> be Witness (to this)!’</p>

<p>Abaan from Sulaym who said, ‘Whenever the Qureish used to get together in their gatherings, if they saw a man from the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household, they would cut off their discussions. In one of their gatherings a man from among them said, ‘What is the example of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> among the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-as</sup> Household except like a palm tree growing in rubbish’.</p>
<p>فبلغ ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فغضب، ثم خرج فأتى المنبر فجلس عليه حتى اجتمع الناس، ثم قام فحمد الله وأثنى عليه، ثم قال: أيها الناس، من أنا؟ قالوا: أنت رسول الله. قال: أنا رسول الله، وأنا محمد بن عبد الله بن عبد المطلب بن هاشم، ثم مضى في نسبه حتى انتهى إلى نزار.</p>
<p>That reached the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, so he<sup>-saww</sup> was angry, and he<sup>-saww</sup> then came out to the Pulpit until the people gathered. Then he<sup>-saww</sup> stood up, so he<sup>-saww</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, then said: ‘O you people, who am I<sup>-saww</sup>?’ They said, ‘You<sup>-saww</sup> are the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> am the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and I<sup>-saww</sup> am Muhammad Bin Abdullah Bin Abdul Muttalib Bin Hashim<sup>-saww</sup>’.

<p><strong><u>خلق أهل البيت عليهم السلام ونسبهم </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم قال: ألا وإني وأهل بيتي كنا نورا نسعى بين يدي الله قبل أن يخلق الله آدم بألفي عام، وكان ذلك النور إذا سبح سبحت الملائكة لتسبيحه. فلما خلق آدم وضع ذلك النور في صلبه ثم أهبط إلى الأرض في صلب آدم. ثم حمله في السفينة في صلب نوح، ثم قذفه في النار في صلب إبراهيم. ثم لم يزل ينقلنا في أكارم الأصلاب حتى أخرجنا من أفضل المعادن محتدا وأكرم المغارس منبتا بين الآباء والأمهات، لم يلتق أحد منهم على سفاح قط.</p>

<p>When He<sup>-azwj</sup> Created Adam<sup>-as</sup> he<sup>-azwj</sup> Placed that Light in his<sup>-as</sup> ‘sulb’, then Sent it down to the earth in the ‘sulb’ of Adam<sup>-as</sup>.

<p>ألا وإنه ولي كل مؤمن بعدي، من والاه والاه الله ومن عاداه عاداه الله. لا يحبه إلا مؤمن ولا يبغضه إلا كافر. هو زر الأرض بعدي وسكنها، وهو كلمة الله التقوى وعروته الوثقى. (يريدون أن يطفؤوا نور الله بأفواههم والله متم نوره ولو كره الكافرون).</p>
<p>Nay! And he<sup>-asws</sup> is the Guardian of every believer after me<sup>-saww</sup>. The one who befriends him<sup>-asws</sup> will be Befriended by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who is an enemy to him<sup>-asws</sup>, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will be an enemy to him. None will love him<sup>-asws</sup> except a ‘Momin’ (believer) and none will hate him<sup>-asws</sup> except for an infidel. He<sup>-asws</sup> is the pivot of the earth after me<sup>-saww</sup> and its stabiliser, and he<sup>-asws</sup> is the Pious Word of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Firm Handle. <strong><em>“[61:8] They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths but Allah will perfect His light, though the unbelievers may be averse”</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Nay! And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Looked with a second Consideration, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Chose after us<sup>-asws</sup> twelve successors<sup>-asws</sup> from the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household. So He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made them to be the best of my<sup>-saww</sup> community, one<sup>-asws</sup> after the other<sup>-asws</sup>, like the stars in the sky, every star which sets is followed by one which rises.</p>
<p>They<sup>-asws</sup> are the Imams<sup>-asws</sup> of guidance, the guided ones<sup>-asws</sup>. The conspiracies of the conspirators does not affect them<sup>-asws</sup> adversely nor does the desertion of the one who deserts them<sup>-asws</sup>. They<sup>-asws</sup> are the Proofs of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> in His<sup>-azwj</sup> earth, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Witnesses over His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures, and the Treasurers of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Knowledge, and the Interpreters of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Revelation, and the Mines of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Wisdom.</p>
<p>The one who obeys them<sup>-asws</sup> has obeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the one who disobeys them<sup>-asws</sup> has disobeyed Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.

<p>أبان بن أبي عياش عن سليم بن قيس، قال: كنت عند عبد الله بن عباس في بيته ومعنا جماعة من شيعة علي عليه السلام، فحدثنا فكان فيما حدثنا أن قال: يا إخوتي، توفي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يوم توفي فلم يوضع في حفرته حتى نكث الناس وارتدوا وأجمعوا على الخلاف. واشتغل علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حتى فرغ من غسله وتكفينه وتحنيطه ووضعه في حفرته. ثم أقبل على تأليف القرآن وشغل عنهم بوصية رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، ولم يكن همته الملك لما كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أخبره عن القوم.</p>
<p>Abaan Bin Abu Ayyash, from Sulaym Bin Qays who said, ‘I was in the presence of Abdullah Bin Abbas in his house, and with us was a group of Shiites of Ali<sup>-asws</sup>. So he narrated to us, and included in these narrations was that he said, ‘O my brothers, the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away on the day in which he<sup>-saww</sup> passed away. He<sup>-saww</sup> had not even been placed in his<sup>-saww</sup> grave, and the people broke (the Covenant), and turned apostates, and got united in their opposition. And Ali Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> was preoccupied with the Rasool Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> until he<sup>-asws</sup> was free from having washed him<sup>-saww</sup>, shrouded him<sup>-saww</sup>, and placed him<sup>-saww</sup> in his<sup>-saww</sup> grave. Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> turned (his<sup>-asws</sup> attention) towards compilation of the Quran and busied himself<sup>-asws</sup> away from them as per the bequest of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> had no ambitions for the position (Caliphate) since the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had informed him<sup>-asws</sup> about the people.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 1 * أخذ البيعة من علي عليه السلام بالإكراه </u></strong></p>
<p>فلما افتتن الناس بالذي افتتنوا به من الرجلين، فلم يبق إلا علي وبنو هاشم وأبو ذر والمقداد وسلمان في أناس معهم يسير، قال عمر لأبي بكر: (يا هذا، إن الناس أجمعين قد بايعوك ما خلا هذا الرجل وأهل بيته وهؤلاء النفر، فابعث إليه).</p>

<p>When the people had fascinated themselves with the fascination of the two men, and when there did not remain any except for Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and the Clan of Hashim<sup>-as</sup>, and Abu Dahrr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Salman<sup>-ra</sup> among very few of the people, Umar said to Abu Bakr, ‘O you, all of the people have paid allegiance to you except for this man<sup>-asws</sup> and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-asws</sup> Household and those few numbers, so send for them’.</p>
<p>فبعث إليه ابن عم لعمر يقال له (قنفذ) فقال له: (يا قنفذ، انطلق إلى علي فقل له: أجب خليفة رسول الله). فانطلق فأبلغه. فقال علي عليه السلام: (ما أسرع ما كذبتم على رسول الله، نكثتم وارتددتم. والله ما استخلف رسول الله غيري. فارجع يا قنفذ فإنما أنت رسول، فقل له: قال لك علي: والله ما استخلفك رسول الله وإنك لتعلم من خليفة رسول الله).</p>
<p>So he (Abu Bakr) sent to him<sup>-asws</sup> Umar’s cousin who was called Qunfuz, saying to him, ‘O Qunfuz, go to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and say to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘Answer (the call) of the Caliph of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’. So he went and told him<sup>-asws</sup>. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘How easily you have forged lies against the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, breaking (the Covenant) with him<sup>-saww</sup> and turning apostates. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> did not leave behind anyone apart from me<sup>-asws</sup>. So, return, O Qunfuz, for you are only a messenger, and say to him, ‘Ali<sup>-asws</sup> says to you: ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> did not appoint you as a Caliph, and you very well know who the Caliph of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> actually is’.</p>
<p>فأقبل قنفذ إلى أبي بكر فبلغه الرسالة. فقال أبو بكر: (صدق علي، ما استخلفني رسول الله) فغضب عمر ووثب وقام. فقال أبو بكر: (إجلس). ثم قال لقنفذ: (إذهب إليه فقل له: (أجب أمير المؤمنين أبا بكر) فأقبل قنفذ حتى دخل على علي عليه السلام فأبلغه الرسالة. فقال عليه السلام: (كذب والله، انطلق إليه فقل له: والله لقد تسميت باسم ليس لك، فقد علمت أن أمير المؤمنين غيرك).</p>
<p>So Qunfuz went back to Abu Bakr and narrated to him the message. Abu Bakr said, ‘Ali<sup>-asws</sup> spoke the truth, the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> did not appoint me as a Caliph’. Umar got angry and jumped to his feet. Abu Bakr said, ‘Sit down!’ Then he said to Qunfuz, ‘Go to him<sup>-asws</sup> and say to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘Answer (to the call of) Amir-ul-Momineen Abu Bakr’.</p>
<p>So Qunfuz went back until he came up to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and narrated the message to him<sup>-asws</sup>. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> he has lied! Go back to him and say to him: ‘You have named yourself with a name which is not for you. You know that the Amir-ul-Momineen is someone other than you’.</p>
<p>فرجع قنفذ فأخبرهما. فوثب عمر غضبان فقال: (والله إني لعارف بسخفه وضعف رأيه وإنه لا يستقيم لنا أمر حتى نقتله فخلني آتك برأسه) فقال أبو بكر: (إجلس)، فأبى فأقسم عليه فجلس. ثم قال: يا قنفذ، انطلق فقل له: (أجب أبا بكر). فأقبل قنفذ فقال: (يا علي، أجب أبا بكر). فقال علي عليه السلام: (إني لفي شغل عنه، وما كنت بالذي أترك وصية خليلي وأخي، وأنطلق إلى أبي بكر وما اجتمعتم عليه من الجور).</p>
<p>So Qunfuz went back and informed both of them. Umar leapt up angrily and said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I know his<sup>-asws</sup> silliness and the weakness of his<sup>-asws</sup> argument, our command will not be stable for us until we kill him<sup>-asws</sup>, so leave me and I will come to you with his<sup>-asws</sup> head’.</p>
<p>Abu Bakr said, ‘Sit down!’ He refused, so Abu Bakr held him on oath. So he sat down. Then (Abu Bakr) said, ‘O Qunfuz, go to him<sup>-asws</sup> and say, ‘Answer (the call) of Abu Bakr’. Qunfuz went back and said, ‘O Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, answer (the call of) Abu Bakr’. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-asws</sup> do not want to be distracted from it, and I<sup>-asws</sup> am not of those who will leave the bequest of my<sup>-asws</sup> friend<sup>-saww</sup> and my<sup>-asws</sup> brother<sup>-saww</sup>, and you go back to Abu Bakr and those unjust ones who have gathered around him’.</p>
<p><strong><u>هجومهم على بيت فاطمة عليها السلام وإحراقه </u></strong></p>
<p>فانطلق قنفذ فأخبر أبا بكر. فوثب عمر غضبان، فنادى خالد بن الوليد وقنفذا فأمرهما أن يحملا حطبا ونارا. ثم أقبل حتى انتهى إلى باب علي عليه السلام، وفاطمة عليها السلام قاعدة خلف الباب، قد عصبت رأسها ونحل جسمها في وفاة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فأقبل عمر حتى ضرب الباب، ثم نادى: (يا بن أبي طالب، افتح الباب). فقالت فاطمة عليها السلام: (يا عمر، ما لنا ولك؟ لا تدعنا وما نحن فيه). قال: (افتحي الباب وإلا أحرقناه عليكم) فقال: (يا عمر، أما تتقي الله عز وجل، تدخل على بيتي وتهجم على داري)؟ فأبى أن ينصرف. ثم دعا عمر بالنار فأضرمها في الباب فأحرق الباب، ثم دفعه عمر.</p>

<p>So Qunfuz went and informed Abu Bakr. Umar leapt up angrily and called Khalid Bin Waleed, and Qunfuz. He ordered both of them to carry firewood and fire. Then they went until they ended up at the door of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and Fatima<sup>-asws</sup>. She<sup>-asws</sup> was sitting behind the door, and she<sup>-asws</sup> had tied a piece of cloth to her<sup>-asws</sup> head and her<sup>-asws</sup> body had become thin (weak) due to the passing away of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>Umar came up until he struck (banged on) the door, then called out, ‘O son<sup>-asws</sup> of Abu Talib<sup>-as</sup>, open the door!’ Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Umar, what is it with us<sup>-asws</sup> and you? Why don’t you leave us<sup>-asws</sup> in the situation that we<sup>-asws</sup> are in?’ He said, ‘Open the door or I will burn it down upon you<sup>-asws</sup>’. She<sup>-asws</sup> said, ‘O Umar, but fear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic, you will enter into my<sup>-asws</sup> house, and make an assault upon my<sup>-asws</sup> door?’ He refused to leave. Then Umar called for the fire, so he kindled it by the door. The door burnt, then Umar pushed it.</p>

<p>Abu Bakr said, ‘That was what is was O Bureyda, but you were absent and we were present, and one matter transpires after the other matter’. Umar said, ‘And what has this to do with you, O Bureyda? And what is making you include yourself in this?’ Bureyda said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I shall not live in the country in which the two of you are the rulers’. So Umar ordered for him to be beaten and thrown out.</p>
<p>ثم قام سلمان فقال: (يا أبا بكر، اتق الله وقم عن هذا المجلس، ودعه لأهله يأكلوا به رغدا إلى يوم القيامة، لا يختلف على هذه الأمة سيفان)، فلم يجبه أبو بكر. فأعاد سلمان فقال مثلها. فانتهره عمر وقال: ما لك ولهذا الأمر؟ وما يدخلك فيما هيهنا؟ فقال: مهلا يا عمر، قم يا أبا بكر عن هذا المجلس، ودعه لأهله يأكلوا به والله خضرا إلى يوم القيامة، وإن أبيتم لتحلبن به دما وليطمعن فيه الطلقاء والطرداء والمنافقون. والله لو أعلم أني أدفع ضيما أو أعز لله دينا لوضعت سيفي على عاتقي ثم ضربت به قدما. أتثبون على وصي رسول الله؟ فأبشروا بالبلاء وأقنطوا من الرخاء.</p>
<p>Then Salman<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘O Abu Bakr, fear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and stand (leave) from this seating (Pulpit), and leave it for its deserving one<sup>-asws</sup>, so he<sup>-asws</sup> will make you to eat plentifully by it up to the Day of Judgement. Do not (create) differences in this community by two swords’. Abu Bakr did not reply to him. So Salman<sup>-ra</sup> reiterated it and said similar to it. Umar rebuked him<sup>-ra</sup> and said, ‘What is it to you and this matter? And what makes you to include yourself in what is happening here?’</p>
<p>He<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘Keep quiet O Umar! Stand-up, O Abu Bakr from this seating (the Pulpit) and leave it for its deserving one<sup>-asws</sup>, he<sup>-asws</sup> will make you to eat by it green (harvest) up to the Day of Judgement, and if you refuse, you will end up making the milk to turn into blood, and the freed captives, and the castaways and the hypocrites will have greed with regards to this Caliphate. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if I<sup>-ra</sup> knew that I<sup>-ra</sup> could repel injustice, or bestow honour to the Religion of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I<sup>-ra</sup> would place my<sup>-ra</sup> sword upon my<sup>-ra</sup> shoulders, then strike with it every step of the way. You are attacking the successor<sup>-asws</sup> of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>? So receive news of afflictions and remoteness from the prosperity’.</p>
<p>ثم قام أبو ذر والمقداد وعمار، فقالوا لعلي عليه السلام: (ما تأمر؟ والله إن أمرتنا لنضربن بالسيف حتى نقتل). فقال علي عليه السلام: (كفوا رحمكم الله واذكروا عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وما أوصاكم به)، فكفوا.</p>
<p>Then Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad, and Ammar stood up and said to Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘What is your<sup>-asws</sup> order? By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, If you<sup>-asws</sup> order us, we will strike with the sword until we die’. Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Restrain, may Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> have Mercy on you, and remember the oath of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and what he<sup>-saww</sup> has bequeathed to us by it’. So they held back.</p>
<p><strong><u>التهديد الثاني لعلي عليه السلام </u></strong></p>

<p>Umar said to Abu Bakr – and he was sitting upon the Pulpit -: ‘What (are you doing) being seated upon the Pulpit, and this (Ali<sup>-asws</sup>) is a seated warrior, he<sup>-asws</sup> is not standing up among us, so that he<sup>-asws</sup> pays allegiance to you? Or give the order so that his<sup>-asws</sup> neck be struck?’ – And Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup> were standing by the head of Ali<sup>-asws</sup> – when they<sup>-asws</sup> heard the words of Umar, they<sup>-asws</sup> cried and raise their<sup>-asws</sup> voices: ‘O Grandfather, O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>!’ Ali<sup>-asws</sup> gathered them<sup>-asws</sup> to his<sup>-asws</sup> chest and said: ‘Do not weep, for, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, these two do not have the ability to kill your<sup>-asws</sup> father. They are both lower, and spineless, and more disgraceful than that’.</p>
<p>وأقبلت أم أيمن النوبية حاضنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وأم سلمة فقالتا: (يا عتيق، ما أسرع ما أبديتم حسدكم لآل محمد). فأمر بهما عمر أن تخرجا من المسجد، وقال: (ما لنا وللنساء)</p>
<p>And Umm Ayman Al-Nowbiyat, nursemaid of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and Umm Salma<sup>-ra</sup> came up and (they both) said, ‘O Ateeq (Abu Bakr), how quickly you all have showed your envy against the Family<sup>-asws</sup> of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup>. So Umar ordered for both of them to be thrown out from the Masjid and said, ‘What have we to do with the women’.</p>
<p><strong><u>التهديد الثالث لعلي عليه السلام </u></strong></p>

<p><strong><u>التهديد الرابع لعلي عليه السلام</u></strong></p>
<p>فوثب خالد بن الوليد واخترط سيفه وقال: (والله إن لم تفعل لأقتلنك). فقام إليه علي عليه السلام وأخذ بمجامع ثوبه ثم دفعه حتى ألقاه على قفاه ووقع السيف من يده</p>

<p>Khalid Bin Waleed leapt up and unsheathed his sword, and said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if you<sup>-asws</sup> don’t do it, we will kill you<sup>-asws</sup>’. So Ali<sup>-asws</sup> stood up and grabbed hold of his clothes, then flung him (to the ground) by the scruff of his neck, and the sword fell from his hand.</p>
<p><strong><u>التهديد الخامس لعلي عليه السلام </u></strong></p>
<p>فقال عمر: قم يا علي بن أبي طالب فبايع. قال عليه السلام: فإن لم أفعل؟ قال: (إذا والله نقتلك). واحتج عليهم علي عليه السلام ثلاث مرات، ثم مد يده من غير أن يفتح كفه فضرب عليها أبو بكر ورضي منه بذلك. ثم توجه إلى منزله وتبعه الناس.</p>

<p><strong><u>منع عمر من كتاب أبي بكر برد فدك </u></strong></p>
<p>فلما سمع أبو بكر مقالتها والنسوة معها دعا بدواة ليكتب به لها. فدخل عمر فقال: يا خليفة رسول الله، لا تكتب لها حتى تقيم البينة بما تدعي. فقالت فاطمة عليها السلام: نعم، أقيم البينة. قال: من؟ قالت: علي وأم أيمن. فقال عمر: (لا تقبل شهادة امرأة عجمية لا تفصح، وأما علي فيحوز النار إلى قرصه). فرجعت فاطمة عليها السلام وقد جرعها من الغيظ ما لا يوصف، فمرضت.</p>

And that no one from the enemies of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> should witness my<sup>-asws</sup> funeral, or my<sup>-asws</sup> burial, or Pray over me<sup>-asws</sup>’.</p>
<p>قال ابن عباس: وهو قول أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام: (أشياء لم أجد إلى تركهن سبيلا، لأن القرآن بها أنزل على قلب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله: قتال الناكثين والقاسطين والمارقين الذي أوصاني وعهد إلي خليلي رسول الله بقتالهم، وتزويج أمامة بنت زينب أوصتني بها فاطمة عليها السلام).</p>

<p>قال ابن عباس: فقبضت فاطمة عليها السلام من يومها، فارتجت المدينة بالبكاء من الرجال والنساء، ودهش الناس كيوم قبض فيه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فأقبل أبو بكر وعمر يعزيان عليا عليه السلام ويقولان له: (يا أبا الحسن، لا تسبقنا بالصلاة على ابنة رسول الله). فلما كان في الليل دعا علي عليه السلام العباس والفضل والمقداد وسلمان وأبا ذر وعمارا، فقدم العباس فصلى عليها ودفنوها.</p>
<p>Ibn Abbas said, ‘On the day in which Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> passed away, Al-Medina reverberated with the sounds of wailing from the men and the women, and the people were as shocked as they were on the day in which the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away.

<p>Umar said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> – O Clan of Hashim<sup>-as</sup> – you will not leave being envious to us, ever. If this is the grudge in your hearts, it will never go away.

<p>فقال علي عليه السلام: (والله لو رمت ذلك يا بن صهاك لأرجعت إليك يمينك. والله لئن سللت سيفي لا غمدته دون إزهاق نفسك، فرم ذلك). فانكسر عمر وسكت، وعلم أن عليا عليه السلام إذا حلف صدق. ثم قال علي عليه السلام: يا عمر، ألست الذي هم بك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وأرسل إلي، فجئت متقلدا بسيفي، ثم أقبلت نحوك لأقتلك، فأنزل الله عز وجل: (فلا تعجل عليهم إنما نعد لهم عدا)، فانصرفوا.</p>
<p>Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if you were to do that, O son of Sahaak, I<sup>-asws</sup> will return your pledge back to you. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, if I<sup>-asws</sup> unsheathe my<sup>-asws</sup> sword, I<sup>-asws</sup> will not sheathe it back until I cause you to die, so do that’. So Umar was broken and kept quiet, and he knew that if Ali<sup>-asws</sup> makes a vow, he<sup>-asws</sup> would always fulfil it.</p>
<p>Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O Umar, are you not the one whom the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> intended, and he<sup>-saww</sup> sent for me<sup>-asws</sup>, so I<sup>-asws</sup> came wearing my<sup>-asws</sup> sword, then I<sup>-asws</sup> came near you for killing you, so Allah <sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Revealed: <strong><em>“[19:84] Therefore be not in haste against them, We only number out to them a number (of days).”</em></strong>?

<p>Then Abu Bakr pondered over what he had ordered, for the killing of Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and realised that if he were to do that, a severe war would break out and a lengthy affliction, so he regretted what he had ordered for. He did not sleep in that night till the morning. Then he came to the Masjid and the Prayer had been called for. So he went forward to Pray with the people, thoughtful, not knowing what to say. And Khalid Bin Waleed came up wearing the sword until he stood by the side of Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and Ali<sup>-asws</sup> had discerned the situation by some of that. When Abu Bakr was free from bearing testimony (at the end of the Prayer), he shouted before sending the greetings, ‘O Khalid, do not do what I had ordered you to, for if you do it I will (have you) killed. Then he greeted from his right and from his left.</p>
<p><strong><u>المواجهة لمؤامرة القتل </u></strong></p>
<p>فوثب علي عليه السلام فأخذ بتلابيب خالد وانتزع السيف من يده، ثم صرعه وجلس على صدره وأخذ سيفه ليقتله، واجتمع عليه أهل المسجد ليخلصوا خالدا فما قدروا عليه. فقال العباس: حلفوه بحق القبر (لما كففت). فحلفوه بالقبر فتركه، وقام فانطلق إلى منزله.</p>

<p>So Ali<sup>-asws</sup> leapt and grabbed Khalid and wrestled the sword out from his hand, then made him fall and sat upon his chest, and took his sword out to kill him, and the people of the Masjid gathered against him<sup>-asws</sup> to free Khalid. They could not do it. Al-Abbas said, ‘Hold him<sup>-asws</sup> on oath by the right of the grave (of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>) to restrain him<sup>-asws</sup>. So they all held him<sup>-asws</sup> on oath by the grave (of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>), so he<sup>-asws</sup> left him, and stood up and went to his<sup>-asws</sup> home.</p>

<p>And Al-Zubayr, and Al-Abbas, and Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup>, and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and the Clan of Hashim<sup>-as</sup> came hailing unsheathed their swords and said, ‘By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, we will not finish here until he (Khalid Bin Waleed) speaks (as to who ordered him) and he does it’. The people differed, and there was commotion, and they became restless.</p>
<p>وخرجت نسوة بني هاشم فصرخن وقلن: (يا أعداء الله، ما أسرع ما أبديتم العداوة لرسول الله وأهل بيته لطالما أردتم هذا من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، فلم تقدروا عليه، فقتلتم ابنته بالأمس، ثم أنتم تريدون اليوم أن تقتلوا أخاه وابن عمه ووصيه وأبا ولده؟ كذبتم ورب الكعبة. ما كنتم تصلون إلى قتله). حتى تخوف الناس أن تقع فتنة عظيمة.</p>
<p>And the women of the Clan of Hashim<sup>-as</sup> came out screaming and said, ‘O enemies of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>! How quickly you have shown your enmity to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-saww</sup> Household. You often wanted this from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, but you did not have the power to do it.

<p>Surely Ali<sup>-asws</sup> has qualities for himself<sup>-asws</sup>, which will never be for anyone from the people. For example, he<sup>-asws</sup> is the owner of ‘Bara’at’ (Chapter 9 of the Quran), when the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘It will not be preached from me<sup>-saww</sup> except for a man<sup>-asws</sup> who is from me<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p>وقال صلى الله عليه وآله له يوم غزاة تبوك: (أنت مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى غير النبوة، فإنه لا نبي بعدي).</p>
<p>And he<sup>-saww</sup> said on the day of the (military) expedition of Tabuk: ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> are from me<sup>-saww</sup> of the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had from Musa<sup>-as</sup> apart from the Prophet-hood, so there is no Prophet<sup>-as</sup> to be after me<sup>-saww</sup>’.</p>
<p>وأمر صلى الله عليه وآله بسد كل باب شارع إلى المسجد غير بابه، فجهد عمر أن يرخص له في كوة صغيرة قدر عينه فأبى ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، وقال عند ذلك حمزة والعباس وجعفر: (سددت أبوابنا وتركت باب علي)؟ فقال صلى الله عليه وآله: (ما أنا سددتها ولا فتحت بابه، ولكن الله سدها وفتح بابه).</p>
<p>And he<sup>-saww</sup> ordered for the closure of every door leading to the Masjid apart from his<sup>-asws</sup> door. So Umar fought that he should be allowed to have a small niche the size of his eye. The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> refused that, and Hamza<sup>-as</sup>, and Al-Abbas<sup>-as</sup>, and Ja’far<sup>-as</sup> said regarding that, ‘You<sup>-saww</sup> are closing our<sup>-as</sup> doors and leaving his<sup>-asws</sup> door open?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘It was not I<sup>-saww</sup> that closed it, nor kept his<sup>-asws</sup> door open, but it was Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Who closed it and Kept his<sup>-asws</sup> door open’.</p>
<p>وآخى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بين كل رجلين من أصحابه، فقال عليه السلام له: آخيت بين كل رجلين من أصحابك وتركتني؟ فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (أنت أخي وأنا أخوك في الدنيا والآخرة).</p>
<p>And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> established brotherhood between every man from his<sup>-saww</sup> companions, so he<sup>-asws</sup> said to him<sup>-saww</sup>: ‘You<sup>-saww</sup> established brotherhood between every man from your<sup>-asws</sup> companions and have forsaken me<sup>-asws</sup>?’ So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> are my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>, and I<sup>-saww</sup> am your<sup>-asws</sup> brother in the world and the hereafter’.</p>

<p>And he<sup>-saww</sup> said on the Day of Khyber when Abu Bakr and Umar had been defeated, so the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> got angry and said: ‘What is wrong with the people that they meet the Polytheists, then flee? I<sup>-saww</sup> will give the Flag tomorrow to a man<sup>-asws</sup> who loves Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger, and is Loved by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>. He<sup>-asws</sup> is not a coward, and will not flee, and will not return until Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Grants victory of Khyber by his<sup>-asws</sup> hands’.</p>
<p>فلما أصبحنا اجتمعنا إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وأريت رسول الله وجهي فقال: (أين أخي، ادعوا لي عليا). فأتوه به، فإذا هو رمد يقاد من رمده وعليه إزار وغبار الدقيق عليه وكان يطحن لأهله.</p>
<p>When it was the morning, we gathered around the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> saw our faces, so he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Where is my<sup>-saww</sup> brother? Call Ali<sup>-asws</sup> for me<sup>-saww</sup>’. So they came with him<sup>-asws</sup>. He<sup>-asws</sup> had conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eye), and he<sup>-asws</sup> was being held due to his<sup>-asws</sup> conjunctivitis, and upon him<sup>-asws</sup> was the dust of the flour, and he<sup>-asws</sup> had been grinding the flour for his<sup>-asws</sup> Family<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>فأمره رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فوضع رأسه في حجره وتفل في عينيه. ثم عقد له ودعا له، فما انثنى حتى فتح الله له وأتاه بصفية بنت حيي بن أخطب، فأعتقها النبي صلى الله عليه وآله ثم تزوجها وجعل عتقها صداقها</p>
<p>So the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> ordered for his<sup>-asws</sup> head to be placed on his<sup>-saww</sup> lap, and he<sup>-saww</sup> applied his<sup>-saww</sup> saliva in his<sup>-asws</sup> eye. Then held him<sup>-asws</sup> and supplicated for him<sup>-asws</sup>. So he<sup>-asws</sup> did not turn back until Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Granted victory to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and Safiya Bin Hayya Bin Akhtab came to him<sup>-asws</sup>. So the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> freed her, then married her, and made her freedom to be her dowry.</p>

<p>And the words of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> to Umar – when he sought permission to kill Haatab Bin Abu Balta’at – so he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘And what do you intend, O Umar, perhaps Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Looked (Mercifully) to the group of the people of Badr, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Angels have borne witness that: “I<sup>-azwj</sup> have Forgiven them, so they (Momin) can do whatsoever they like (you (O Umar) better keep away from them)”.</p>
<p>وحديث جابر بن عبد الله الأنصاري: أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ذكر الموجبتين. قالوا: يا رسول الله، ما تعني بالموجبتين؟ قال: (من لقي الله لا يشرك به شيئا دخل الجنة، ومن لقيه يشرك به دخل النار).</p>
<p>And a Hadith of Jabir Bin Abdullah Al-Ansary that, ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> mentioned ‘Al-Mowjabatain’ (two necessities). So they (people) said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, what do you<sup>-saww</sup> mean by the ‘two necessities’?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘The one who meets Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> without having associated (Al-Shirk) anything to Him<sup>-azwj</sup> will enter the Paradise, and the one who meets Him<sup>-azwj</sup> having associated (Al-Shirk) to Him<sup>-azwj</sup> will enter the Fire’.</p>
<p>فلست أرجو لأبي بكر وعمر وعثمان وطلحة والزبير النجاة إلا بهذه الروايات والسلامة. قلت: أتجعل حدث أبي بكر وعمر مثل حدث عثمان وطلحة والزبير، إن كان الأمر لعلي عليه السلام دونهم من الله ورسوله؟ فقال: يا أحمق، لا تقولن (إن كان) هو والله لعلي دونهم، وكيف لا يكون له دونهم بعد الخصال الأربع؟ ولقد حدثني عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله الثقات ما لا أحصي.</p>
<p>So I am not hopeful for the salvation and safety of Abu Bakr, and Umar, and Usman, and Talha, and Al-Zubayr except by this report’. I said, ‘Are you considering the events of Abu Bakr and Umar to be similar to the events of Usman, and Talha, and Al-Zubayr, if the command (Caliphate) was for Ali<sup>-asws</sup> from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and from His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>, apart from them?’ He said, ‘You fool, do not say ‘If’. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> it is definitely for Ali<sup>-asws</sup> apart from them, and how can it not be so after four specialities? And these have been narrated to me from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> by countless reliable narrators’.</p>
<p>قلت: وما هذه الخصال الأربع؟ قال: قول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ونصبه إياه يوم غدير خم. وقوله في غزوة تبوك: (أنت مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى غير النبوة)، ولو كان غير النبوة لاستثناه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، وقد علمنا يقينا أن الخلافة غير النبوة.</p>
<p>I said, ‘And what are these four qualities?’ He said, ‘The words of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and nominating him<sup>-asws</sup> on the Day of Ghadeer Khumm. And his<sup>-saww</sup> words during the (military) expedition of Tabbuk; ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> are from me<sup>-saww</sup> of the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had from Musa<sup>-as</sup>, apart from the Prophet-hood’, and had it been something other than the Prophet-hood, the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> would have made an exception for that as well, and we know with conviction that the Caliphate is other than the Prophet-hood.</p>
<p>وخطب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله آخر خطبة خطبها للناس ثم دخل بيته فلم يخرج حتى قبضه الله إليه: (أيها الناس، إني قد تركت فيكم أمرين لن تضلوا ما تمسكتم بهما: كتاب الله وأهل بيتي، فإن اللطيف الخبير قد عهد إلي أنهما لن يفترقا حتى يردا علي الحوض كهاتين – وجمع بين سبابتيه – لا كهاتين – وجمع بين سبابته والوسطى – لأن إحديهما قدام الأخرى فتمسكوا بهما لا تضلوا ولا تولوا. لا تقدموهم فتهلكوا، ولا تعلموهم فإنهم أعلم منكم.</p>
<p>And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> preached in the last sermon of his<sup>-saww</sup> sermons to the people, then entered his<sup>-saww</sup> house, so he<sup>-saww</sup> did not return until Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Captured him<sup>-saww</sup> (Passed away): ‘O you people! I<sup>-saww</sup> have left among you all two commands. You will not stray if you attach yourselves to these two – the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household, for the Kind<sup>-azwj</sup>, the Aware<sup>-azwj</sup> has Promised me<sup>-saww</sup> that these two will never separate until they return to the Fountain just like these two’ – and he<sup>-saww</sup> gathered his<sup>-saww</sup> two index fingers of the two hands together – ‘not like this’ – and he<sup>-saww</sup> joined his<sup>-saww</sup> middle finger and his<sup>-saww</sup> index finger (of the same hand) together – ‘because one of them precedes the other. So attach yourselves to these two and you will not stray and you will not turn around. Do not precede them for you will perish by it, and do not (try to) teach them for they<sup>-asws</sup> are more knowledgeable than you all’.</p>
<p>ولقد أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أبا بكر وعمر – وهما سابعا سبعة – أن يسلموا على علي عليه السلام بإمرة المؤمنين. ولعمري لئن جاز لنا – يا أخا عبد القيس – أن نستغفر لعثمان وطلحة والزبير – وقد بلغ من حدثهم ما قد ظهر لنا – إنه ليسعنا أن نستغفر لهما.</p>
<p>And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had ordered Abu Bakr and Umar – and they were the seventh of the seven – to greet Ali<sup>-asws</sup> as ‘Amir-ul-Momineen’. And by my life, although it is permissible for us – O brother of Abdul Qays – that we can seek forgiveness of Usman, and Talha and Al-Zubayr – and it has reached from their innovations what is apparent to us – these (innovations) do not give us the leeway that we should seek forgiveness for them.</p>
<p>فأما طلحة والزبير، فإنهما بايعا عليا عليه السلام – وأنا شاهد – طائعين غير مكرهين. ثم نكثا بيعتهما وسفكا الدماء التي قد حرم الله رغبة في الدنيا وحرصا على الملك، وليس ذنب بعد الشرك بالله أعظم من سفك الدماء التي حرم الله.</p>
<p>And as for Talha and Al-Zubayr, these two pledged their allegiances to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> – and I was present – willingly, without abhorrence. Then they broke their allegiances and shed the blood which Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Forbidden to shed in their desire for the world and their greed for the kingdom, and there is no sin after the association (Al-Shirk) with Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> which is greater than the shedding of the blood which Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Forbidden to be shed.</p>
<p>وأما عثمان فأدنى السفهاء وباعد الأتقياء وآوى طريد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسير أولياء الله أبا ذر وقوما صالحين وجعل المال دولة بين الأغنياء وحكم بغير ما أنزل الله، وكانت أحداثه أكثر وأعظم من أن تحصى، وأعظمهما تحريق كتاب الله، وأفظعها صلاته بمنى أربعا خلافا على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p>And as for Usman, he brought the fools closer to himself and kept the pious ones away, and harboured the ones whom the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had expelled whereas he exiled the friend of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> and a group of upright people, and made the wealth of the state to be distributed between the rich, and gave judgements apart from what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Sent down, and his innovations are more numerous and greater than what can be numbered. And the greatest of them was the burning of the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and a more flagrant (violation) was his Prayer at Mina of four ‘Rakaat’ (Cycles), in opposition to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>’ (two Rakaat).</p>
<p>قلت: أصلحك الله، فترحمك عليه وتفضيلك إياه؟ قال: إنما أصنع ذلك ليسمع بذلك أوليائه الطغاة العتاة الجبابرة الظلمة، الحجاج وابن زياد قبله وأبوه. أما علمت أنهم من اتهموه في بغض عثمان وحب علي عليه السلام وأهل بيته نفوه ومثلوا به وقتلوه؟ وقد قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (ليس للمؤمن أن يذل نفسه). قلت: وما إذلاله لنفسه؟ قال: يتعرض من البلاء لما لا يقوى عليه ولا يقوم به.</p>
<p>I said (to Hassan Basry), ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Keep you well, you are being merciful towards him (Usman) and giving him preferences over him<sup>-asws</sup> (Ali<sup>-asws</sup>)?’ He said, ‘But I am doing that due to his (Usman’s) friends, the tyrants, the hardened compellers of injustices – Al-Hajjaj and Ibn Ziyad, and before him, his father.</p>
<p>But are you aware that they are accusing (people) for harbouring hatred towards Usman and loving Ali<sup>-asws</sup> and the People<sup>-asws</sup> of his<sup>-asws</sup> Household, and they would expel him, and cut-off his limbs and kill him? And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> has said: ‘It is not for a Believer to disgrace himself’. I said, ‘And how does he (a Believer) disgrace himself?’ He said, ‘By presenting himself in an affliction against which he does not have the strength for, nor is he able to withstand it.</p>
<p>وقد سمعت عليا عليه السلام يروي عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يوم قتل عثمان وهو يقول: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: (إن التقية من دين الله، ولا دين لمن لا تقية له. والله لولا التقية ما عبد الله في الأرض في دولة إبليس). فقال له رجل: وما دولة إبليس؟ قال عليه السلام: (إذا ولى الناس إمام ضلالة فهي دولة إبليس على آدم، وإذا وليهم إمام هدى فهي دولة آدم على إبليس).</p>
<p>And I have heard Ali<sup>-asws</sup> reporting from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> on the day in which Usman was killed, and he<sup>-asws</sup> was saying: ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Surely, the ‘Taqeeya’ (dissimulation) is from the Religion of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and there is no Religion for the one who has no ‘Taqeeya’ (dissimulation) with him’. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, had it not been for ‘Taqeeya’, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> would not have been worshipped in the earth during the governance of Iblees<sup>-la</sup>’. So a man said to him<sup>-asws</sup>: ‘And what is the governance of Iblees<sup>-la</sup>?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said; ‘When the people are governed by an imam of misguidance, so this is the governance of Iblees<sup>-la</sup> over Adam<sup>-as</sup>, and when their governor is an Imam<sup>-asws</sup> of guidance, so this is the governance of Adam<sup>-as</sup> over Iblees<sup>-la</sup>’.</p>
<p>ثم همس إلى عمار ومحمد بن أبي بكر همسة وأنا أسمع، فقال: (ما زلتم منذ قبض نبيكم في دولة إبليس بترككم إياي واتباعكم غيري).</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> whispered to Amaar and Muhammad Bin Abu Bakr with a whispering and I heard him<sup>-asws</sup> say: ‘You all have never ceased, since the passing away of your Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, to be in the governance of Iblees<sup>-la</sup> by avoiding me<sup>-asws</sup> and following others’.</p>
<p><strong><u>كيف بايع الناس عليا عليه السلام بعد قتل عثمان </u></strong></p>
<p>ثم هرب من الناس ثلاثة أيام، فطلبوه فأتوه في خص لبني النجار فقالوا: إنا قد تشاورنا في هذا الأمر ثلاثة أيام فما وجدنا أحدا من الناس أحق بها منك، فننشدك الله في أمة محمد صلى الله عليه وآله أن تضيع وأن يلي أمرها غيرك. فبايعوه وكان أول من بايعه طلحة والزبير، ثم جاءا إلى البصرة يزعمان أنهما بايعا مكرهين، وكذبا.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-people-pledged-their-allegiance-to-ali-asws-after-the-killing-of-usman" class="joli-heading jtoc-heading font-headlines"><a name="_Toc338413256"></a><a name="_Toc341095744"></a>How the people pledged their allegiance to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> after the killing of Usman</h2>
<p>Then he<sup>-asws</sup> kept himself<sup>-asws</sup> away from the people for three days, so they started looking for him<sup>-asws</sup>. They came up to him<sup>-asws</sup> in being in solitude among the Clan of Najaar. So they said, ‘We have held consultations with regards to this command (Caliphate) for three days, and we did not find anyone from the people more deserving of it than you<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>We adjure you<sup>-asws</sup> to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> regarding the community of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> that it would be lost if it were to follow someone other than you<sup>-asws</sup> for its affairs’. So they pledged allegiance to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and the first ones to pledge allegiance to him<sup>-asws</sup> were Talha and Al-Zubayr, then they went to ‘Al-Basra’ alleging that they had both pledged their allegiance unwillingly, but they had lied.</p>
<p>ثم أتاه رجل من مهرة – ومحمد بن أبي بكر بجنبه – فقال له علي عليه السلام – وأنا أسمع -: يا أخا مهرة، أجئت لتبايع؟ قال: نعم. قال: تبايعني على أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قبض والأمر لي، فانتزى علينا ابن أبي قحافة ظلما وعدوانا. ثم انتزى علينا بعده عمر؟ قال: نعم. فبايعه على ذلك طائعا غير مكره.</p>
<p>Then a man from ‘<em>Mahrat’</em> came up – and Muhammad Bin Abu Bakr was by his<sup>-asws</sup> side – and I was listening. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘O brother from <em>Mahrat</em>, have you come to pledge allegiance?’ He said, ‘Yes’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Will you be pledging allegiance based upon the fact that the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> passed away and the command was for me<sup>-asws</sup>, so the son of Abu Kohafa (Abu Bakr) snatched it from us<sup>-asws</sup> unjustly and out of enmity. Then Umar snatched it from us after him?’ He said, ‘Yes’. So he pledged his allegiance upon that (condition), willingly, without abhorrence (this was the ‘bayt’<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a> condition of a Momin).</p>
<p>قال: فقلت للحسن: أفبايع الناس كلهم على هذا؟ قال: لا، إنما بايع من أمن ووثق به على هذا. يا أخا عبد القيس، ولئن جاز لنا أن نستغفر لعثمان وقد ركب ما ركب من الكبائر والأمور القبيحة، إنه ليجوز لنا أن نستغفر لهما وقد عوفيا من الدماء وعفا في ولايتهما وكفا وأحسنا السيرة، ولم يعملا بمثل عمل عثمان من الجور والتخليط، ولا بمثل ما عمله طلحة والزبير من نكثهما البيعة وما سفكا من الدماء إرادة الدنيا والملك، وقد سمعا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ينهى عما ركبا وعما أتيا فتركا أمر الله وأمر رسوله بعد الحجة والبينة استخفافا بأمر الله وأمر رسوله.</p>
<p>I said to Al-Hassan (Basry), ‘Did all of the people pledge their allegiances upon that?’ He said, ‘No, but rather it was for the trustworthy ones who pledged their allegiances upon this.</p>
<p>O brother of Abdul Qays, and had it been permissible for us to seek Forgiveness for Usman, and he had committed what he committed from the major sins and ugly matters, if would have been permissible for us to seek Forgiveness for the both of them (Abu Bakr and Umar) for they had refrained from (shedding) the blood, and were tolerant during their rule, and withheld their hands, and were of good ways (Seerah), and their actions were not similar to the actions of Usman from the oppression and the confusion, and not similar to the actions of Talha and Al-Zubayr from the breaking of the allegiance and the blood which they shed in their desires of the world and the kingdom, and they had heard from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> forbidding from what they had done and what they had come up with, so they avoided the Order of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the order of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup> after the arguments and clear proof. They belittled the Order of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the order of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>ولئن قلت يا أخا عبد القيس: (إن أبا بكر وعمر قد سمعا ما قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في علي عليه السلام)، فلقد سمع ذلك عثمان وطلحة والزبير ثم ركبوا ما ركبوا من الحرب وسفك الدماء وعوفيا من ذلك</p>
<p>O brother of Abdul Qays, surely, Abu Bakr and Umar had heard what the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had said regarding Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, and so did Usman, and Talha and Al-Zubayr, then they did what they did from the battles and the shedding of the blood, and were excused from that.</p>
<p><strong><u>أبو بكر وعمر أول من أسس الضلالة في الأمة </u></strong></p>
<p>ولئن قلت: (إنهما أول من فتح ذلك وسنه وأدخلا الفتنة والبلاء على الأمة بانتزائهما على ما قد علما يقينا أنه لا حق لهما فيه وأن الله جعله لغيرهما، وأنهما سلما على علي عليه السلام بإمرة المؤمنين، ثم قالا للنبي صلى الله عليه وآله حين أمرهما بالتسليم عليه: أمن الله ومن رسوله؟ قال: نعم، من الله ومن رسوله)، إن في ذلك لمقالا. لقد قال لي أبو ذر – حين حدثني بتسليمهما على علي عليه السلام بإمرة المؤمنين، هو والمقداد وسلمان -: سمعنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: (ما ولت أمة قط أمرها رجلا وفيهم من هو أعلم منه إلا لم يزل أمرهم يذهب سفالا حتى يرجعوا إلى ما تركوا).</p>

<p>And if you were to say, ‘These two (Abu Bakr and Umar) were the first ones to open that, and made the way for the strife (Al-Fitna) and the affliction to come up upon the community by their snatching away (the Caliphate).&nbsp; And they knew for certain that there was no right for the both of them in it and that Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Made it to be for someone<sup>-asws</sup> other than the two of them, and they had both greeted Ali<sup>-asws</sup> as ‘Amir-ul-Momineen’, then they said to the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> when he<sup>-saww</sup> ordered them both for the greeting, ‘Is this from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and from His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>?’</p>
<p>He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Yes, from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and from His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>’, and in that is a statement. Abu Dharr<sup>-ra</sup> had said to me – when he<sup>-ra</sup> narrated to me of their<sup>-ra</sup> greeting to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> as ‘Amir-ul-Momineen’ by him<sup>-ra</sup> and Al-Miqdad<sup>-ra</sup>, and Salman<sup>-ra</sup> -, ‘We<sup>-ra</sup> heard the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> say: ‘A community will not elect at all, a man (ruler) for its affairs whilst there is a more knowledgeable one, is present, among them, except that it will not cease to decline lower in their affairs until they revert back to that which they had avoided’.</p>
<p><strong><u>اعتراف جميع الصحابة بخلافة علي عليه السلام بعد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله </u></strong></p>
<p>يا أخا عبد القيس، إن أبا بكر وعمر وعثمان وطلحة والزبير وجميع أصحاب النبي صلى الله عليه وآله لم يكونوا يشكون ولا يختلفون ولا يتنازعون بينهم أن علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام كان أولهم إسلاما وأكثرهم علما وأعظمهم عناء في الجهاد في سبيل الله ومبارزة الأقران ووقايته لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بنفسه.</p>

<p>O brother of Abdul Qays, surely Abu Bakr, and Umar, and Usman, and Talha, and Al-Zubayr, and all the companions of the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> did not end up doubting, and were not differing, and were not disputing between themselves that Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> was the foremost of them in Islam, and more knowledgeable than them, and greater than them in the struggle (Jihaad) in the way of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and in duelling against the warriors, and placing his<sup>-asws</sup> own self for (protecting) the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> (in dangers).</p>
<p>وأنه لم ينزل برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله شديدة ولا كربة ولا مبارزة قرن وفتح حصن إلا قدمه فيها ثقة به ومعرفة بفضله وأنه أعلمهم بكتاب الله وسنة نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله وأنه أحبهم إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وأنه وصي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p>And there did not descend upon the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> any severity, nor a plight, nor any duel and conquering of a fort except that he<sup>-asws</sup> was placed forward with regards to it, relying upon him<sup>-asws</sup>, and recognised his<sup>-asws</sup> virtues, and that he<sup>-asws</sup> was more knowledgeable than them of the Book of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and the Sunnah of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> was more Beloved to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and that he<sup>-asws</sup> was the successor<sup>-asws</sup> of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>وأنه قد كان له كل يوم وكل ليلة من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله خلوة ودخلة إليه، إذا سأله أعطاه وإذا سكت ابتدأه. وأنه لم يحتج إلى أحد بعد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في علم ولا فقه، وأن جميعهم كانوا يحتاجون إليه وهو لا يحتاج إلى أحد.</p>
<p>And it was for him<sup>-asws</sup> to be alone with the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> every day and night and to come up to him<sup>-saww</sup>. If he<sup>-asws</sup> asked, he<sup>-saww</sup> would answer, and if he<sup>-asws</sup> remained silent, he<sup>-saww</sup> would initiate (discussion). And he<sup>-asws</sup> was not needy of anyone, after the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> in knowledge and in understanding, and all of them were needy to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and he<sup>-asws</sup> not needy to anyone.</p>
<p>وأن له من السوابق والمناقب وما أنزل فيه من القرآن ما ليس لأحد منهم، وأنه كان أجودهم كفا وأسخاهم نفسا وأشجعهم لقاء. وما خصلة من خصال الخير له فيها نظير ولا شبيه ولا كفو، في زهده في الدنيا ولا في اجتهاده. فمما خصه الله به أن أخذ على الناس بالفصل الأول مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، فلم يسبقه أحد منهم إلى خير، ولم يؤمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أحدا قط عليه ولم يتقدم أمامه أحد في صلاة قط.</p>
<p>And that for him<sup>-asws</sup> are, from the precedence and the merits and what was Revealed regarding him<sup>-asws</sup> from the Quran, which are not for anyone among them, and that he<sup>-asws</sup> was more generous than them, more self-sacrificial than them, and braver than them in meeting (then enemy). And there was not an opponent, or a similar one, or an equal in what qualities he<sup>-asws</sup> had from the good qualities for him<sup>-asws</sup>, in his<sup>-asws</sup> ascetism in the world, nor in his struggles. From what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Specialised him<sup>-asws</sup> by him<sup>-asws</sup> having first priority with the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. No one preceded him<sup>-asws</sup> to the good (deeds), and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> never ordered anyone over him<sup>-asws</sup> at all, and no one led him<sup>-asws</sup> in Prayers, at all.</p>
<p><strong><u>الجواب عن قضية صلاة أبي بكر عند وفاة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله </u></strong></p>

<p>Abaan said, ‘I said, ‘O Abu Saeed, did not the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> order Abu Bakr that he should (lead) the people in Prayer?’ He said, ‘Where are you going, O Abaan? Surely, Ali<sup>-asws</sup> was not with the people whom Abu Bakr had been ordered to Pray with, but rather, he<sup>-asws</sup> was with the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> comforting him<sup>-saww</sup> in his<sup>-saww</sup> illness, and he<sup>-saww</sup> was bequeathing to him<sup>-asws</sup>, and Praying with him<sup>-asws</sup>. And also Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> did not let Abu Bakr lead the Salat but Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> came out, moved Abu Bakr behind, and Prayed with the people (similar to the preaching of the Verse of Barat).</p>
<p>والله لقد سمعت عليا عليه السلام يقول: فتح لي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في مرضه مفتاح ألف باب من العلم، كل باب يفتح ألف باب. ثم أخذ بالفصل الآخر أن صبر على الظلم، فلما وجد أعوانا قاتل على تأويل القرآن كما قاتل على تنزيله، فأمر بالمعروف ونهى عن المنكر وجاهد في سبيل الله حتى استشهد، فلقي الله نقيا زكيا سعيدا شهيدا طيبا مطيبا قد قاتل الذين أمره الله ورسوله بقتالهم: الناكثين والقاسطين والمارقين.</p>
<p>By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, I have heard Ali<sup>-asws</sup> say: ‘The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> opened for me<sup>-asws</sup>, during his<sup>-saww</sup> illness, a key to a thousand doors from knowledge, each door opening to another thousand doors. Then he<sup>-asws</sup> took on (another merit) that he<sup>-asws</sup> had to observe patience in oppression, and if he<sup>-asws</sup> were to find helpers then he<sup>-asws</sup> should fight for the explanation of the Quran just as he<sup>-asws</sup> fought over its Revelation.</p>
<p>So he<sup>-asws</sup> ordered the enjoining of the good and the forbidding of the evil, and fought in the way of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> until he<sup>-asws</sup> was martyred. So he<sup>-asws</sup> met Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> as pure, clean, happy, martyr, good, in goodness, for he<sup>-asws</sup> had fought against those whom the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had ordered to fight against – The breakers (of the Covenant), the renegades, and the deviants’.</p>

<p>وذكر سليم بن قيس: أن عليا عليه السلام كان إذا لقي عدوا يوم الجمل ويوم صفين ويوم النهروان استقبل القبلة على بغلته الشهباء بغلة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، ثم قال: (اللهم بسطت إليك الأيدي ورفعت الأبصار وأفضت القلوب ونقلت الأقدام. ربنا افتح بيننا وبين قومنا بالحق وأنت خير الفاتحين)، وهو رافع يديه وأصحابه يؤمنون.</p>
<p>And Sulaym Bin Qays mentioned that, ‘Ali<sup>-asws</sup>, when he<sup>-asws</sup> met the enemies on the Day of Al-Jamal, and the Day of Siffeen, and the Day of Al-Nahrwaan, turned towards the Qiblah upon his<sup>-asws</sup> grey mule which was the mule similar to that of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, then said: ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>! The hands are extended towards You<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the eyes are raised, and the hearts are opened up, and the feet have stepped ahead. Our Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>! Grant victory to us and to our people by the truth, and You<sup>-azwj</sup> are the best in Granting victory’, and he<sup>-asws</sup> had his<sup>-asws</sup> hands raised, and his<sup>-asws</sup> companions responded by saying ‘Ameen’.</p>

<p>سليم قال: جاء رجل إلى علي بن أبي طالب وأنا أسمع، فقال: أخبرني يا أمير المؤمنين بأفضل منقبة لك؟ قال: ما أنزل الله في من كتابه. قال: وما أنزل الله فيك؟ قال: قوله: (أفمن كان على بينة من ربه ويتلوه شاهد منه)، أنا الشاهد من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. وقوله: (ومن عنده علم الكتاب)، إياي عنى. ولم يدع شيئا مما ذكر الله فيه إلا ذكره.</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘A man came up to Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup>, and I was listening, so he said, ‘Inform me, O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, of the highest merit for you’. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘What Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Revealed regarding me<sup>-asws</sup> from His<sup>-azwj</sup> book’.</p>
<p>He asked, ‘And what has Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Revealed regarding you<sup>-asws</sup>?’</p>
<p>Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘His<sup>-azwj</sup> Statement: <strong><em>“[11:17] Is he then who has with him clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him”</em></strong>, I<sup>-asws</sup> am the Witness from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. And His<sup>-azwj</sup> Statement: <strong><em>“[13:43] and the one who has knowledge of the Book”</em></strong>, it means me<sup>-asws</sup>’.

<p><strong><u>أفضل منقبة له عليه السلام من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله </u></strong></p>

<p>He said, ‘So inform me of the highest merit for you<sup>-asws</sup> from the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘He<sup>-saww</sup> nominated me<sup>-asws</sup> at Ghadeer Khumm, so he<sup>-saww</sup> established for me<sup>-asws</sup> the ‘Wilayah’ from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic by the Order of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Blessed and High. And his<sup>-saww</sup> statement: ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> are from me<sup>-saww</sup> of the status which Haroun<sup>-as</sup> had with Musa<sup>-as</sup>’.</p>
<p>وسافرت مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله – وذلك قبل أن يأمر نسائه بالحجاب – وأنا أخدم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ليس له خادم غيري. وكان لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لحاف ليس له لحاف غيره ومعه عائشة، وكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ينام بيني وبين عائشة ليس علينا ثلاثة لحاف غيره.</p>
<p>I<sup>-asws</sup> was travelling with the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> – and that was before he<sup>-saww</sup> had ordered his<sup>-saww</sup> wives for the veiling – and I<sup>-asws</sup> was attending to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, there was no attendant for him<sup>-saww</sup> apart from myself<sup>-asws</sup>. And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had a quilt, and there was no other quilt for him<sup>-saww</sup> apart from it, and with him<sup>-saww</sup> was Ayesha, and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> slept in between myself<sup>-asws</sup> and Ayesha. There was no quilt for the three of us other than it.</p>
<p>وإذا قام رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يصلي حط بيده اللحاف من وسطه بيني وبين عائشة ليمس اللحاف الفراش الذي تحتنا ويقوم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فيصلي.</p>
<p>And when the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> stood up to Pray, he<sup>-saww</sup> put down the quilt by his<sup>-saww</sup> hand from his<sup>-saww</sup> waist, between me<sup>-asws</sup> and Ayesha, so that the quilt touched the ground which was underneath us, and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> stood up, so he<sup>-saww</sup> Prayed.</p>
<p>فأخذتني الحمي ليلة فأسهرتني، فسهر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لسهري. فبات ليلته بيني وبين مصلاه يصلي ما قدر له. ثم يأتيني فيسألني وينظر إلي. فلم يزل دأبه ذلك إلى أن أصبح.</p>
<p>I<sup>-asws</sup> was overtaken by fever, which kept me<sup>-asws</sup> awake at night, so the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> stayed awake with me<sup>-asws</sup>. He<sup>-saww</sup> spent his<sup>-saww</sup> night in between (looking after) me<sup>-asws</sup> and his Prayer. He<sup>-saww</sup> Prayed what he<sup>-saww</sup> could manage. Then he<sup>-saww</sup> came to me<sup>-asws</sup>, and would ask me<sup>-asws</sup> (about my<sup>-asws</sup> well being) and looked after me<sup>-asws</sup>. He<sup>-saww</sup> did not cease that diligence of his<sup>-saww</sup> until the morning.</p>
<p>فلما أصبح صلى بأصحابه الغداة ثم قال: (اللهم اشف عليا وعافه فإنه قد أسهرني الليلة لما به من الوجع)، فكأنما نشطت من عقال ما بي قبله.</p>
<p>When Dawn broke, he<sup>-saww</sup> Prayed the Dawn Prayer with his<sup>-saww</sup> companions, then said; ‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>! Give Ali<sup>-asws</sup> good health, for I<sup>-saww</sup> have stayed awake due to his<sup>-asws</sup> pain’. I<sup>-asws</sup> was cured and became more active than before it’.</p>
<p>قال عليه السلام: ثم قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: أبشر يا أخي – قال ذلك وأصحابه يسمعون – قلت: بشرك الله بخير يا رسول الله وجعلني فداؤك. قال: إني لم أسأل الله شيئا إلا أعطانيه، ولم أسأل لنفسي شيئا إلا سألت لك مثله، وإني دعوت الله أن يواخي بيني وبينك ففعل، وسألته (أن يجعلك ولي كل مؤمن من بعدي) ففعل.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Then the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘Receive good news, O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother<sup>-asws</sup>’ – He<sup>-saww</sup> said that and his<sup>-saww</sup> companions were listening – I<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘May Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Give you<sup>-saww</sup> better news and Make me<sup>-asws</sup> to be sacrificed for you<sup>-asws</sup>’. He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘I<sup>-saww</sup> did not ask Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for anything, but He<sup>-azwj</sup> Gave it to me<sup>-saww</sup>, and I<sup>-saww</sup> did not ask anything for myself<sup>-saww</sup> except that I<sup>-saww</sup> asked for you<sup>-asws</sup> the like of it. And I<sup>-saww</sup> asked Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> to Establish brotherhood between myself<sup>-saww</sup> and you<sup>-asws</sup>, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Did it, and I<sup>-saww</sup> asked Him<sup>-azwj</sup> to make you<sup>-asws</sup> to be the Guardian for every believer after me<sup>-saww</sup>, so He<sup>-azwj</sup> Did it’.</p>
<p>فقال رجلان – أحدهما لصاحبه -: وما أراد إلى ما سأل؟ فوالله لصاع من تمر بال في شن بال خير مما سأل ولو كان سأل ربه أن ينزل عليه ملكا يعينه على عدوه أو ينزل عليه كنزا ينفقه على أصحابه – فإن بهم حاجة – كان خيرا مما سأل. وما دعا عليا قط إلى حق ولا إلى باطل إلا أجابه.</p>
<p>So two men said – one of them to his companion -, ‘And he<sup>-saww</sup> did not ask what he<sup>-saww</sup> needed to. For, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, a Sa’a of rotton dates would have been better than what he<sup>-saww</sup> had asked for. And had he<sup>-saww</sup> asked his<sup>-saww</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> to Send down Angels to help him<sup>-saww</sup> against his<sup>-saww</sup> enemies, or Send down for him<sup>-saww</sup> a treasure to spend on his<sup>-saww</sup> companions – for this is what is needed – it would have been better than what he<sup>-saww</sup> had asked for. And Ali<sup>-asws</sup> always ratifies what he<sup>-saww</sup> says, be it true or false (nouzobilla), although he<sup>-asws</sup> did not know what was supplicated’.</p>
<p>Two men said – one of them of its friend – : and what wanted to what asked ? Fouallh of a measure from mind dates in launching a good mind from what asked and if he asked his Lord to reveal to him a property that helps him in his enemy or descends on him a treasure he spends him on his friends -, there is by them a need – he was good from what asked .And what called on a higher at all for a right or for a false except he answered him</p>

<p>سليم: قال: قلت لعبد الله بن العباس – وجابر بن عبد الله الأنصاري إلى جنبه -: شهدت النبي صلى الله عليه وآله عند موته؟ قال: نعم، لما ثقل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله جمع كل محتلم من بني عبد المطلب وامرأة وصبي قد عقل، فجمعهم جميعا فلم يدخل معهم غيرهم إلا الزبير فإنما أدخله لمكان صفية، وعمر بن أبي سلمة وأسامة بن زيد.</p>
<p>Sulaym said, ‘I said to Abdullah Bin Al-Abbas – and Jabir Bin Abdullah Bin Al-Ansary was by his side -, ‘Did you see the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> at the time of his<sup>-saww</sup> passing away?’ He said, ‘Yes, when the (condition) of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> worsened, he<sup>-saww</sup> gathered every grown up from the Clan of Abdul Muttalib, and women and boys of understanding age. So he<sup>-saww</sup> gathered all of them, and no one was included among them except for Al-Zubayr who he had been included in the place of Safiyya, as well as (included) Umar Ibn Abu Salma, and Asama Bin Zayd.</p>
<p>ثم قال: (إن هؤلاء الثلاثة منا أهل البيت)، وقال: (أسامة مولانا ومنا). وقد كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله استعمله على جيش وعقد له وفي ذلك الجيش أبو بكر وعمر، فقال كل واحد منهما: (لا ينتهي يستعمل علينا هذا الصبي العبد)</p>
<p>Then he<sup>-saww</sup> said that: ‘These three are from us<sup>-asws</sup> the People<sup>-asws</sup> of the Household’, and said: ‘Asama is our<sup>-asws</sup> slave and from us<sup>-asws</sup>’. And the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had placed him in charge of the army, and contracted for it, and in that army were Abu Bakr and Umar, so each one of the two said, ‘We do not agree that this young slave should be in charge over us’.</p>
<p>فاستأذن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ليودعه ويسلم عليه، فوافق ذلك اجتماع بني هاشم فدخل معهم واستأذن أبو بكر وعمر أسامة ليسلما على النبي صلى الله عليه وآله فأذن لهما. فلما دخل أسامة معنا – وهو من أوسط بني هاشم وكان صلى الله عليه وآله شديد الحب له – قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لنسائه: (قمن عني فأخلينني وأهل بيتي). فقمن كلهن غير عائشة وحفصة فنظر إليهما رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وقال: (اخلياني وأهل بيتي). فقامت عائشة آخذة بيد حفصة وهي تدمر غضبا وتقول: (قد أخليناك وإياهم) فدخلتا بيتا من خشب.</p>
<p>The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> granted permission (to Asama) to bid his farewell and greet him<sup>-saww</sup>. That took place during the gathering of the Clan of Hashim, so he entered along with them, and Abu Bakr and Umar sought permission from Asama for greeting the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, so he gave permission to them both.&nbsp; When Asama entered along with us – and he was in the middle of the Clan of Hashim, and the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> was gripped by high fever – the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said to his<sup>-saww</sup> wives: ‘Arise from me<sup>-saww</sup> and leave me<sup>-saww</sup> to be along with the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household’. All of them stood up apart from Ayesha and Hafsa. The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> looked at them and said: ‘Leave me<sup>-as</sup> alone with the People<sup>-asws</sup> of my<sup>-saww</sup> Household!’ So Ayesha stood up, and took the hand of Hafsa and exclaimed in outrage, ‘So we remove ourselves from you<sup>-saww</sup> and them<sup>-asws</sup>!’ They both entered the wooden house.</p>

<p>The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> said to Ali<sup>-asws</sup>: ‘O my<sup>-saww</sup> brother, (help) me sit-up’. So Ali<sup>-asws</sup> sat him<sup>-saww</sup> up, and gave support to his<sup>-saww</sup> neck. He<sup>-saww</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, then said: ‘O sons of Abdul Muttalib<sup>-as</sup>, fear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and worship Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[3:103] And hold fast, all together, by the rope which Allah (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves”</em></strong> and do not differ. Surely, Al-Islam is based upon five – upon ‘Wilayah’, and the Prayer, and the Zakat, and the Fating in the Month of Ramadhan, and the Pilgrimage. So as for the ‘Wilayah’, it is for Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger<sup>-saww</sup>, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[5:55] and those who believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow”</em></strong>, <strong><em>“[5:56] And whoever takes Allah and His messenger and those who believe for a guardian, then surely the party of Allah are they that shall be triumphant”</em></strong>’.</p>

Salman<sup>-ra</sup> said, ‘O Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, is it for the general Believers or exclusively for some of them?’ He<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘But exclusively for some of them, those<sup>-asws</sup> whom Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Joined them<sup>-asws</sup> with Himself<sup>-azwj</sup>, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> in another Verse from the Quran’.</p>

<p>(Sulaym) said, ‘Then the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> turned towards Ibn Abbas, so he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘But the beginning of the destruction of the Clan of Umayya – after ten of them have ruled – will be by the hand of your sons. So fear Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and look after my<sup>-saww</sup> sons<sup>-asws</sup> and my<sup>-saww</sup> Family, for the world did not remain for anyone before us<sup>-asws</sup>, and will not remain for anyone after us<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>

<p>At the time of his<sup>-saww</sup> passing away, the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> held my<sup>-asws</sup> hand, so he<sup>-saww</sup> opened for me<sup>-asws</sup> a thousand doors from the knowledge, each door opening a (further) thousand doors – and Abu Bakr and Umar were both looking at me<sup>-asws</sup> – and he<sup>-saww</sup> was indicating that. When I<sup>-asws</sup> went out, they said to me<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘What did he<sup>-saww</sup> say to you<sup>-asws</sup>?’ So I<sup>-asws</sup> narrated it to both of them of what he<sup>-saww</sup> had said.

<p>Sulaym said, ‘I was present with Ali<sup>-asws</sup> when Zyad Bin Ubeyd returned after his victory against the people of Al-Jamal, and that his house was filled with the companions of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>

<p>(Sulaym) said, ‘He<sup>-asws</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup> and said: ‘Having said that, what has been experienced for the community after its Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>, since he<sup>-saww</sup> passed away. Umar and his companions stood up, and imposed Abu Bakr upon me<sup>-asws</sup>. They pledged allegiance to him whilst I<sup>-asws</sup> was busy with the washing of the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and shrouding him<sup>-saww</sup>, and burying him<sup>-saww</sup>, and I<sup>-asws</sup> was not free from that and they had pledged their allegiances to him and antagonised the Helpers by my<sup>-asws</sup> arguments and my<sup>-asws</sup> rights. By Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, they knew with conviction of what they had meted out, I<sup>-asws</sup> was more deserving of it than Abu Bakr.</p>
<p>فلما رأيت اجتماعهم عليه وتركهم إياي ناشدتهم الله عز وجل وحملت فاطمة عليها السلام على حمار وأخذت بيد ابني الحسن والحسين لعلهم يرعوون، فلم أدع أحدا من أهل بدر ولا أهل السابقة من المهاجرين والأنصار إلا استعنتهم ودعوتهم إلى نصرتي وناشدتهم الله حقي فلم يجيبوني ولم ينصروني.</p>
<p>When I<sup>-asws</sup> saw them gathering to him, and their desertion from me<sup>-asws</sup>, I<sup>-asws</sup> adjured them to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic, and I<sup>-asws</sup> got Fatima<sup>-asws</sup> to ride upon a mule, and took the hands of my<sup>-asws</sup> sons<sup>-asws</sup> Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> and Al-Husayn<sup>-asws</sup>, so that they would change (their actions). So I<sup>-asws</sup> did not leave out anyone from the people of Badr, nor the former people from the Emigrants and the Helpers except that I<sup>-asws</sup> sought their help and called them to my<sup>-asws</sup> help, and adjured them to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> for my<sup>-asws</sup> rights. They neither answered me<sup>-asws</sup> nor did they help me<sup>-asws</sup>.</p>
<p>أنتم تعلمون يا معاشر من حضر من أهل بدر أني لم أقل إلا حقا. قالوا: صدقت يا أمير المؤمنين وبررت، فنستغفر الله من ذلك ونتوب إليه. قال: وكان الناس قريبي عهد بالجاهلية فخشيت فرقة أمة محمد واختلاف كلمتهم، وذكرت ما عهد إلي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لأنه أخبرني بما صنعوا وأمرني: إن وجدت أعوانا جاهدتهم وإن لم أجد أعوانا كففت يدي وحقنت دمي.</p>
<p>You all know, O group who are present from the people of Badr, that I<sup>-asws</sup> have not said except for the truth’. They said, ‘You<sup>-asws</sup> have spoken the truth, O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> and have justified yourself<sup>-asws</sup>. So we seek Forgiveness of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> from that, and repent to Him<sup>-azwj</sup>’.</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘The people were closer to the era or ignorance, so I<sup>-asws</sup> feared the disintegration of the community of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> and differing in their speech, and I<sup>-asws</sup> remembered what oath the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> had given to me<sup>-asws</sup>, because he<sup>-saww</sup> had informed me<sup>-asws</sup> of what they would be doing and ordered me<sup>-asws</sup> that if I<sup>-asws</sup> were to find helpers, then I<sup>-asws</sup> should fight them, and that if I<sup>-asws</sup> do not find helpers, I<sup>-asws</sup> should withhold my<sup>-asws</sup> hand and save my<sup>-asws</sup> blood.</p>
<p>ثم ردها أبو بكر إلى عمر – ووالله إنه ليعلم يقينا أني أحق بها من عمر – فكرهت الفرقة فبايعت وسمعت وأطعت.</p>
<p>Then Abu Bakr handed it (Caliphate) to Umar – and by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, he knew it, without doubt, that I<sup>-asws</sup> was more deserving of it than Umar – I<sup>-asws</sup> disliked the disintegration, but did not (oppose) his allegiance, and kept quiet, and obeyed (Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and His Prophet<sup>-saww</sup>).</p>
<p>ثم جعلني عمر سادس ستة فولى الأمر ابن عوف، فخلا بابن عفان فجعلها له على أن يردها عليه ثم بايعه، فكرهت الفرقة والاختلاف.</p>
<p>Then Umar made me<sup>-asws</sup> to be the sixth one of the six (in the consultation council). He made Ibn Awf to be in-charge of it. So he met Ibn Affan in private and made it (Caliphate) to be for him on the condition that he returns it back to him. Then I<sup>-asws</sup> (did not object) to his allegiance, for I<sup>-asws</sup> disliked the disintegration and the differing.</p>
<p>ثم إن عثمان غدر بابن عوف وزواها عنه، فبرء منه ابن عوف وقام خطيبا فخلعه كما خلع نعله. ثم مات ابن عوف وأوصى أن لا يصلي عليه عثمان، وزعم ولد ابن عوف أن عثمان سمه. ثم قتل، واجتمع الناس ثلاثة أيام يتشاورون في أمرهم. ثم أتوني فبايعوني طائعين غير مكرهين.</p>
<p>Then Usman betrayed Ibn Awf and kept it from him. He distanced himself from Ibn Awf and stood up to give a sermon and took him off like he took of his slipper. The Ibn Awf died, and made a will that Usman would not Pray on him (funeral Prayer), and the sons of Ibn Awf alleged that Usman poisoned him.</p>
<p>Then he (Usman) was killed, and the people gathered for three days, having consultations regarding their command. Then they gave it to me<sup>-asws</sup>, so they pledged their allegiances to me<sup>-asws</sup> willingly, without abhorrence’.</p>
<p><strong><u>امتحن الله المسلمين بأمهم عائشة </u></strong></p>

Then they diverted themselves to Mecca. So they went with Ayesha to the people of Mudra (Al-Basra), ignorant ones of little understanding. So they got them to break their allegiances with me<sup>-asws</sup> and made (shedding of) my<sup>-asws</sup> blood to be permissible’.</p>
<p>ثم ذكر عليه السلام عائشة وخروجها من بيتها وما ركبت منه. فقال عمار: (يا أمير المؤمنين، كف عنها فإنها أمك) فترك ذكرها وأخذ في شيئ آخر، ثم عاد إلى ذكرها فقال أشد مما قال أولا.</p>

<p>فقال عمار: (يا أمير المؤمنين، كف عنها فإنها أمك) فأعرض عن ذكرها ثم عاد الثالثة فقال أشد مما قال.</p>
<p>Amaar said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, <u>refrain from it, for she is your mother’</u>. So he<sup>-asws</sup> left mentioning it, then returned for a third time, so he spoke in even stronger words (against her) than what he<sup>-asws</sup> had said before.</p>
<p>قال: فقال عمار: (يا أمير المؤمنين، كف عنها فإنها أمك) فقال: كلا، إني مع الله على من خالفه، وإن أمكم ابتلاكم الله بها ليعلم أمعه تكونون أم معها؟</p>
<p>Amaar said, ‘O Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup>, <u>refrain from it, for she is your<sup>-asws</sup> mother’</u>. Amir-ul-Momineen<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘Never!

<p>Sulaym said, ‘Then Ali<sup>-asws</sup> mentioned the pledging of allegiances to Abu Bakr, and Umar and Usman. He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘By my<sup>-asws</sup> life, do you reckon the matter was as they are saying it to be? No, by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, it is not as they are saying it to be’. Then he<sup>-asws</sup> was silent.</p>
<p>فقال له عمار: وما يقولون؟ فقال: يقولون (إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لم يستخلف أحدا وإنهم إنما تركوا ليتشاوروا)، ففعلوا غير ما أمروا في قوله. فقد بايع القوم أبا بكر عن غير مشورة ولا رضى من أحد، ثم أكرهوني وأصحابي على البيعة.</p>
<p>Amaar said to him<sup>-asws</sup>, ‘And what are they saying?’ He<sup>-asws</sup> said:&nbsp; (They are saying) ‘that the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> did not appoint (as a Caliph) anyone, and they have been left to consult with each other about it’, so then they did that which was different to what he<sup>-saww</sup> had ordered to be done as per their words. The group pledged their allegiances to Abu Bakr without the satisfaction of anybody, then they compelled me<sup>-asws</sup> and my<sup>-asws</sup> companions for the allegiance.</p>
<p>ثم بايع أبو بكر عمر عن غير مشورة. ثم جعلها عمر شورى بين ستة رهط وأخرج من ذلك جميع الأنصار والمهاجرين إلا هؤلاء الستة ثم قال: (يصلي صهيب بالناس ثلاثة أيام)، ثم أمر الناس: (إن مضت ثلاثة أيام ولم يفرغ القوم أن تضرب رقابهم، وإن اجتمع أربعة وخالف اثنان أن يقتلوا الاثنين). ثم تشاوروا في ثلاثة أيام وكانت بيعتهم عن مشورة من جماعتهم وملأهم، ثم صنعوا ما رأيتم</p>
<p>Then Abu Bakr pledged his allegiance to Umar without any consultation. Then Umar made it to be in a consultation council (Al-Shura) between a group of six, and kept out from that all the Helpers and the Emigrants except for those six.</p>
<p>Then he said, ‘Soheeb will lead the Prayer with the people for three days’. He then ordered the people that, ‘If three days go by and they do not come to any conclusion, strike their necks, and if four of them are agreed upon it and two of them oppose it, then kill those two’. Then they consulted regarding me<sup>-asws</sup> for three days (after the death of Usman), and the pledging of their allegiance was with consultation with their group and fulfilled it. Then they did what you have seen’.</p>

<p>When I<sup>-asws</sup> did find helpers after the killing of Usman to establish the Order of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and revive the Book and the Sunnah, I<sup>-asws</sup> did not have the leeway to restrain the hand. So I<sup>-asws</sup> extended my<sup>-asws</sup> hand and fought against those breakers (of the allegiance). And tomorrow, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Willing, I<sup>-asws</sup> will fight against the deviants in the land of Syria in a place called ‘Siffeen’. Then, after that, I<sup>-asws</sup> will fight against the renegades (apostates) in a land from the lands of Iraq, which is called ‘Al-Nahrwaan’.</p>
<p>أمرني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بقتالهم في هذه المواطن الثلاث. وكففت يدي لغير عجز ولا جبن ولا كراهية للقاء ربي، ولكن لطاعة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وحفظ وصيته.</p>
<p>The Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup> ordered me<sup>-asws</sup> to fight them in these three places. And I<sup>-asws</sup> restrained my<sup>-asws</sup> hand (before) due to the reasons other than frustration, and cowardice or disliking the meeting with my<sup>-asws</sup> Lord<sup>-azwj</sup> (death) but it was in obedience to the Rasool Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and the preservation of (the stipulations in) his<sup>-saww</sup> will.</p>
<p>فلما وجدت أعوانا نظرت فلم أجد بين السبيلين ثالثا: إما الجهاد في سبيل الله والأمر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر، أو الكفر بالله والجهود بما أنزل الله ومعالجة الأغلال في نار جهنم والارتداد عن الإسلام.</p>
<p>So when I<sup>-asws</sup> did find helpers, I<sup>-asws</sup> considered and could not find between two ways, a third one – either I<sup>-asws</sup> struggle in the Way of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and enjoin the good and forbid the evil, or become an infidel by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and struggle against what Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Revealed, and face the shackles in the Fire of Hell and become an apostate from Al-Islam (I<sup>-asws</sup> preferred the former option).</p>

<p>And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> had Made Haroun<sup>-as</sup> to be in a time period when he<sup>-as</sup> was considered to be weak, and they had plotted to kill him<sup>-as</sup>, and he<sup>-as</sup> did not find helpers against them.

<p><a name="_Toc340823278"></a><a name="_Toc341095830"></a>Branches of the debauchery (Seduction)</p>
<p>And the debauchery has four branches – the disloyalty, the blind (following), and the negligence, and the arrogance. So the one who is disloyal will despise the truth, and abhor the people of understanding, and will insist on committing great sins.</p>
<p>ومن عمى نسي الذكر واتبع الظن وبارز خالقه وألح عليه الشيطان وطلب المغفرة بلا توبة ولا استكانة ولا غفلة.</p>
<p>And the one who is blind (follower) will forget the Remembrance and follow the conjectures and go against his Creator and the Satan<sup>-la</sup> will urge him to seek Forgiveness without repentance, neither was he submissiveness, nor ignorant.</p>
<p>ومن غفل جنى على نفسه وانقلب على ظهره وحسب غيه رشدا وغرته الأماني، وأخذته الحسرة والندامة إذا قضي الأمر وانكشف عنه الغطاء وبدا له ما لم يكن يحتسب.</p>
<p>And the one who is negligent will deceive himself, and turn around backwards, and consider his error to be the right way, and his aspirations will deceive him, and he will be overtaken by regret and remorse if the matter transpires, and the cover is lifted from him, and it appears to him different to what he had considered it to be.</p>
<p>ومن عتا عن أمر الله شك، ومن شك تعالى الله عليه فأذله بسلطانه وصغره بجلاله كما اغتر بربه الكريم وفرط في أمره.</p>
<p>And the one who is arrogant about the Command of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will doubt, and the one who doubts Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> the High will Disgrace him by his<sup>-azwj</sup> Authority, and Belittle him by His<sup>-azwj</sup> Majesty just as he had (tried to) deceive his Generous Lord<sup>-azwj</sup>, and left His<sup>-azwj</sup> Commands’.</p>
<p><strong><u>شعب الغلو </u></strong></p>
<p>والغلو على أربع شعب: على التعمق بالرأي والتنازع فيه والزيغ والشقاق.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc340823279"></a><a name="_Toc341095831"></a>Branches of the exaggeration (Al-Ghuloo)</p>
<p>And the exaggeration has four branches – Delving into opinions, and conflict over it, and the deviation and the discord.</p>
<p>فمن تعمق لم ينب إلى الحق ولم يزدد إلا غرقا في الغمرات ولم تنحسر عنه فتنة إلا غشيته أخرى وانخرق دينه فهو يهوي في أمر مريج.</p>
<p>So the one who delves (into opinions) will not get to the truth, and it will not increase him (in anything) except for his sinking even deeper into the distress, and the strife (Al-Fitna) will never recede from him, except make him fall into another one again, and it will shred his Religion, so he will fall into more confusion.</p>
<p>ومن نازع في الرأي وخاصم شهر بالعثل من طول اللجاج.</p>
<p>And the one who disputes in the opinions and antagonises by it, will become well known for his lengthy challenges (debates).</p>
<p>ومن زاغ قبحت عنده الحسنة وحسنت عنده السيئة،</p>
<p>And the one who deviates, the beautiful (deeds) will seem to be ugly to him, and the ugly (deeds) will seem to be beautiful.</p>
<p>ومن شاق أعورت عليه طرقه واعترض عليه أمره فضاق عليه مخرجه إذا لم يتبع سبيل المؤمنين.</p>
<p>And the one who disunites, his way will seem to be lacking and will be opposed in his affairs. So his exit (from the group) will be constrictive to him if he does not follow the way of the Believers.</p>
<p><strong><u>شعب الشك </u></strong></p>
<p>والشك على أربع شعب: على المرية والهوى والتردد والاستسلام، وهو قول الله عز وجل: (فبأي آلاء ربك تتمارى).</p>
<p><a name="_Toc340823280"></a><a name="_Toc341095832"></a>Branches of the doubt</p>
<p>And the doubt has four branches – the dispute, and the desire, and the hesitation, and the surrender (giving up), and it is the Statement of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic: <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[53:55] Which of your Lord’s benefits will you then dispute about?”</em></strong></p>
<p>فمن هاله ما بين يديه نكص على عقبيه ومن امترى في الدين تردد في الريب وسبقه الأولون من المؤمنين وأدركه الآخرون ووطئته سنابك الشيطان.</p>
<p>The one who is petrified of what is in front of him will turn back on his heels, and the one who disputes in the Religion will frequently be in (deep) uncertainties, and the former ones from the Believers will move in front of him, and the later ones will catch up with him, and he will be trod on by the feet of the Satan<sup>-la</sup>.</p>
<p>ومن استسلم لهلكة الدنيا والآخرة هلك فيما بينهما، ومن نجا من ذلك فمن فضل اليقين، ولم يخلق الله خلقا أقل من اليقين.</p>
<p>And the one who surrenders (gives up) due to the severe exhaustion of the world and the Hereafter will perish in what is in between them, and the one who will achieve salvation from that is the one who preferred the conviction (certainty), and Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> did not Create (anything) less than conviction (certainty).</p>
<p><strong><u>شعب الشبهة </u></strong></p>
<p>والشبهة على أربع شعب: إعجاب بالزينة وتسويل النفس وتأويل العوج ولبس الحق بالباطل.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc340823281"></a><a name="_Toc341095833"></a>Branches of the suspicion</p>
<p>And the suspicion has four branches – Admiration of the ornament, and the deceiving of one’s own self, and the corrupt interpretation, and clothing the truth with the falsehood (hypocrisy).</p>
<p>وذلك بأن الزينة تصدف عن البينة، وإن تسويل النفس يقحم على الشهوة، وإن العوج يميل بصاحبه ميلا عظيما، وإن اللبس ظلمات بعضها فوق بعض.</p>
<p>And that by the ornaments you will turn away from the clear proof, and the deceiving of the soul intrudes upon the desires, and the corruption fills its owner with a great filling, and that the hypocrisy (clothing the truth with the falsehood) leads to darkness upon darkness.</p>
<p>فذلك الكفر ودعائمه وشعبه.</p>
<p>So that is the infidelity and its foundations, and its branches.</p>
<p><strong><u>* 2 * دعائم النفاق </u></strong></p>
<p>قال عليه السلام: والنفاق على أربع دعائم: على الهوى والهوينا والحفيظة والطمع.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc340823282"></a><a name="_Toc341095834"></a>2 – The foundations of the hypocrisy</p>
<p>He<sup>-asws</sup> said: ‘And the hypocrisy is based upon four foundations – Upon the desires, and the negligence, and the prejudice, and the greed.</p>
<p><strong><u>شعب الهوى </u></strong></p>
<p>فالهوى على أربع شعب: على البغي والعدوان والشهوة والطغيان.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc340823283"></a><a name="_Toc341095835"></a>Branches of the desire</p>
<p>The Desire has four branches – the rebellion, and the aggression, and the lust, and the tyranny.</p>
<p>فمن بغي كثرت غوائله وتخلى منه ونصر عليه.</p>
<p>The one who rebels would be in numerous difficulties, and he would be left alone and help would be sought against him.</p>
<p>ومن اعتدى لم تؤمن بوائقه، ولم يسلم قلبه ولم يملك نفسه عن الشهوات. ومن لم يعذل نفسه في الشهوات خاض في الخبيثات، ومن طغى ضل على عمد بلا حجة.</p>
<p>The one who is aggressive will neither be safe even from his trustworthy (allies), nor his heart will be safe and nor he will not be able to control himself from the lusts. The one who does not isolate himself from the lusts will indulge in the evil acts, and the one who is tyrannical goes astray without any justification.</p>
<p><strong><u>شعب الهوينا </u></strong></p>
<p>والهوينا على أربع شعب: على الغرة والأمل والهيبة والمماطلة.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc340823284"></a><a name="_Toc341095836"></a>Branches of the Negligence</p>
<p>And the negligence is upon four branches. It is upon the indolence, and the hope, and the prestige, and the procrastination.</p>
<p>وذلك بأن الهيبة ترد عن الحق، والمماطلة تفرط في العمل حتى يقدم عليه الأجل.</p>
<p>And that prestige will repulse from the truth, and the procrastination lays waste to the work until the death comes to him.</p>
<p>ولولا الأمل علم الإنسان حساب ما هو فيه، ولو علم حساب ما هو فيه مات خفاتا من الهول والوجل.</p>
<p>And had it not been for hope, the human being would come to know the situation he is in, and if he knows what he is in, he would die due to the fear from the horror and apprehension.</p>
<p>والغرة تقصر بالمرء عن العمل.</p>
<p>And the indolence makes a man neglect his work.</p>
<p><strong><u>شعب الحفيظة </u></strong></p>
<p>والحفيظة على أربع شعب: على الكبر والفخر والحمية والعصبية.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc340823285"></a><a name="_Toc341095837"></a>Branches of the Prejudice</p>
<p>And the prejudice is upon four branches. It is upon the arrogance, and the pride, and the impertinence and the discrimination.</p>
<p>فمن استكبر أدبر من الحق، ومن فخر فجر، ومن حمى أصر على الذنوب، ومن أخذته العصبية جار. فبئس الأمر أمر بين إدبار وفجور وإصرار وجور على الصراط.</p>
<p>The one who is arrogant will depart from the truth, and the one who is proud will be immoral, and the one who is impertinent (snobby) will insist on the sinning, and the one who is overtaken by discrimination will be unjust. So, evil is the matter, the matter between the departure (from the truth), and the injustices and the immoralities, and the insistence on sinning, and being tyrannical upon the straight path.</p>
<p><strong><u>شعب الطمع </u></strong></p>
<p>والطمع على أربع شعب: الفرح والمرح واللجاجة والتكاثر.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc340823286"></a><a name="_Toc341095838"></a>Branches of the greed</p>
<p>And the greed is upon four branches – being over joyful, and being boastful, and being quarrelsome, and being the proud.</p>
<p>فالفرح مكروه عند الله، والمرح خيلاء، واللجاجة بلاء لمن اضطرته إلى حمل الآثام، والتكاثر لهو ولعب وشغل واستبدال الذي هو أدنى بالذي هو خير.</p>
<p>Being overjoyed is Considered abhorrent by Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, and the boastful is the vanity, and being quarrelsome is a scourge and gets one to carry the burden of the sins, and being proud leads one to useless and time wasting activities.</p>
<p>فذلك النفاق ودعائمه وشعبه.</p>
<p>So that is the hypocrisy and its foundations and its branches.</p>
<p><strong><u>سنن إلهية في الخلق </u></strong></p>
<p>والله قاهر فوق عباده، تعالى ذكره وجل وجهه وأحسن كل شيئ خلقه وانبسطت يداه ووسعت كل شيئ رحمته وظهر أمره وأشرق نوره وفاضت بركته واستضاءت حكمته وهيمن كتابه وفلجت حجته وخلص دينه واستظهر سلطانه وحقت كلمته وأقسطت موازينه وبلغت رسله.</p>
<p>And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> is Compelling over His<sup>-azwj</sup> creatures, High is His<sup>-azwj</sup> Remembrance, and Majectic is His<sup>-azwj</sup> Face, and beautiful is everything that He<sup>-azwj</sup> Created, and Extended (Generous) is His<sup>-azwj</sup> Hand, and everything has been Overcome by His<sup>-azwj</sup> Mercy, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Command is manifest, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Light is Shining, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Blessings are overflowing, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Wisdom is Illuminating, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Book is Dominating, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Proofs are Decisive, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> religion is Pure, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Authority is Apparent, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Words are True, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Scale is Balanced, and His<sup>-azwj</sup> Message has reached.</p>
<p>فجعل السيئة ذنبا، والذنب فتنة، والفتنة دنسا، وجعل الحسنى عتبى، والعتبى توبة، والتوبة طهورا. فمن تاب اهتدى، ومن افتتن غوى ما لم يتب إلى الله ويعترف بذنبه ولا يهلك على الله إلا هالك.</p>
<p>So He<sup>-azwj</sup> made the bad (deed) to be a sin, and the sin to be ‘fitna’ strife, and the strife to be filth. And He<sup>-azwj</sup> made the good (deed) to be a blessing, and the blessing to be repentance, and the repentance to be pure. So the one who is repentant will be guided, and the one who is involved in ‘fitna’ (strife) will go astray and will not repent to Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and will admit his guilt, and he who goes against Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> will perish.</p>
<p>الله، الله فما أوسع ما لديه من التوبة والرحمة والبشرى والحلم العظيم. وما أنكل ما عنده من الأنكال والجحيم والبطش الشديد.</p>
<p>Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, how broad and near to them is the Repentance, and the Mercy, and the Good news, and the Great Forbearance. And how severe is what is with Him<sup>-azwj</sup> from the Fetters, and the Hell, and the Grievous Punishment.</p>
<p>فمن ظفر بطاعته اجتلب كرامته، ومن دخل في معصيته ذاق وبال نقمته، وعما قليل ليصبحن نادمين.</p>
<p>So the one who succeeded by being obedient to Him<sup>-azwj</sup> will be the recipient of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Honour, and the one entered in being disobedient to Him<sup>-azwj</sup> will taste the scourge of His<sup>-azwj</sup> Retribution, and so few are the ones who are repentant.’</p>

<p><strong><em>“[22:1] O people! guard against (the punishment from) your Lord; surely the violence of the hour is a grievous thing.

<p>فرات في تفسيره والحسكاني في شواهد التنزيل: حدثني جعفر بن محمد بن هشام، عن عبادة بن زياد، عن أبي معمر سعيد بن خثيم، عن محمد بن خالد الضبي وعبد الله بن شريك العامري، عن سليم بن قيس عن الحسن بن على عليه السلام: إنه حمد الله تعالى وأثنى عليه وقال: (السابقون الأولون من المهاجرين والأنصار والذين اتبعوهم بإحسان)، فكما أن للسابقين فضلهم على من بعدهم كذلك لأبي علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام فضيلته على السابقين بسبقه السابقين.</p>
<p>Furaat in his Commentary (Tafseer), and Al-Haskaany in <em>Shawaahid Al-Tanzeel</em>, said, ‘Narrated to me Ja’far Bin Muhammad Bin Hashaam, from Abaadat Bin Ziyad, from Abu Ma’mar Saeed Bin Khaseem, from Muhammad Bin Khalid Al-Zaby, and Abdullah Bin Shareek Al-Aamiry, from Sulaym Bin Qays, who has narrated the following:</p>
<p>Al-Hassan<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Praised Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and Extolled Him<sup>-azwj</sup>, and said: <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>[9:100] And (as for) the foremost, the first of the Muhajirs and the Ansars, and those who followed them in goodness,”</em></strong> so if the former ones have a preference over those who came after them, similarly for Ali<sup>-asws</sup> Bin Abu Talib<sup>-asws</sup> there is a preference over the former ones for being before the former ones.</p>
<p>وقال: (أجعلتم سقاية الحاج وعمارة المسجد الحرام كمن آمن بالله واليوم الآخر وجاهد في سبيل الله) واستجاب لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وواساه بنفسه. ثم عمه حمزة سيد الشهداء وقد كان قتل معه كثير، فكان حمزة سيدهم بقرابته من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p>And said: <strong><em>“[9:19] What! do you make (one who undertakes) the giving of drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred Masjid like him who believes in Allah and the latter day and strives hard in Allah’s way?”</em></strong>, and He<sup>-azwj</sup> Answered the Messenger of Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> and made him<sup>-asws</sup> (Ali<sup>-asws</sup>) to be equal to none but himself<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>Then his<sup>-saww</sup> uncle Hamza<sup>-as</sup> is the Chief of the Martyrs and a lot of people had been killed along with him<sup>-as</sup>, so Hamza<sup>-as</sup> was their Chief due to his<sup>-as</sup> nearness to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>ثم جعل الله لجعفر جناحين يطير بهما مع الملائكة في الجنة حيث يشاء. وذلك لمكانهما وقرابتهما من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ومنزلتهما منه. وصلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله على حمزة سبعين صلاة من بين الشهداء الذين استشهدوا معه.</p>
<p>Then Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> made two wings for Ja’far<sup>-as</sup> for him<sup>-as</sup> to fly around with the Angels in the Paradise wherever he<sup>-as</sup> so desires to. And that is both their place, and their nearness to the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>, and their status from him<sup>-saww</sup>. And he<sup>-saww</sup> recited seventy Prayers for him<sup>-as</sup>, although there were (other) martyrs that were martyred along with him<sup>-as</sup>.</p>
<p>وجعل لنساء النبي صلى الله عليه وآله فضلا على غيرهن لمكانهن من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله.</p>
<p>And He<sup>-azwj</sup> Made for the wives of the prophet<sup>-saww</sup> to have preference over others due to their place from (connection with) the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup>.</p>
<p>وفضل الله الصلاة في مسجد النبي صلى الله عليه وآله بألف صلاة على سائر المساجد إلا المسجد الذي ابتناه إبراهيم عليه السلام بمكة، لمكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وفضله.</p>
<p>And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Preferred the Prayer in the Masjid of the Prophet<sup>-saww</sup> over a thousand Prayers in the rest of the Masjids, except for the Masjid which Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup> built at Mecca, due to its place (connection) with the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> and its preference.</p>
<p>وعلم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله الناس الصلوات، فقال: قولوا: <u>(اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد كما صليت على إبراهيم وآل إبراهيم إنك حميد مجيد)</u>.</p>
<p>And the Messenger of Allah<sup>-saww</sup> taught the people, the greeting (Salawaat), so he<sup>-saww</sup> said: ‘You should say, <u>‘Our Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>, Send greetings upon Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> and the Progeny<sup>-asws</sup> of Muhammad<sup>-saww</sup> just as You <sup>-azwj</sup> Sent upon Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup> and the Progeny of Ibrahim<sup>-as</sup>, for You <sup>-azwj</sup> are the Praiseworthy, the Glorious’</u>.</p>
<p>فحقنا على كل مسلم أن يصلي علينا مع الصلاة فريضة واجبة من الله.</p>
<p>For our<sup>-asws</sup> rights upon every Muslim is that he should send greetings upon us<sup>-asws</sup> along with the Prayer as a necessary Obligation from Allah<sup>-azwj</sup>.</p>
<p>وأحل الله لرسوله الغنيمة وأحلها لنا، وحرم الصدقات عليه وحرمها علينا، كرامة أكرمنا الله وفضيلة فضلنا الله بها.</p>
<p>And Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> Made it Permissible for His<sup>-azwj</sup> Messenger the war booty and Made it to be Permissible for us<sup>-asws</sup>, and Prohibited the charity to him<sup>-saww</sup> and Made it to be Prohibited for us<sup>-asws</sup>, an honour which Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Honoured us<sup>-asws</sup> with, and a ‘فضيلة’ preference which Allah<sup>-azwj</sup> has Preferred us<sup>-asws</sup> by it.</p>
